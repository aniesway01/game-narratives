A messenger that told of war.\n\nHe was called to action, but refused it. He simply \nwished for a quiet life.\n\nWar would not give it to him, though. His quaint \nvillage of exile burned away from the march \nof conquest.\nIn his anger, he reclaimed a sword of royal \nsuccession, and led an army through many battles \nto the doorsteps of the perpetrators.\nAnd so they burned as well.\n\nThame had struck at the heart of the villains. Every \nweakness was an untold story to unravel the \nenemy.\nHis army continued its march to his land of origin, \nwhere he found his brother Raiga sitting on the \nthrone.\nBut Raiga created a shield against Thame's strikes. \nA shield that would not crack.\n\nWith every failure, Thame's desperation grew \nand grew.\n\nIt grew until the sword thrust once more into the \nshield, only to crack itself.\n\nSo desperate to find a weakness of his brother, \nThame had succumb to his own.\n\nAnd the world knew peace, for a time.\n\nA peace where the resilient shield glimmered in the \nsunlit sky from sea to shining sea.\n\nFrom these legends came two Oathbreakers... \nEul'raiga and Eul'thame.\n\nOne a symbol of ideals.
