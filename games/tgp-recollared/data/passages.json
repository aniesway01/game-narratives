That's how I know Elara's already awake - she always bites when she wants something.\n\n\"Going somewhere, hero?\" Her voice drips honey and mischief. Auburn hair spills across our sheets like spilled wine, and those sapphire eyes of hers - they'd make a lesser man forget his own name. Fortune favors me—I've never been lesser.\n\n[Image: My darling wife!\nOutside, Eboncrest groans awake. Cart wheels on cobblestone, the baker's daughter cursing at flour sacks, old Henrik arguing with his mule about the meaning of forward. My town. My people. But right now, my wife's got her thigh hooked over mine and her fingers tracing the scar where that wyvern nearly took my liver three summers back.\n\n\"Mayor wants me at the west gate by second bell,\" I tell her, but my hands are already contradicting my words, tracing each knob of her spine, down to where her waist kicks out into those hips. Hips that have ruined better men than me.\n\n\"Second bell.\" She grins, wicked as a blade. \"That's ages from now.\"\n\nDawn's barely cracked. The bedroom still holds night's chill, but Elara's skin burns fever-hot against mine. Always does. Like she swallowed dawn whole and keeps it burning somewhere beneath that freckled flesh.\n\n\"You're thinking with your sword again,\" she teases, grinding against me just enough to prove her point.\n\n\"Both of them, apparently.\"\n\nThat earns me a laugh—full-bodied, belly-deep, the sort that vibrates through both of us. Elara. Six years wed and she still unravels me like I'm some green boy seeing his first pair of—\n\nShe rolls on top of me. The full weight of her settles across my hips—warm thighs squeezing, tits swaying heavy as she adjusts, nipples dragging across my chest. Morning light catches the copper in her hair and she looks like something men start wars over. She rolls her hips in slow circles, grinding down, and every thought I've ever had turns to soup—\n\n\"Focus, soldier.\" She pins my wrists above my head. As if she could actually hold me down.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"",

      "text": "I flip her like she weighs nothing.\n\n\"Think you're in charge?\" My voice comes out rougher than intended.\n\nShe tries to wiggle free, laughing, but I pin both her wrists with one hand. The other yanks her nightgown up, bunching white linen around her waist. That perfect peach of an ass exposed in morning light - pale as cream, soft as sin.\n\n\"Someone's feeling brave this mor—\"\n\n**CRACK.** My palm meets her ass, the sound echoing off our bedroom walls.\n\n\"Aldric!\" But she's already pushing back, wanting more.\n\n\"That's 'sir' when I've got you bent over.\" Another spank, harder. Her flesh jiggles, turns pink under my hand. \"Or would you prefer the whole street knows what we're doing?\"\n\n\"Like they don't already—ah!\"\n\nI grab a fistful of auburn hair, pull her up on all fours. \"They're about to know exactly how Aldric the Great breeds his woman.\"\n\nOne thrust and I'm buried to the hilt. She's soaked—been ready since she woke, the greedy thing—and so tight I have to lock my jaw to keep from finishing right there. We both groan.\n\n\"Fuck! Warn a girl before you—\"\n\n\"Before I what?\" I pull almost all the way out, slam back home. \"Before I take what's mine?\"\n\nThe bed frame bangs against the wall. Good. Let every gossip in Eboncrest know I'm putting a baby in my wife before I go kill their monsters.\n\n\"Flux take me—ngh—you're insatiable!\"\n\n\"You *love* being taken like a tavern wench.\" I reach around—her clit swollen and ready.\n\n\"I'm your—*ah!*—your wife, you *brute*!\"\n\n\"My wife who's about to scream loud enough to wake the baker.\"\n\nI stop holding back. Each thrust drives her forward on the sheets, and her asscheeks ripple and clap against my hips—**PLAP PLAP PLAP**—the wet, meaty sound of a woman getting properly fucked. Her back arches deeper, showing me everything, and she's so wet it's running down her thighs.\n\n\"Go on, love. Let them hear you.\"\n\n> 1)[HINT: look for text with lots of alliteration - they might hide **hidden gems** 💎, which give you extra **redo points** to try different story options.\n\nDifferent branches can have extra gems!\n\n**Try clicking the sentence after this!**]\n\n[Image: Perfect fit—like Whisperwind to sheath.\n\"You're going to—*fuck*—split me in half!\"\n\n\"You can take it.\" I pull her hair tighter, force her back to arch. The new angle makes her gasp. \"Taken worse from me on our wedding night.\"\n\n\"That was—oh gods—different!\"\n\n\"How?\" Another spank, watching her asscheek jiggle. \"Because the whole inn heard you then too?\"\n\nShe's pushing back to meet every thrust now, our bodies locked into that rhythm we've built over six years. Her nightgown's completely bunched around her ribs, tits swaying freely beneath her. I lean over, grab one, squeeze just hard enough.\n\n\"Aldric! I'm—I'm close!\"\n\n\"Already? We've barely started.\" But I rub her clit faster, knowing exactly the pressure she needs. \"Come on then. Cum on your husband's cock like a good little wife.\"\n\n**SPANK!**\n\n\"I'll—*ah!*—kill you for that—later!\"\n\n\"If you can still walk later, I haven't done my job.\"\n\nThat does it. She screams as her pussy clamps down on me. Her whole body shakes, and I have to grip her hips hard to keep fucking her through it. The wet sounds get louder, obscene, perfect.\n\n\"That's one,\" I growl. \"Want to go for two before I breed you?\"\n\n\"You cocky—oh FUCK!\"\n\nI've shifted angle again, hitting that spot inside her that makes her clench. She's so wet now it's running down both our thighs.\n\n\"Listen to that,\" I tell her, punctuating with a particularly hard thrust. \"That's the sound of a well-fucked wife.\"\n\n\"Going to—ngh—put me through the mattress!\"\n\n\"Then you'll remember this while I'm gone.\" I lean down, bite her shoulder through the nightgown. \"Remember who you belong to.\"\n\nI grab a big handful of that gorgeous ass. Flux's balls, this woman.\n\nHer pussy starts fluttering again. Close. I reach around with both hands now - one on her clit, one pulling her hair.\n\n\"Cum for me, Elara. Show Eboncrest how their hero's wife takes his cock.\"\n\nShe does. Harder than before, her whole body going rigid then exploding into shakes. The neighbors definitely heard that one. Good.\n\n\"My turn,\" I grunt, feeling the tightness building in my balls.\n\n\"Yes! Give me—give me everything!\"\n\nI slam home one final time and explode. My cock pulses hard, pumping rope after rope of cum deep inside her. I hold her hips bruisingly tight, making sure she takes every drop, grinding against her ass as I empty my balls completely.\n\n\"*FUCK,* Elara!\" It comes out as a roar. Let them all hear. Let them know Aldric the Great is putting an heir in his wife's belly.\n\nShe's still cumming, her pussy milking me for everything I've got. \"That's it, that's it, fill me up!\"\n\nI keep grinding into her, working my cum deeper, until we're both shaking and gasping. When I finally pull out, I watch my seed immediately start dripping from her well-fucked pussy.\n\n\"Mine,\" I say, giving her ass one more slap.\n\n\"Possessive bastard,\" she pants, collapsing onto the bed. But she's grinning, flushed from her hairline to her tits, my seed already leaking onto the sheets beneath her. \"The whole street probably thinks you're murdering me.\"\n\n\"I was. Slowly. With love.\"\n\nShe throws a pillow at me, laughing so hard her whole body shakes. I flop down beside her, both of us sweaty and ruined. \"And you love me.\"\n\n\"Ephemerals help me, I do.\" She cuddles into my side, nightgown still bunched around her middle. \"Think that one took?\"\n\n\"If volume of screaming affects conception, we're having twins.\"\n\nWe both dissolve into laughter. Gods, I love this woman.\n\n\"Now get up,\" she says, poking my ribs. \"I need to look the baker's wife in the eye later.\"\n\n\"Tell her you were just thanking your husband for his heroic service.\"\n\n\"I'll tell her you're a beast who can't keep his hands to himself.\"\n\n\"Also true.\"\n\nShe kisses me, slow and sweet. \"My beast though.\"\n\n\"Always.\"]I let her hold my wrists for a heartbeat, two, then surge up to kiss her. The kind of kiss that makes her melt, makes her grip loosen. I taste the mint leaves on her tongue, feel her pulse quicken where my lips find her throat.\n\n\"Mmm, there's my hero,\" she sighs, releasing my wrists to thread her fingers through my hair.\n\nMorning light paints her skin gold and cream. Every freckle stands out like constellations I've mapped a thousand times. I run my hands up her thighs, feeling muscle under silk-soft skin. She trains with me sometimes—insists on knowing how to defend herself. Makes her legs strong.\n\n\"You're so perfect,\" I murmur against her collarbone.\n\n\"Flatterer.\" But she's already rocking against me, slow and deliberate. \"You just want what's under my nightgown.\"\n\n\"It IS in the way,\" I sit up, bringing her with me so she's straddling my lap. \"You must admit.\"\n\n[Image: Six years and I still forget to breathe.\nShe laughs, squirming away and peeling the nightgown over her head. Arms up, back arched, tits bouncing free—heavy and round with fat pink nipples already stiff from the cold. That waist I can almost span with both hands, then the flare of her hips, the soft pouch of her belly she hates and I worship. The little scar on her ribs from when she tried to rescue that cat from the Henricks' roof. Six years and the sight of her naked still makes me stupid.\n\nLike now.\n\n\"What?\" she asks, suddenly shy under my gaze.\n\n\"Just remembering why I married you.\"\n\n\"My sparkling personality?\"\n\n\"Your apple tarts.\"\n\nShe shoves my shoulder, laughing. \"Ass.\"\n\n\"That too.\" I cup it, pull her closer. She's already wet against me, leaving slick heat on my stomach. \"But yes, I suppose your personality's good too.\"\n\n\"Just good?\" She rises up on her knees, reaches between us to position me. \"Let me remind you how GREAT it is.\"\n\nShe sinks down slowly. So slowly I might die. Her pussy accepts me inch by inch, velvet heat that fits me like she was made for me. We both groan when she's fully seated, pressed together from chest to groin.\n\n\"Fuck, Elara...\"\n\n\"Every morning,\" she breathes, starting to move. \"Every morning you act surprised.\"\n\n\"Every morning IS a surprise with you.\"\n\nShe rides me like she kneads bread—steady, purposeful, devastating. Each time she rises I see my cock gleaming wet with her, and each time she drops her ass slaps against my thighs with a sound that could wake the dead. Her tits bounce wild, heavy flesh swaying in circles that hypnotize. Her belly flexes. Her mouth falls open and she makes this breathy little \"uh—uh—uh—\" on every downstroke that I will hear in my grave.\n\n> 1)[HINT: look for text with lots of alliteration - they might hide **hidden gems** 💎, which give you extra **redo points** to try different story options.\n\nDifferent branches can have extra gems!\n\n**Try clicking the sentence after this!**]\n\nBirds sing outside our window. A cool breeze carries the scent of her garden—rosemary, lavender, the last of the autumn roses. But all I smell is her. Honey and female musk, the faint trace of the jasmine oil she rubbed into her skin last night.\n\n\"Touch me,\" she whispers.\n\nI know what she needs. My thumb settles on her clit, circles gentle but firm. My other hand cups her breast, rolls the nipple between my fingers. She gasps, rhythm faltering.\n\n\"That's it, love. Let go.\"\n\n\"Not yet—want to—oh gods—together—\"\n\n\"We've got time.\" I sit up straighter, changing the angle. Now I can kiss her while she rides me, can swallow her moans. \"I want to feel it when you cum.\"\n\nShe does. My name on a broken whisper as her whole body trembles. Her pussy clenches around me in waves, trying to pull me deeper. I hold her through it, kiss her temple, breathe in the scent of her hair.\n\n\"Well done,\" I murmur.\n\nShe's still shaking when she starts moving again, oversensitive but determined. \"Your turn.\"\n\n\"Elara, you don't have to—\"\n\n\"Shh.\" She pushes me back down, pins my shoulders. \"My hero needs his strength today.\"\n\nThe new angle does something incredible. Every stroke hits deep, her ass slapping against my thighs in a rhythm as old as time. I grip her hips, just to hold on. the roll of her hips, the muscles working under all that soft skin, all of her alive against all of me.\n\n\"I love watching you like this,\" she says, breathless. \"All that control just... gone. Just you and me and this.\"\n\nShe leans down, changes the angle again. Now her breasts press against my chest, her lips against my ear.\n\n\"I want you to cum inside me, Aldric. Want to feel you let go. Want to carry part of you with me all day while you're gone.\"\n\n\"Elara—\"\n\n\"Maybe this time,\" she whispers. \"Maybe this time it'll take.\"\n\nHer voice cracks on the word *take.* I roll us over. Need her closer. Need her under me. She wraps her legs around my waist, pulls me deep, and we move together like we're one creature. Slow, deep thrusts that build like thunder in the distance.\n\n[Image: The morning sun climbs higher, painting bars of gold across our tangled bodies.\n\n\"Yes,\" she breathes. \"Flux and Verge, you fill me so perfectly...\"\n\nHer nails rake down my back, just enough to ground me in the moment. In her. The morning sun climbs higher, painting bars of gold across our tangled bodies. Sweat makes us slip against each other, adds to the breath and moans and the wet music of our joining.\n\n\"Close,\" I warn.\n\n\"Me too. Again. How do you always—oh GODS—\"\n\nHer second orgasm clamps down on me like a fist. Her legs lock around my waist, heels digging into my ass, pulling me deeper. Her whole body goes rigid—belly pressed tight against mine, tits crushed between us, and I can feel her heart hammering through both our chests.\n\nI bury myself to the root and let go. Each pulse fills her and she gasps with it, fingers clawing my back, milking me with every flutter and squeeze. The sounds I make against her throat are barely human.\n\n[Image: Take it all, love. Every fucking drop.\n\n\"That's it,\" she murmurs, stroking my hair as I shake. \"Every drop is mine.\"\n\nWe stay joined as our breathing slows, trading lazy kisses. A breeze cools our heated skin. Somewhere outside, the baker's rooster crows late, and we both laugh.\n\n\"Think that worked?\" she asks, hand drifting to her stomach.\n\n\"If not...\" I kiss her nose. \"The trying's the best part anyway.\"\n\n\"Flirt.\" But she's smiling, that special smile that's just for me. \"Now get off before my legs go numb.\"\n\n\"Romantic.\"\n\n\"You love it.\"\n\n\"I love YOU.\"\n\n\"Good answer, hero.\" She stretches beneath me, all satisfied cat. \"Now come on. I'm making honey cakes and you need to eat before you go play with those goblins.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, we're in the kitchen. Elara's humming while she works at the stove, wearing nothing but my tunic from yesterday. It hangs to mid-thigh on her, loose at the collar so one freckled shoulder peeks out. Every time she reaches for a shelf, the hem rides up and I get a flash of bare asscheek—round, pale, still pink from my handprints. She knows exactly what she's doing. The hem drops. She reaches for something else. The other cheek this time.\n\nThe smell of woodsmoke bacon fills our little cottage, along with something sweet - she's making honey cakes again. Thick slabs of brown bread wait on the table, alongside a pot of apple butter and fresh churned cream. Simple fare, but when Elara makes it, might as well be a king's feast.\n\n\"Stop staring at my ass and sit down,\" she says without turning around.\n\n\"How'd you know?\"\n\n\"I know all your looks.\" She glances over her shoulder, winks. \"Especially that one.\"\n\nI sit, watch her work. She moves like she does everything—efficient, practiced, worth watching.\n\nShe sets a plate in front of me - bacon crispy as autumn leaves, two honey cakes still steaming, bread thick with apple butter. My stomach growls appreciation.\n\n\"So,\" she says, settling across from me with her own plate. \"Goblins at the mine?\"",

Worth it. \"Just plucking weeds before they choke the crop.\"\n\nShe sets down a mug of bark tea with more force than necessary. \"That's what you said about the cockatrice.\"\n\n\"The cockatrice barely nicked me.\"\n\n\"You came home with half your chest hanging open!\"\n\nI catch her wrist, gentle. \"That was two years ago. And I learned my lesson about checking corners.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" She's not really angry. Just worried. I can read it in how she keeps touching things - the table, her locket, the bread knife. \"Because Giles offered to go with you. Said so yesterday at market.\"\n\n\"Giles.\" I snort. \"Good man with a sword, but Goblins don't give a thrack about swords. They care about fire. Wind. The kind of forces that make them remember why they used to fear humans.\"\n\n\"They *used* to fear us?\"\n\n\"Before they learned we're soft.\" I pull her onto my lap. She resists for half a heartbeat, then melts against me. \"That's why they're getting bold. Coming out of the eastern wastes, sniffing around our borders. Testing.\"\n\n\"Testing for what?\"\n\nI don't answer that. Don't tell her about the patterns I've been noticing. She's got enough to worry about.\n\n\"You're doing that thing,\" she says against my shoulder.\n\n\"What thing?\"\n\n\"That thing where you go quiet because you think I can't handle the truth.\"\n\nSix years and she reads me like one of her garden almanacs.\n\n\"The *truth* is,\" I say carefully, \"twelve goblins in a mine is nothing. The truth is I've cleared three times that many from tighter spaces. The truth is—\"\n\n[Video]\n\n\"The truth is you're going alone.\" She pulls back, pins me with that drowning-deep stare. \"Again.\"\n\n\"Someone has to stay and protect the town.\"\n\n\"From what? Mean old Mrs. Curdsworth and her attack chickens?\"\n\nThat makes me laugh. \"Those chickens *are* vicious.\"\n\nShe doesn't smile. \"Train more knights, Aldric. Like you used to. Before you decided you had to do everything yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't do everything—\"\n\n\"Name the last threat you let the guard handle.\"\n\nI open my mouth. Close it. She's got me there.\n\n\"See?\" She stands, starts clearing plates with sharp, efficient movements. \"The great Aldric. Has to bear every burden. Fight every fight. Because gods forbid someone else might—\"\n\n\"Might die.\" The words come out harder than intended. \"Might die because I wasn't there. Because I let them go instead.\"\n\nThe plate in her hand stills. \"Oh, love.\"\n\n\"Goblins go for the eyes first,\" I tell her. \"Then the throat. Then they drag you down and let the little ones practice their knife work while you're still breathing. I've seen it. I've seen what happens when good men underestimate them.\"\n\nShe sets down the plate, comes back to me. Her hands frame my face. \"And you've seen what happens when you try to carry the world alone. You come home bleeding. Every time, a little more of you doesn't come back.\"\n\nHer being right doesn't change what needs doing.\n\n\"After the mine,\" I promise. \"After I clear it, I'll talk to Giles about training. Maybe take on a few of the younger guards. Teach them what to watch for.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Really.\" I kiss her palm. \"But today, I make sure those green bastards remember why they stay in the wastes.\"\n\nShe sighs but nods. \"At least eat more first. You burned a lot of energy this morning.\"\n\n\"Whose fault is that?\"\n\n\"Yours.\" She turns back to the stove, and yes, she's absolutely making sure I see how my tunic rides up. \"You're the one who married me.\"\n\n\"Best mistake I ever made.\"\n\n\"Mistake?\" She spins, brandishing a wooden spoon like Whisperwind.\n\n\"Best decision. Best blessing. Best—\"\n\n\"Better.\" She points the spoon at my plate. \"Now eat. Heroes don't fight on empty stomachs.\"\"Actually could be tricky.\" I drag my thumb along the table's grain, thinking. \"Scout reports say they've fortified. Barricades. Maybe even crude traps.\"\n\nElara pauses mid-pour, honey dripping from the pot. \"Fortified? Since when do Goblins fortify?\"\n\n\"Since about three months ago.\" I keep my voice level. No need to worry her with speculation. \"Started seeing it out near the border settlements.\"\n\n\"That's... not normal goblin behavior.\"\n\n\"No.\" I tear off a chunk of bread, use it to soak up the bacon grease. \"It's not.\"\n\nShe abandons the honey entirely, sits across from me. \"Aldric. What aren't you telling me?\"\n\n\"Nothing confirmed.\" But I can see she won't let this go. \"Someone's teaching them. Or something. The patterns are too deliberate. Too...\" I search for the word. \"Human.\"\n\n\"Human?\" Her voice pitches higher. \"You think someone's helping them?\"\n\n\"I think someone's using them.\" Big difference. \"Goblins are tools. Always have been. The question is who's wielding them now.\"\n\nShe reaches across the table, grips my hand. \"Then you definitely shouldn't go alone. If they're organized—\"\n\n\"If they're organized, they're still goblins.\" I turn her hand over, trace the calluses from her garden work. Strong hands. \"Fire still makes them scatter. Wind still throws off their aim. And Whisperwind still cuts through them like parchment.\"\n\n\"But if there's someone behind them—\"\n\n\"Then I'll find out who.\" I squeeze her fingers. \"That's my purpose. I track. I hunt. I end things.\"\n\n\"You make it sound so simple.\"\n\n\"It is simple. Just not easy.\"\n\nShe pulls her hand back, stands abruptly. \"Giles could help. He offered yesterday.\"\n\n\"Giles is a good soldier. But soldiers make noise. Soldiers follow patterns.\" I watch her pace, nervous energy crackling off her. \"I need to be smoke today. Silent. Unpredictable.\"\n\n[Video]\n\n\"You need to be careful.\"\n\n\"I'm always—\"\n\n\"Don't.\" She whirls on me. \"Don't say you're always careful. Not when you came home last month with troll poison in your veins. Not when you—\"\n\n\"That was different.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"That was a troll. This is goblins.\"\n\n\"Organized goblins! Fortified goblins! Goblins with a puppet master!\"\n\nShe's spiraling. I stand, catch her shoulders. \"Elara. Look at me.\"\n\nThose sapphire eyes are bright with unshed tears. Shit.\n\n\"I've been fighting goblins since I was fourteen,\" I tell her. \"My first kill was a goblin. My first scar—\" I guide her hand to the pale line on my ribs, \"—was a goblin. I know them. Know how they think, how they move, how they smell when they're afraid.\"\n\n\"But—\"\n\n\"And they know me.\" I let that sink in. \"The ones who survive? They tell stories. About the human who brings wind and fire. Who moves through shadows. Who leaves no survivors when they threaten what's his.\"\n\nHer breath shudders out. \"You're trying to scare me.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to be honest. You wanted honest.\"\n\n\"I wanted reassuring!\"\n\n\"Then be reassured.\" I pull her close, feel her heart racing against mine. \"Twelve goblins in a mine, organized or not, are still just twelve goblins. I've faced worse with less. And I always—always—come home to you.\"\n\nShe makes a sound that's half laugh, half sob. \"You better. We're trying for a baby, remember? Can't do that if you're dead.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't dream of it.\" I kiss the top of her head. \"Besides, who'd eat all your honey cakes?\"\n\n\"Giles, probably.\"\n\n\"Over my dead body.\"\n\n\"That's what I'm trying to avoid!\" But she's smiling now, crisis passed. \"Fine. Go. Be the hero. But if you're not back by sunset—\"\n\n\"You'll come looking. I know.\" I give her ass a quick pat as I head for the stairs. \"Keep that tunic on. I want to peel it off you when I get back.\"\n\n\"Presumptuous.\"\n\n\"Confident.\"\n\n\"Same thing with you!\" she calls after me.\n\nShe's not wrong.\"Remember that green bastard from our wedding?\" I wave my honey cake for emphasis. \"His cousins showed up.\"\n\nElara's eyes narrow. \"Aldric.\"\n\n\"He was very rude. Didn't even bring a gift.\"\n\n\"There were no Goblins at our wedding.\" She's trying not to smile. Failing.\n\n\"They do love parties though. All that screaming and chaos—\"\n\nThe wooden spoon hits my shoulder.\n\nI catch her wrist, pull her onto my lap. \"I'm seriously going to kill some goblins.\"\n\n\"You're seriously impossible.\" But she's melting against me, can't help it. We fit together like Whisperwind in her sheath.\n\n\"Here's serious.\" I kiss her neck, that spot that makes her shiver. \"They're dug into the Ironrock. Got there three nights ago. Probably found the old overseer's office, think they're clever.\"\n\n\"And?\" Her fingers find my hair.\n\n\"And they're about to learn what happens when goblins get too close to what's mine.\" Another kiss, just below her ear. \"The mine. The town.\" Kiss. \"You.\"\n\n\"You can't just—mmm—distract me with—\"\n\n\"Watch me.\" I stand, lifting her with me. She squeaks, wraps her legs around my waist. \"I've been killing goblins since before Eon's beard went gray.\"\n\n\"Your confidence is going to get you killed.\"\n\n\"My confidence got me you.\"\n\nShe pulls back, studies my face. Those eyes—winter-lake blue, fathoms deep—see everything. The jokes. The bravado. The cold certainty underneath. \"Burn them all.\"\n\n\"Every last one.\"\n\n\"Good.\" She kisses me, fierce and quick. \"Now put me down. Heroes don't fight on empty stomachs, and you've barely touched your bacon.\"\n\n\"I've been touching something better.\"\n\n\"Eat your breakfast, you *beast!*\"\n\nWhisperwind waits on her stand like a patient lover. The morning light through our bedroom window makes her shimmer—the color of lightning frozen mid-strike. I lift her, feel her weight settle into my palm like a handshake. Always true.\n\nThe enchantments hum against my skin. Something dreams inside the blade—Whisperwind's alive in her way. Waiting. Eager.\n\n[Image: Hello, beautiful. Ready to dance?\n\n\"Miss me?\" I murmur, checking her edge. Still sharp enough to split sunlight. The wind runes along her fuller pulse faintly, responding to my touch.\n\nMy armor takes longer. Elara helps with the buckles I can't reach, her fingers steady and practiced. Six years of this routine. Six years of sending me off to danger.\n\n\"Too tight?\" she asks, adjusting the pauldron.\n\n\"Perfect.\"\n\nShe always asks. I always say perfect. It's our ritual, important as any prayer to the Ephemerals.\n\n[Image: From husband to hero in twenty pounds of steel.\nThe breastplate goes on last. Mythril-touched steel, worth more than our house. Worth it, though.

Sees me coming, straightens. \"Aldric. Heard about the mine.\"\n\n\"Rumor has legs.\"\n\n\"So do goblins.\" He eyes Whisperwind. \"Need anything? Got new whetstones from the capital. Some decent torch oil.\"\n\n\"I'm good, Eadric.\"\n\n\"Course you are.\" He turns back to his cart, then pauses. \"My daughter wants to know if you'll teach her swordwork.\"\n\n\"After I clear the mine, we'll talk.\"\n\nHis relief's visible. \"Appreciated.\"\n\nThe kids find me at the fountain. Seven of them today, wooden swords and pot-lid shields, playing at heroes.\n\n\"Aldric! Aldric!\" Little Sara, gap-toothed and fierce. \"You gonna fight monsters?\"\n\n\"Just goblins.\"\n\n\"Goblins ARE monsters!\" This from Tom, who's decided he's my second-in-command. \"My da says they eat babies!\"\n\n\"Your da's trying to scare you into bed on time.\"\n\n\"Are not!\"\n\n\"Are too!\"\n\nI let them squabble, but I'm watching the shadows. Watching how the morning light falls. Calculating angles, distances. These kids don't know how close the darkness really is. Don't know what waits past their walls.\n\nGood. Let them play at heroes a little longer.\n\n\"Aldric's gonna win,\" Sara declares. \"He always wins. That's why he's The Great!\"\n\n\"Nobody always wins,\" I tell her, serious now. \"But I always try.\"\n\n\"That's the same thing!\"\n\nIf only.\n\n[Choice: Speak with the mayor.",

Probably came straight from his morning ledgers. \"Thank the Ephemerals you're here.\"\n\n\"Mayor.\" I adjust Whisperwind's weight at my side. The guards at the gate give us space, but they're listening.\n\n\"The situation at Ironrock—\" He mops his forehead with a silk kerchief that costs more than most miners see in a month. \"We've had to halt all operations. That's three days of ore we're not pulling. The smelters are sitting idle. The whole supply chain to the capital...\"\n\nThe driver, old Henrik's boy, tips his cap to me. I nod back. Kid lost two fingers to a wyvern last harvest—still drives better than his father.\n\n\"How many men did you lose?\" I ask.\n\n\"None dead, Flux be praised. But seven injured in the retreat. They say the goblins have built *something* down there. Barricades. Maybe worse.\" His jowls quiver with each word. \"The miners, they're talking about... structures. Old stonework they broke through last week.\"\n\nMy spine straightens. \"Stonework?\"\n\n\"Old things. Carvings. The kind the scholars in Thuulk pay gold for.\" He drops his voice.\n\nA kid kicks a leather ball past us, chasing chickens.\n\n\"The goblins found it first?\"\n\n\"Seems so. Moved right in once our boys broke through.\" Bramble pulls a scroll from his vest. \"The mine foreman drew this. What they could see before they ran.\"\n\nI study the rough sketch. Pillars. Arched doorways too tall for dwarves, too ornate for early human work. My jaw tightens.\n\n\"I'll clear them out,\" I tell him. \"Send the miners back tomorrow morning with a double guard shift.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow? Aldric, there could be dozens—\"\n\n\"There aren't.\" I hand back the scroll. \"Dozen, maybe fifteen at most. Goblins can't think past their next meal. They find a hole, they squat in it until someone makes them leave.\"\n\n[Image: Bramble's built like a baker's mistake—too much dough, not enough time in the oven.\n\nMrs. Fletcher waddles up, her arms full of fresh bread. \"Morning, Mayor.

My wife—\"\n\n\"That lovely Elara made you breakfast, did she?\" Her eyes twinkle. \"Good. Girl knows how to keep a man's strength up. When are you two giving us some little warriors to run around town?\"\n\nThe mayor coughs. \"Mrs. Fletcher, perhaps—\"\n\n\"We're working on it,\" I say, which makes her cackle and waddle off.\n\nBramble watches her go, then turns back to me. \"The iron shipments to the capital are already two days behind. The guild representatives are breathing down my neck. If this isn't resolved—\"\n\n\"It will be.\"\n\n\"You're certain you don't need support? Captain Giles has volunteers—\"\n\n\"Giles is a good man and a good fighter.\" I check my pouches—sulfur, salt, the usual implements. \"Goblins in a mine need fire and wind to keep things clean. It will be close quarters. Can't have a bunch of guards getting in each other's way.\"\n\nHe nods, but his face says he's calculating lost revenue by the hour. \"The structures they found—you'll send word about what's down there?\"\n\n\"After I burn out the goblins.\"\n\n\"Of course. Of course.\" He's already backing away, eager to return to his numbers and ledgers. \"The town's counting on you, Aldric. As always.\"\n\n\"As always.\"\n\nHe hurries off, probably to threaten the mining guild with penalties if they don't resume operations tomorrow. I head for the gate. The guards straighten as I pass.\n\n\"Send them to the Hollow, Aldric,\" one mutters.\n\n[Choice: Journey to Ironrock Mine.",

The forest here grows thick—old growth that remembers when goblins were just bad dreams told to children.\n\nThree miners trudge toward me, pulling a handcart loaded with personal effects. Walking with the slow certainty of men who'd seen enough.\n\n\"Morning, Aldric.\" The lead miner, Henrik's cousin by his jaw, doesn't quite meet my eyes. \"Figured we'd see you coming.\"\n\n\"How many?\" I ask.\n\n\"Can't say for certain.\" He spits tobacco juice into the ferns. \"Enough. They came up through the new shaft we broke last sennight. The one with the old stonework.\"\n\n\"Anyone hurt?\"\n\n\"Not our team. Bruises. Pride, mostly. We locked the upper galleries and got out clean.\" He shifts the cart handles. \"They're... settling in. Like they plan to stay.\"\n\nI nod. \"Mine'll be clear by sunset. Tell Bramble to send the next shift at dawn.\"\n\nThey continue west. I continue east. The forest knows what's coming—birds gone quiet, even the insects holding their breath.\n\nFresh wheel ruts cut deep in mud. Someone left in a hurry—probably with a full load, too.\n\nThen I smell it.\n\nGoblin stench hits like a wall. Unwashed bodies layered over something worse—the musk of things that rut in darkness and eat their own dead. My gorge rises. I breathe through my mouth, but that's worse. Now I can taste it.\n\nThe path opens into the mine's staging area. Abandoned equipment everywhere—pickaxes dropped mid-swing, lunch pails still steaming, a card game interrupted, copper coins scattered across a crate. They didn't run. They just... left. Orderly. Like they knew exactly what not to fight.\n\nDark stains on the ground near the entrance. Goblin marking fluid—acrid, territorial. They're claiming territory. My jaw clenches thinking of what that means. In the frontier villages, girls disappear. Not killed—worse. Kept. Bred. Some get rescued sennights later, hollow-eyed and babbling. Some get found years later with broods of green-skinned spawn, too far gone to even remember their own names.\n\nNot here. Not in my territory.\n\nThe entrance yawns before me. Fresh goblin tracks in the mud—clawed feet, some dragging weapons, one set dragging something heavier.\n\nMy hand closes on Whisperwind's grip. The blade hums, eager. Good. Because behind that stench, beneath the musk and territorial pissing—stone dust. Old stone dust. Whatever the miners broke through last week, the goblins found it first.\n\nThey'll have numbers, knowledge of the tunnels, maybe crude traps. They'll fight dirty—groin strikes, eye gouging, tried to hamstring. They always do.\n\nI crack my neck. Flex my fingers. The killing-calm settles over me like old armor. Heartbeat slows. Breathing deepens.\n\nTime to remind them why goblins used to hide from men.",

      "text": "The darkness swallows me whole.\n\nMine air lands heavy in the chest—thick, wet, with weight behind it. My eyes adjust slow. The entrance tunnel slopes down, support beams every ten feet. Some are cracked. Some are missing. The floor's uneven where cart tracks cut grooves decades deep.\n\nWhisperwind slides from her sheath. The faint scrape of steel on leather sounds loud as thunder down here. I keep the blade low, ready for the upward cut that opens goblin throats.\n\nRight hand on the wall. Always keep contact in the dark. The stone sweats—groundwater seeping through limestone. My fingers trace tool marks, then something else. Scratches. Fresh. Goblin claws marking territory like dogs pissing on posts.\n\nI test each plank before trusting my weight. Second rule of mine fighting: the ground lies. Goblins love pit traps, love watching men fall onto stakes smeared with their shit. The wood groans but holds.\n\nDeeper now. The stench thickens—unwashed bodies, rotting meat, and underneath it all, that sweet-sick musk. My stomach clenches.\n\nThere—a broken helmet in the muck. Not dropped. Crushed. Tooth marks punch through the iron like it's parchment. Whatever bit through this wasn't satisfied with just killing.\n\nThe tunnel branches ahead. I can hear them now—that chittering speech that sounds like someone choking on their own tongue. At least three voices. Maybe five. They're not trying to hide. Why would they? This is their domain now.\n\nI drop to one knee, scoop a handful of pebbles. Whisper the word that wakes wind.\n\n\"Ventusfury.\"\n\nJust a breath of magic, enough to carry the pebbles' rattle down the left passage. The chittering stops.\n\nGood.\n\nThe main passage opens into a wider chamber ahead. I can make out their shapes—three goblins arranged in a loose picket line. The other two have rusty mining picks, probably pulled from dead men's hands. They're focused on the side passage where my pebbles landed.\n\nThe dance begins.\n\n]Magic. Scholars view it as a conversation; I view it as a truncheon. Application trumps raw power. A wizard might level this whole hillside, certainly—and bury us all in a thousand tons of rock. I use magic the way a butcher uses a boning knife: seeking the joint, severing the connection, wasting nothing.\n\nThe hedge wizard who taught me—Gannis, dying of gut-rot in a ditch outside Westmarch—he grabbed my wrist when I gave him water. \"Not... charity,\" he'd gasped through blood-foam. \"Payment.\"\n\nThree days I sat with him while he died. Three days he poured the Telenil battle-tongue into my skull. The war words. The cuts and thrusts of combat casting.\n\n\"Shape... matters more than... than power,\" Gannis had wheezed, his fingers forcing mine into the proper forms. \"The Telenil know... thousand years of... of killing with grace.\"\n\nVentusfury. Wind as weapon, scout, and voice.\n\nGlacieshold. Ice-grip. But deeper: the moment water chooses sides, becomes wall or trap or death.\n\nIgnisurge. The difference between light and cremation.\n\nAny fool can say the words. The hand-shapes, the breath-timing, the intent behind the gesture—that's what makes fire obey.\n\n[Image: Ventusfury in its smallest form, a mouse's breath of wind.\n\nI pause at the first support beam. Thumb and forefinger snap—barely a sound. It tells me everything: air flows toward me along the floor (they've got fire deeper in), away from me at head height (gas pocket forming). Sweet-rot smell like overripe pears—firedamp. One spark up there and we all cook.\n\nMy left hand forms the ice-ready position: three fingers curved like holding a river stone. The mine's moisture beads on my palm, ready to become whatever I need. Two frozen coins already pressed to my belt—door seals if needed. The cold helps me think.\n\nAhead, water drips. But the rhythm's wrong. Too regular.\n\nDrip. Drip. Drip-drip.\n\nAnother micro-pulse of wind, directed left into a side passage. It comes back tasting of leather and goblin piss. They're there, waiting.\n\nI roll my shoulders, feel Whisperwind's weight shift. The blade's quiet—it knows this is spell-work first. My right hand practices the Ignisurge forms: thumb-spark for precision, two-finger lance for cutting. Gannis made me drill these until my fingers bled, to distract himself from his own pain.\n\n\"The Telenil,\" he'd said on his last day, \"they see magic as... as conversation. You're not commanding—you're... convincing. Fire wants to burn. Ice wants to still. Wind wants to move. You just... suggest directions.\"\n\nThe tunnel splits ahead. Both passages dark, but the darkness has different qualities. Left is thick—bodies and barriers. Right is thin—open space but angled wrong.\n\nI palm one ice coin. The moisture in the air crystallizes along my knuckles, eager. Ready.\n\nSomething shifts in the left passage. Metal on leather.\n\nMy boot lands on a dry patch in the tunnel floor. Too dry. Everything else is seeping moisture, but this one square yard is bone-dry.\n\nI sidestep, pressing against the wet wall. Another wind-pulse, this one carrying a pebble's sound to that dry spot.\n\n*Thwick.* A sling stone cracks where I should have been standing. Behind a slotted screen twenty feet ahead, someone curses in goblin—sounds like \"Grashk.\"\n\nBlood-debt comes due.\n\nThe rime spreads from my palm across the tunnel floor—invisible in the dark, thin as paper, cold enough to seize. If they rush, they'll hit it like a wall. My left hand maintains that while my right forms the spark position.\n\nGannis's last words bubble up from memory: \"Magic isn't... isn't strength. It's knowing. Know what burns. What freezes. What moves. Then... then you just... help it along.\"\n\nNo risk at hand-height. The gas floats. I let it fly.\n\nThe slat screen explodes in light. A goblin squeals—night vision murdered. I taste copper and smoke, but controlled. Surgical. Something deeper in the mine drums once.\n\nThey know I'm here. They know I'm hunting.\n\nGood.",

I slide beneath it, spine scraping wood, Whisperwind reversed in my grip.\n\nThe first goblin never sees me coming.\n\nMy pommel strikes the soft spot where skull meets spine. The crack is wet, muffled. He drops like a sack of grain. I catch him before he hits ground, lower him silent into the muck. His sling stones scatter—I palm three.\n\nThe second goblin starts to turn. I'm already moving.\n\nWhisperwind knows this dance. The blade shifts in my hand—a living thing that remembers every fight we've shared. I bring her up in a reversed grip, the false edge finding the sweet spot under his jaw. The cut is clean, surgical. He tries to scream but I've already opened his windpipe. Just a wheeze and he's down, drowning in his own blood.\n\nThe third one sees his partner fall.\n\n\"Ventusfury,\" I breathe.\n\nThe slinger's raising his weapon. My wind pushes his elbow just as he releases—the stone meant for my skull cracks into the ceiling instead. He's fumbling for another stone when Whisperwind's point catches his heart.\n\nThree heartbeats. Three corpses.\n\nI wipe the blade clean on the slinger's rags. That's when I see them—human eyes threaded on gut-string like a necklace. Still wet. Still warm. The irises are blue.\n\nDeeper in, I hear shuffling. Careful movement. They know something's wrong but not what.\n\nLet the wondering gnaw them hollow.\n\nThe tunnel narrows ahead, then opens into what must have been the overseer's station. I can see lamplight bleeding around a doorframe. They're falling back, trying to fortify.\n\n[Choice: Advance on the barricaded office.]The ore wedge sits loose against the wall—a triangular chunk of iron meant to split rock. My boot sends it clattering loud as thunder.\n\nAll three goblins turn toward the sound.\n\nI'm already moving the opposite direction. Three long strides right, making sure my boots ring against stone. The slinger tracks the sound, arm drawing back. The two with picks start forward.\n\nThen I cut left, hard.\n\nWhisperwind sings—that sweet metallic note that means death is coming. The blade catches what little light exists down here, becomes a silver arc in the darkness.\n\n\"Ignisurge!\"\n\nFire blooms from my left hand—a blinding flash, nothing more. Brilliant orange light explodes across their night-adapted eyes. They shriek, hands flying to their faces.\n\nWhisperwind takes the first goblin at the knees—parts flesh like water, skyforged edge through bone like bread. He topples. My return stroke opens his throat before he hits the ground.\n\nThe second swings wild. I step inside the arc, shoulder into his chest, pommel into his nose. Spin the blade. His guts hit the floor before he understands he's dead.\n\nThe slinger blinks, loads a stone. I throw the gutted corpse at him. It hits him square and I'm already lunging, Whisperwind threading his ribs, leaning on the blade until I feel it scrape against his heart. His eyes go wide, then empty.\n\nI pull the blade free. Around the slinger's neck—a necklace of human eyes on gut-string. Still glistening. Irises blue as summer sky.\n\nThe sound of my attack echoes deep into the mine. Chittering voices rise in alarm. Feet slapping on wet stone—lots of feet, moving fast. They're retreating deeper, toward the lower galleries.\n\n[Choice: Pursue them into the depths.]The pebble arcs through the darkness. As it flies, I whisper: \"Ventusfury.\"\n\nWind carries the stone further than any throw should, bouncing it off the far wall with a crack that echoes like a whip. Two goblins immediately peel off, picks raised, chittering excitedly as they investigate.\n\nPerfect.\n\n\"Glacieshold.\"\n\nIce spreads from my palm, racing across the floor in a thin sheet. It pools around the ankles of the remaining goblin and the slinger, freezing their feet to the stone. They shriek, trying to pull free.\n\nThe two investigating goblins hear their panic, start to turn back.\n\nToo late.\n\nWhisperwind slides free with the sound of a lover's sigh. The blade knows my intent before I do—already shifting its weight for the work ahead. I move like fever through blood, like grief through a widow's house.\n\nThe first goblin rounds the corner into my thrust. Whisperwind takes him through the eye, the tip punching out the back of his skull with a wet crack. I don't even slow—just let his momentum carry him off the blade as I pivot toward his partner.\n\nThis one manages to raise his pick. I let him.\n\nThe pick comes down. Whisperwind rises to meet it. The weapons clash—crude iron against skyforged steel—and the pick shatters like glass. Metal fragments pepper his face. While he's screaming, I open him from groin to throat with a rising cut that parts flesh like silk.\n\nBack to the frozen ones.\n\nThe slinger's managed to load a stone despite his trapped feet. He releases. I don't dodge—I *flow* around it, Whisperwind's flat redirecting the projectile into the wall. The blade continues its arc, taking his hand at the wrist. The hand hits the ground still clutching the sling.\n\nThe last goblin's torn his feet free, leaving skin behind on the ice. He hobbles toward a side passage, mewling.\n\nWhisperwind's point finds his spine. He drops, paralyzed but breathing. I step over him, following his terrified gaze.\n\nThere—strung between two posts like a grotesque banner—a necklace of human eyes threaded on gut-string. Still wet. Still warm. The irises are blue.\n\nBehind me, the paralyzed goblin whimpers. I finish him quick—he doesn't deserve quick, but I need to move. More voices echo from below. They're retreating, but organized. Controlled.\n\n[Choice: Pursue them into the depths.]The corridor ahead bends left. A cluster of goblins wait—I can smell them.\n\nTime to teach them about ice.\n\nGlacieshold.\n\nThe word flows through my fingers as I shape the spell. Ice spreads from my palm across the tunnel floor—not flat, but sloped. A clean V-shape, walls to center, funneling toward the doorway ahead. I leave a raised ridge down the middle. Their feet will slide sideways into the trap.\n\nI tap Whisperwind's pommel against the left wall. The sound echoes.\n\n\"Grashk! There!\" A goblin voice, excited. Young. Stupid.\n\nThe slinger steps into view—green skin glistening with sweat, yellow eyes wide, erection tenting his loincloth because violence always gets them hard. He draws back his sling.\n\nIgnisurge.\n\nMy fingers snap forward. A line of pure heat cuts the air, visible for just a heartbeat—bright as lightning, thin as wire. The sling cord parts mid-swing. The stone drops. The goblin stares at his useless weapon.\n\n\"KILL HIM!\" Two more goblins charge around the corner, feet hitting my ice.\n\nBeautiful.\n\nThey slide immediately, arms windmilling. The V-shape does its work—both skid inward toward the center ridge. One trips. The other stumbles over him. They're tangled, cursing, trying to stand on ice that won't let them.\n\nGlacieshold.\n\nThis time I'm specific. Ice forms around their ankles—thick, instant, permanent. They're welded to my trap.\n\n\"Magic!\" one screams. \"He's using—\"\n\nIgnisurge.\n\nA thumb-flick sends a spark into the slinger's eyes. He shrieks, pawing at his face. Behind him, two more goblins appear. One's carrying an oil pot.\n\nThe fear hits them now. That beautiful moment when they realize they're not fighting some lucky human—they're fighting someone who turns combat into art.\n\nThe oil-carrier panics, hurls his pot.\n\nGlacieshold.\n\nIce springs from my forearm—a shield, paper-thin but harder than steel. The oil splashes against it.\n\nVentusfury.\n\nWind shoves the oil back along the ice floor, under their feet.\n\nIgnisurge.\n\nA tiny spark. The oil ignites behind them, cutting off retreat. They're mine now.\n\nI stride forward down the center ridge, balanced while they slip and scramble. The ankle-frozen goblins try to swing at me. I'm already past them. My boot crushes the first one's knee sideways. The crack echoes. My elbow catches the second's jaw—teeth scatter across ice like dice.\n\nThe slinger's still blind, sobbing. A head-butt drops him.\n\nThe remaining two goblins jam in the doorway, trying to flee the flames behind them.\n\nPerfect.\n\n]The tunnel opens up. Six—no, eight goblins. Green skin glistening with mine-damp, wearing scraps of leather and stolen mail. The nearest one grins, showing teeth filed to points.\n\nThey think numbers matter.\n\nIgnisurge.\n\nFire blooms from my palm, a wave of orange death that rolls forward at waist height. The front two goblins shriek as their leather burns through, flesh blistering instantly. They drop their rusted blades, stumbling back into their brothers.\n\nI step through the gap I've made.\n\nA goblin lunges from my left. My shoulder, plated in steel, catches him in the teeth. Bone cracks. As he staggers, I pivot, bringing my right hand around in an arc. Fire follows the motion, a burning whip that catches three of them across their bellies. The smell of charred meat fills the tunnel.\n\nThey're screaming now.\n\nAt the back, one goblin clutches a clay jar—oil, by the way he holds it like a baby. His yellow eyes are wide, measuring the killing-space between us. Another has a sling, stone already whirring.\n\nThe stone clips my cheek. Too close.\n\nI drop to one knee, left palm snapping forward. A fist-sized fireball punches through a wooden shield, exploding behind it. The goblin holding it falls backward, chest smoking. The others freeze for a heartbeat—that beautiful moment when bravado becomes terror.\n\nThe oil-carrier's hands shake. His cock has shriveled back into his loincloth. Fear does that.",

They're building a barricade, but they're also preparing something else. The smell of lamp oil cuts through the usual goblin stench.\n\nThe office overlooks the main shaft through a narrow window. Smart defensive position—if I hadn't fought in a hundred rat's nests just like it.\n\nThey've stacked desks against the door. Through the gap beneath, I see shadows moving. Four, maybe five. Two near the back are doing something with clay jugs. Oil bombs.\n\nTypical goblin tactics—when you can't win clean, burn everything.\n\nThe door won't budge. They've braced it well.[Video]\n\n\"Ventusfury!\"\n\nI don't whisper it this time. I roar it.\n\nWind explodes from my palms—a hammering gale that hits the door like a giant's fist. The wood splinters. Iron bands buckle. The entire frame tears free from the stone, crashing outward and bringing the desk-barricade with it.\n\nI'm through before the dust settles.\n\nThe room's smaller than expected—fifteen feet square, ceiling sagging with timber rot. An oil lamp swings from a chain, casting wild shadows. Two goblins with jugs of oil stand frozen by the back wall. Three others scramble over the destroyed furniture, reaching for weapons.\n\nWhisperwind takes the first one across the eyes. The blade moves like thought—no hesitation between decision and action. Blood sprays across yellowed invoices still tacked to the wall.\n\nI let him swing. At the last second, I step inside his reach, catch his wrist with my free hand. My knee drives into his elbow—the joint bends backward with a crack like breaking kindling. While he screams, Whisperwind opens his throat.\n\nThe oil-throwers are recovering. One's got a burning rag ready.\n\n\"Glacieshold!\"\n\nIce erupts across the floor, racing up their legs, freezing the oil in their jugs solid. The one with the burning rag drops it in panic. The flame hits the ice, sputters out.\n\nThe remaining two goblins charge together, mining picks raised. Smart—coordinated attacks are harder to counter.\n\nWhisperwind flows through the Seventh Form—an extension of arm, rage, and thirty years of killing. Deflect, redirect, riposte. Their picks spark against skyforged steel. One goblin's momentum carries him past me. Whisperwind's edge bites through his hamstring. He falls, screaming.\n\nThe last one backs against the wall, pick trembling in his grip.\n\nI advance slow. Let him see death coming.\n\nHe drops the pick, falls to his knees, chittering what might be prayers or pleas. Doesn't matter. My boot crushes his windpipe.\n\nThe room goes quiet except for the hamstrung goblin's whimpering. I scan the space—mining charts, duty rosters, payroll ledgers. And there, nailed to the wall with a pick through the center: the accident report log. The page is turned to last sennight. \"Breakthrough into older workings. Three injuries. Unstable ground.\"\n\nBelow it, written in what looks like blood: \"OURS NOW.\"\n\nI finish the hamstrung goblin. The silence feels heavy, wrong. Through the window overlooking the main shaft, I see torchlight moving far below. Lots of torches. They're massing at the bottom, near the new breakthrough.[[Image: Seepwater pools in natural karst pockets; violet cave-caps fatten on bat guano and iron drip.\nThe goblins know these tunnels now—every twist, every dead end.\n\nThey're not running scared. They're leading me somewhere.\n\nThe passage opens into a natural cavern, ceiling lost in darkness. Water drips steady, has for centuries, forming pools that swallow my torchlight and give back only my face, distorted. The air tastes wrong—thick, sporous, makes my throat itch.\n\nWhite mushrooms carpet the far wall, each one the size of a dinner plate. Some pulse with internal light. The pools between me and them are still as glass, maybe ankle deep, maybe bottomless.\n\nI see them now—five goblins crouched on the far side where the floor rises again. They're not attacking. They're waiting. One grins, showing filed teeth.\n\nI step toward the water.\n\nThe instant my boot touches the pool's edge, the mushrooms explode.\n\nSpores fill the air—a white cloud that burns my eyes, my lungs. I stagger back, coughing. Through tears, I see the goblins moving, spreading out to flank. They knew exactly where I'd step, exactly when the spores would burst.\n\n\"Ventusfury!\"\n\nWind tears through the cavern, but careful—too strong and I'll spread the spores everywhere. Just enough to create a clear channel of air. I pull my shirt over my mouth, breathe shallow.\n\nThey're coming through the water now, picks raised. The leader's halfway across when I spot it—a miner's lamp still burning beneath the surface, its light wavering through two inches of crystal-clear water. A warning. Or bait.\n\nHe's been hiding underwater, breathing through a reed. His pick swings for my knee. I pivot, bring Whisperwind down in a silver arc. The blade cleaves through his skull, splits him to the teeth. Gore splashes into the pool, turning the water pink.\n\nTwo more rush from the left. My boots slip on the slick stone—exactly what they planned. I go down on one knee, Whisperwind coming up in a desperate parry. Their picks spark against the blade. One overextends—I grab his ankle, yank him into the water. He goes under thrashing.\n\nBack on my feet. The remaining goblins circle, careful now. They've seen what Whisperwind can do. One feints left. I don't take the bait. Another throws a handful of mushroom paste—it splashes across my chest, burns through my shirt like acid.\n\nPain sharpens everything.\n\n\"Ignisurge!\"\n\nFire blooms in my palm. Not at them—at the water. Steam explodes upward, boiling the goblin I pulled under. His screams bubble up through the water. The steam also clears the spores, gives me room to breathe.\n\nThe last three charge together.\n\nWhisperwind moves in the Ninth Form—the Reaping Wind. The blade becomes a silver blur, impossible to track. I take the first goblin's arm at the elbow. The second loses his head—it rolls into the pool with a splash. The third tries to run.\n\nI let Whisperwind fly.\n\nThe blade spins through the air, guided by wind and will. It takes him between the shoulders, punches through his chest. He falls face-first into the shallow water, green blood spreading like oil.\n\nI retrieve my sword, scan the cavern. No more movement. But on the far wall, carved in the stone beneath the mushroom grove: arrows pointing down, and below them, that same phrase in blood: \"OURS NOW.\"\n\nThe passage continues, sloping sharper. I can hear drums now—deep, rhythmic. They know I'm coming.]Ventusfury.\n\nI reverse the wind. The burning oil I'd pushed away now surges forward, riding my ice like a flaming wave. It washes up their legs, soaking into their rags.\n\nIgnisurge.\n\nOne spark at chest height.\n\nThey ignite like torches. Screaming, thrashing, trying to beat out flames that won't die. The doorway clears as they stumble backward into their friends. Fire spreads through the cluster—goblins are greasy creatures, they burn well.\n\nI keep my ice shield raised, wind pushing smoke away from me. The screaming stops after four heartbeats. The crackling continues longer.\n\nWhen it's done, I step through charred meat and melted fat. The smell would make a lesser man vomit. I've smelled worse.\n\nThe corridor opens into the main shaft—a circular pit with wooden platforms spiraling down. More goblins below, their drums suddenly silent. They've heard their brothers die.\n\nFear makes them stupid.]Glacieshold.\n\nIce drops like a guillotine blade behind the jammed goblins, sealing them into the doorway. They're pressed between their dead brothers and my frozen wall.\n\nIgnisurge.\n\nI draw two fingers across the air. The heat-lance burns tiny holes through the ice at eye level. The beams punch through—one goblin loses an eye, another his throat. They can't even fall, packed too tight.\n\nVentusfury.\n\nWind presses against the ice wall. It groans, cracks, surges forward. The goblins compress. Bones snap like kindling. The ice shatters sideways in bloody chunks, taking most of them with it.\n\nOne survivor crawls from the wreckage, dragging himself by his fingernails. I step on his spine. Crunch.\n\nThe corridor opens into the main shaft—a circular pit with wooden platforms spiraling down. More goblins below, watching me emerge from their dead brothers' tomb.\n\nThey've gone quiet. Smart ones are already backing toward the lower levels.]My boot scrapes the floor, deliberate. The oil-carrier flinches, jar sloshing. Perfect.\n\n\"Drop it,\" I tell him.\n\nHe doesn't. His grip tightens. Behind him, two others raise their blades—trying to find courage in fellowship. Adorable.\n\nI kick the floor. My steel boot strikes sparks. One spark is all I need.\n\nIgnisurge.\n\nA line of fire races across the stone toward them—controlled, precise, beautiful. The oil-carrier panics, tries to throw the jar. Too late. I'm already moving, two long strides and a leap off the tunnel wall. My armored knee catches the jar, driving it up under his chin.\n\nThe jar shatters. Oil sprays.\n\nMid-air, I twist, both hands spreading wide. Fire erupts from my palms—down and out, away from the beams, turning the oil mist into a rolling wave of flame that washes over the clustered goblins at knee height.\n\nThey scream. They burn. They fall.\n\nI land in a crouch among the dying. One still moves, crawling. A quick burst of flame to his back ends it. Another tries to run—fire licks his ankles, dropping him.\n\nThe tunnel behind me is clear. The tunnel ahead echoes with drums. They know I'm coming.\n\nGood.]The oil-carrier clutches his jar like salvation. I'll make it his funeral pyre.\n\nIgnisurge.\n\nFirst fireball—chest-high, quick as a curse. It hammers the lead goblin's shield, heat exploding along the stone wall. The shield drops, smoking. The goblin drops, screaming.\n\nWithout moving my feet, I scoop my left hand low. A second fireball rolls across the floor like a burning wheel, exploding at their shins. Two goblins dance backward, leather wrappings on fire.\n\nThe oil-carrier raises his jar, either to throw or drink—doesn't matter.\n\nThird fireball. Overhand, like skipping a stone. It cracks the jar at the neck. Oil fountains forward, away from the ceiling beams, directly into my next gesture.\n\nIgnisurge.\n\nFire streams from my palm, igniting the oil spray. The flame blooms outward in a tight cone, washing over the remaining goblins without touching timber. Controlled devastation. Surgical hellfire.\n\nThey're all screaming now. Some dropping, some running. One charges through the flame, blade raised, flesh already peeling. My plated fist meets his jaw. The blade clatters away as he falls.\n\nI step through them while they burn. Each footfall deliberate, unhurried. A goblin on his knees tries to grab my leg. I press my palm to his head—a brief touch of fire. He falls silent.\n\nThe last two back against the far wall, weapons forgotten. One pisses himself. The other whimpers something about 'Storak.'\n\nI raise my hand. They run.\n\nI snap my fingers three times. Each snap births a small flame that flies to the tunnel lanterns, lighting them in sequence. The space blooms orange and shadow. Any goblin watching from deeper in sees my silhouette framed in fire, stepping over their burning dead.[Choice: Continue to the main shaft.",

The stone down there is different—black, polished, carved with symbols that squirm when you stare too long. K'tarran. Has to be.\n\nA dozen goblins cluster around the breakthrough. One wears a headdress of human teeth and finger bones—their shaman. He's drumming on a shield, the rhythm matching something deeper, older. The stones themselves seem to pulse with it.\n\nBetween them and me: forty feet of vertical shaft and a half-lowered cage.\n\nTime to remind them why humans conquered this world.\n\nI grab the hoist rope, wrap it around my waist.

Five—\n\nI let go.\n\nLanding hard, I roll forward, come up with Whisperwind already moving. The blade takes the closest goblin across the belly.

They scatter, burning, screaming. The shaman tries to maintain his rhythm but his headdress catches fire. He drops the drum, rolling on the ground.\n\nI walk through the flames.\n\nToo fast.\n\nThe ice I laid—my own ice—has melted in rivulets where the fire washed across it. The stone beneath shines wet, black, treacherous. My boot finds the slick and for one terrible instant I am not Aldric the Great, hero of Eboncrest, slayer of wyverns and trolls. I am simply a body obeying gravity.\n\nMy ankle rolls. Not badly—I've fought through worse—but it costs me half a heartbeat. My weight shifts wrong. Whisperwind's arc falters mid-swing, her tip catching stone instead of goblin flesh, and the impact judders up through my wrist.\n\nThe goblin I meant to kill does not die.\n\nHe is small. Barely three feet, green as pond-scum, eyes like diseased egg-yolks. His pick is rusted iron that wouldn't cut cheese. He smells of piss and rotting meat and that sweet-sick musk that makes my stomach clench.\n\nHe does not swing at my chest or throat. A warrior would. A soldier would.\n\nHe swings at my knee.\n\nThe pick-point punches through the gap in my greave where the joint flexes. Not deep—barely an inch of corroded metal in the meat behind my kneecap—but the leg buckles. I go down on that knee, Whisperwind scraping sparks from stone, and the world narrows to a single point of white-hot wrongness where my body has been breached.\n\n\"GRASHK!\" The goblin screams it like triumph. \"GRASHK-THRACK! DOWN! DOWN!\"\n\nI bring Whisperwind around. The blade should take his head. Would have taken his head, if not for the second goblin—the one I thought I'd killed against the wall, skull cracked, done—who has crawled through his own blood to wrap both arms around my sword-wrist.\n\nHis grip is nothing. Weak as a child's. I could shake him off in an instant.\n\nBut an instant is what I do not have.\n\nThe pick comes down again. Same knee. Deeper. I hear the crunch of metal on bone, feel it as a sound more than a sensation, and then I am falling sideways because that leg no longer answers to my will.\n\n\"Ventus—\"\n\nA rock catches me across the temple—dropped by the burned goblin who has stopped rolling and started killing. The word dies in my throat. Wind magic requires breath and focus; I have neither. Stars burst behind my eyes, hot and white, and through them I see shapes converging.\n\nThree. No—four. The ones I burned are dead, truly dead, but I miscounted in my hubris. There were more in the shadows.\n\n\"Humie bleeds,\" one rasps.\n\nThey do not rush. They have learned, these goblins. Learned from watching their kind die, learned from the stories whispered around their dung-fires, learned that even a wounded hero can take lives if you give him room to swing.\n\nThey circle.\n\nI try to rise. My ruined knee screams and folds. I catch myself on one hand, Whisperwind still clutched in the other, and for a moment I am simply a man on all fours in a hole in the earth, bleeding onto stone that doesn't care.\n\n\"Fire-man,\" the shaman wheezes. He has crawled back from the archway, hand crushed, headdress gone, patches of his scalp showing pink and weeping where his hair burned away. But he is smiling. \"Fire-man got no fire now.\"\n\nHe's right.\n\nThe flame-casting drained me. The ice before it drained me further. I have enough left for one spell, maybe two, but not enough to clear the room. Not enough to kill four goblins and a shaman and make it back up that shaft and ride home to Elara.\n\nElara.\n\nThe thought of her face breaks something loose in my chest. I roar—formless, animal—and lunge at the nearest goblin. Whisperwind takes his arm off at the elbow. But my lunge becomes a fall, because you cannot lunge on a knee that is more hole than joint, and I go down hard on my shoulder and the impact tears Whisperwind from my grip.\n\nShe spins away across the wet stone. The skyforged blade that has drunk the blood of a hundred monsters comes to rest against the shaman's ruined hand.\n\nHe picks her up.\n\n\"Booyagh,\" he breathes, and his eyes go wide at the hum of wind-runes against his palm. \"Booyagh-sparkly.\"[Choice: They take their time...]\"Glacieshold!\"\n\nIce spreads beneath their feet.

Bones crack like twigs.\n\nHe looks up at me, eyes wild with pain and a terror that has nothing to do with me.\n\n\"Too late,\" he gasps in broken common tongue. \"Already... waking...\"\n\nWhisperwind through his eye ends his riddles.\n\nThe silence after slaughter always feels wrong. Blood steams on cold stone. The shaman's drum rolls to a stop against my boot.\n\nI kick it aside and study the breach.\n\nThe miners' picks punched through limestone into something else entirely.

They are scavengers, carrion-feeders, and they have learned across a thousand generations that thrashing prey injures scavengers. So they wait and let me bleed.\n\nThe shaman crouches just out of reach, Whisperwind laid across his knees like a trophy. He strokes her blade with his good hand, leaving smears of green-black blood on skyforged steel. \"Pretty,\" he murmurs. \"Pretty-sharp. Cut-cut-cut all the Grikzit boys.\"\n\n\"Grikzit,\" I repeat. The word comes out wrong, bubbled through something wet in my throat. \"That's your tribe.\"\n\n\"Grikzit strongest.\" He shows his teeth. They are filed to points, stained yellow-brown, and several are missing.\n\nI try to wipe it away. My arms don't want to cooperate. One of the goblins—I've stopped tracking which is which—has tied my wrists behind my back with a leather cord that might be human skin. The binding isn't tight. It doesn't need to be. I cannot rise.\n\n\"Twelve Grikzit this morning,\" the shaman continues. \"Twelve. Now four. Four and Grubnoz.\" He taps his chest. \"Grubnoz. Remember name, fire-man. Grubnoz the one who kills Aldric the Great.\"\n\n\"Grubnoz,\" I manage. \"Let's... negotiate.\"\n\nThe goblins cackle, high-pitched and wet, slapping their thighs with hands still crusted in their brothers' blood. One of them laughs so hard he falls over.\n\n\"Negotiate,\" Grubnoz repeats, savoring the word. \"Fire-man wants to negotiate. What fire-man got to trade? Shinies?\" He reaches down, fumbles at my belt, finds my purse. Empties it. The coins scatter across black stone, winking in the torchlight. \"Got these already.\"\n\n\"More,\" I say. \"My house. Eboncrest. I'm rich.\"\n\n\"Rich.\" Grubnoz tilts his head, considering. \"Rich in humie-town. Town with walls. Town with guards.\" He shakes his head sadly. \"Grubnoz not go to humie-town. Grubnoz stay here. Stay in dark. Safe in dark.\"\n\n\"Then what do you want?\"\n\nGrubnoz smiles. The expression transforms his face into something worse than hateful—something genuinely pleased.\n\n\"What Grubnoz want?\" He gestures at the carved archway behind him, the black stone that hums with frequencies that nest behind my eyes like wasps. \"Grubnoz want what sleeping here. Old god. Old power. Grikzit find it, dig it up, wake it up.\"\n\nHe stops. Looks down at me.\n\n\"Fire-man dying. Fire-man want to know—\" He leans close, close enough that I can smell the rot-sweet of his breath, see the mucus glistening in his nostrils. \"—what happen to fire-man before fire-man dies?\"\n\nThe cold is spreading up from my knee, and I realize distantly that the pick must have severed something important, some vessel that's emptying me onto the ancient stone one pulse at a time.\n\n\"Grubnoz tell you.\" He settles back on his haunches, begins counting on his fingers. \"First, Grikzit boys take fire-man's armor. Good armor. Booyagh-metal. Sell to other tribes, get many-many for it.\"\n\nOne of the goblins is already working at my pauldron, his claws scratching against the steel.\n\n\"Then, Grikzit boys take fire-man's fingers.\" Grubnoz waggles his own. \"Fire-man make magic with fingers, yes? Make the—\" He mimes my hand-gestures, the Telenil forms I use for battle-casting. \"—the sparkly-shapes. No fingers, no shapes. No shapes, no magic.\"\n\nThe cold reaches my hip. I try to move my toes and feel nothing.\n\n\"Then eyes. Then tongue. Then—\" He shrugs. \"Then whatever Grikzit boys want. They angry, fire-man. You burn their brothers. They want to burn you back, but—\" Another shrug. \"—Grubnoz say no fire. Fire-man dies slow.\"\n\nThe goblin at my shoulder finally tears the pauldron free. Cold air touches the sweat-soaked linen beneath. Another goblin starts on my greaves—the one that isn't destroyed, the one still protecting a leg that can feel.\n\n\"You talk too much,\" I tell Grubnoz. \"You should have killed me while I was down.\"\n\nGrubnoz laughs. \"Fire-man still think he wins? Fire-man can't move legs. Can't move arms. Can't—\"\n\n\"Ignisurge.\"\n\nThe word comes out as a whisper. A breath shaped around desperate intention, and my hands aren't even in position because my hands are tied behind my back.\n\nBut Gannis taught me that magic isn't about the hands. Not really. The hands focus. The breath carries. The *will* ignites.\n\nFire blooms between my shoulder blades.\n\nThe leather bindings crisp and part. The goblin behind me screams as his arms catch—he was too close, greedy fingers working at my backplate, and now those fingers are burning. I roll, agony spiking through my ruined knee, and my freed hands come up with flames still licking between them.\n\nGrubnoz scrambles backward. \"KILL! KILL HIM NOW!\"\n\nBut I'm not aiming for Grubnoz.\n\nI'm aiming for the ceiling.\n\nThe mine supports. The ancient timber that holds up a thousand tons of rock and earth. The wood that has been soaking in groundwater for decades, rotting slowly, waiting for something to push it past the point of endurance.\n\n\"IGNISURGE!\"\n\nThis one comes out right. All my training, all my rage, all the love I have for a woman with autumn hair and steady hands—I pour it into the word and the word becomes fire and the fire becomes a lance of pure destruction that punches through the nearest support beam and into the stone beyond.\n\nFor a moment, nothing happens.\n\nThen the ceiling groans.\n\nGrubnoz's eyes go wide. He scrambles for the breach in the wall, the passage into the K'tarran ruins where something old and terrible sleeps. The other goblins scatter, shrieking, some toward the main shaft and some deeper into the tunnels and some simply running in circles because fear has eaten their minds.\n\nI can't run. Can't even crawl. The magic took everything I had left, and now I am simply meat on stone, watching the cracks spread across the ceiling like dark lightning.\n\n\"Elara,\" I say.\n\nA chunk of limestone the size of a cart crashes down three feet from my head. Dust fills the air, thick and choking. Through it, I see Grubnoz's shape disappearing through the breach, Whisperwind still clutched in his hand.\n\nHe's taking my sword into that darkness. Into whatever sleeps beneath these ruins.\n\nAnother impact. Closer. The ground shakes, and somewhere in the chaos I hear the main shaft collapsing, the wooden platforms splintering, the escape route I'll never use folding in on itself.\n\n\"Elara.\"\n\nI close my eyes.",

His cock has finally shrunk back, fear overwhelming even goblin biology.\n\n\"Drop it,\" I command.\n\nHe throws it at me.\n\nClumsy with terror. Awkward and wild. I sidestep easily, but—\n\nThe collar hits Whisperwind.\n\nThe sword screams—a sound no steel should make, a shriek from somewhere deeper than metal. The blade jerks in my hand like a living thing trying to flee.\n\nThe collar bounces off, lands on the stone between us. We both stare at it.\n\nThe goblin moves first, scrambling to grab it again. I lunge forward, boot coming down where his hand would be. He jerks back. I swing Whisperwind in a killing arc—\n\nThe collar springs open.\n\nNo one touched it. It just... opens. A mouth made of hunger.\n\nDark energy bleeds from it—visible, black, alive. It ignores the goblin entirely and lunges for me.\n\nWhisperwind comes up. The darkness splits around the blade and reforms behind it, tightening like a noose.\n\nThe collar hits my palm an inch from my throat. The metal burns so cold my fingers die instantly—just gone, wooden stumps wrapped around iron that writhes with symbols crawling like fat black beetles across its surface.\n\nThe goblin's backing away, terrified.\n\nThe collar pulls harder. My arm shakes with the effort of holding it back. Whisperwind falls from my other hand—I need both hands now, fighting this thing that wants my throat.\n\n\"Ignisurge!\"\n\nFire washes over the collar. It doesn't even warm.\n\n\"Glacieshold!\"\n\nIce encases it. The collar shatters the ice from within.\n\nMy knees buckle. The collar's winning. Inch by inch, it moves toward my throat. The symbols glow now, purple-black like bruises, like the space between stars.\n\nThe goblin's almost at the door. He looks back once, sees me losing, and does something unexpected.\n\nHe laughs.\n\nA sound like cracked pottery—all nerves, no triumph. Like he can't believe what's happening either.\n\nIce races through my veins. Older than Glacieshold. Meaner. My vision fractures. I see the temple as it was—filled with worshippers in black robes, the altar wet with sacrifice, something vast and terrible accepting their offerings.\n\nThen darkness. Complete and total.\n\nThe last thing I hear is the goblin's feet slapping on stone as he runs.\n\nThe last thing I think is: Elara, I'm sorry.\n\n[Choice: Everything goes black...",

Goblin yellow. She opens her mouth to speak and that chittering language spills out, wet and wrong. I try to scream but my voice comes out in the same foul tongue—\n\n[Video]\n\nCold stone slaps me awake.\n\nMy skull throbs. Each heartbeat hammers against bone like a smith working iron. The taste of copper coats my throat. Where... the mine. The ruins. That green bastard with the collar—\n\nI try to sit up.\n\nWeight drags at my ribs. Two masses of flesh, heavy as saddlebags, pulling me forward before I've finished moving. They swing when I stop—a sickening delay, like carrying something alive that doesn't know I've changed direction.\n\nMy hand goes to check for wounds and sinks knuckle-deep into warm, yielding meat that overflows my grip.\n\nGrowing from my chest. Part of me.\n\nEach gasp lifts them against my fingers and drops them again—warm dough that won't stop moving. Metal scales bite crescents into skin so tender my jaw locks. Cold air finds my stomach, my ribs, acres of bare skin where mail and leather should be.\n\nI force myself upright. The tits—call them what they are—lurch forward with my momentum, then rebound against my ribs hard enough to make me gag. I pitch forward like a ship taking on water. My hands shoot out and I see them in the cave-moss glow.\n\nHands like a noblewoman's—tapered fingers without a single callus, smooth as if they'd never gripped anything heavier than embroidery silk.\n\n[Image: No. No no no.\n\nHair falls across my vision—a black curtain that wasn't there this morning. I shake my head and feel the weight of it sweep past my shoulder blades, clinging to sweat-damp skin all the way to my waist.\n\nI look down.\n\nTwo obscene mounds strain against metal triangles that wouldn't cover a man's palm. These hands are smaller. Everything is smaller except what hangs from my chest. The plates are connected by thin chains that dig into the soft meat, leaving red marks. Below them, my stomach is bare, pale, soft. No scars. No muscle. Just smooth skin leading down to where a metal strap barely wider than my thumb crosses my hips, diving between—\n\nThe space between my thighs is smooth. Sealed shut. Where my cock should be there's just a cleft of yielding flesh that the air touches like a wound.\n\nMy hands fly to my throat. Cold iron. A collar that grinds against my windpipe when I swallow. Something hums inside it—a vibration like pressing your ear to a wasp nest, patient and full of purpose.\n\nThis isn't my body. Every nerve ending disagrees. Gooseflesh on acres of bare skin. Metal biting into places I never had. The drag of tits I can't put down, and between my legs, an emptiness that aches like a missing tooth the size of my fist.\n\nMy voice catches in my throat. When I swallow, the collar constricts.\n\n[Choice: Try to stand up.",

My calves seize instantly—tendons stretched to snapping, ankles wobbling on points no wider than arrow-tips. The tits launch forward before I've finished standing, dragging my whole center of gravity with them. I windmill backward but the boots won't let me plant my feet flat. They force everything into a curve: chest forward, spine arched, ass thrust back, the whole body arranged around a pair of metal stakes and the desperate wish not to fall.\n\nMy thighs press together—soft as bread dough, sliding against each other with a friction that shouldn't exist. Fat thighs. Woman's thighs that kiss when I walk. The metal strap between my legs rides up, cutting into places that—\n\n*Crack.*\n\nMy ass hits stone hard enough to rattle my teeth—and keeps hitting, the impact rippling through flesh that won't stop moving. My tits fly up and slam back down, my ass spreads beneath me like warm clay, and when my hands shoot back to catch myself they sink wrist-deep into asscheek. I'm sitting on my own body fat and it's still jiggling three seconds after I've stopped.\n\n\"Flux's balls!\"\n\nThe voice that comes out is a soprano bell. Clear, musical, the kind of voice bards write about. From MY throat.\n\nThe ancient city. I'm still in the ruins. That goblin—where is he?

Just smooth skin and that metal strap that digs in when I twist.\n\nI look down at my legs properly for the first time. Black metal encases them from mid-thigh down, articulated plates that should be armor but aren't. The plates stop at the ankle, then the metal continues but wrong—the foot is arched severely, forcing me onto a narrow point no wider than a spear butt. A spike of metal extends down from the heel. No wonder I can't fucking walk.\n\n[Image: These aren't soldier's boots. They're... something else.\n\nNo soldier ever wore these. The arch forces my weight forward, the spike forces my ass back, and the wobble forces my hips to sway with every step.

      "text": "[[Image: These massive, hanging things are part of my body.\nMy hands move to the weights hanging from my chest.\n\nSweet merciful Eon, they're attached to me.\n\nThe flesh gives under my fingers like dough left to rise too long—warm, yielding. And I can feel my own touch THROUGH it. When I press, the meat compresses and bulges sideways between my fingers, more than two hands can hold. Pressure from inside AND outside simultaneously—I'm groping myself and being groped at the same time, and my brain can't reconcile the two.\n\nI try to lift one. The weight shocks me—heavy as a full waterskin but shapeless, filling my grip and oozing between my fingers like something alive. The metal triangle covers maybe a third of it. The rest spills around the edges, angry red crescents bitten into pale skin. When I let go, it drops and SLAPS my ribs hard enough to sting.\n\n[Image: The metal triangles barely cover anything. My fingers find soft flesh spilling out around the edges, warm and yielding like overripe fruit in summer heat.\n\nMy strength is gone. These arms that once hefted a zweihander now struggle with the weight of... of these things. I try to flex, to summon the power that should be there, but the muscle is buried under softness. My arms are slender, weak, made for needlework not swordwork.\n\nWhen I lean forward to stand, they swing. The momentum nearly topples me again—first the fall forward, then the flesh following a heartbeat later, then the backward pull as they settle. My hands fly up instinctively to stop their movement and I feel them overflow my palms, soft and warm and wrong. The metal triangles dig deeper with each bounce, leaving marks I can feel burning into the tender skin.\n\nWhere my chest should be hard with muscle, carved from years of swordwork, there's just... yielding softness. I press where my pectorals should be and find only these mounds that compress and spring back with a elasticity that makes my stomach lurch. They're sensitive too—when the cold metal shifts, I feel it like needles. When air moves across the exposed flesh, goosebumps rise.\n\nThe puddle. I crawl toward it on hands and knees because standing in these metal torture-boots is impossible. But crawling is worse—the weights hang free, swaying with each movement, pulling at my shoulders and upper back. They brush the ground when I lean too far forward. The sensation of cold stone against that tender flesh makes me recoil, which sets them swinging again.\n\nI reach the water's edge. My reflection wavers in the dim green light.\n\n[Image: This can't be me. This CAN'T be me.\n\nThe face looking back isn't mine. It can't be mine. Delicate features, high cheekbones, full lips. Pale skin without a single battle scar. Long black hair frames everything like mourning silk. But the eyes—\n\nMy eyes. Aldric's eyes. The same green, the same shape, trapped in this stranger's face.\n\n[Video]\n\n\"No.\" The word comes out in that musical feminine voice. \"No, this is—this is sorcery, this is—\"\n\nMy hand goes to my face. The reflection moves with me. Soft cheek, smooth jaw, no stubble. The hand touching that face is small, elegant, with tapered fingers meant for needlework, not swordwork.\n\nThis is my face. My hand. My body.\n\n\"NO!\" The scream tears from my throat, high and desperate. It echoes off the cavern walls, throwing back a woman's anguish. \"This isn't—I'm not—\"\n\n[Video]I try to stand, to run, to get away from the reflection. The metal boots scrape and clatter. My ankles buckle. The weights on my chest throw me off balance. I take one wobbling step, then another, the metal heel-spikes ringing against stone like a death knell.\n\n*Clop. Clop. Clop.*\n\nEach step forces my hips to sway. The soft meat of my thighs brushes together. The metal thong saws deeper between my cheeks with each step, finding nerve endings that have no business existing. Everything moves wrong—delayed, exaggerated, humiliating.\n\nThat's when I hear it.[[Video]\n\nMy hands move to my face.\n\nMy jaw tapers to a point. Cheekbones too high, too delicate—like someone filed the angles off a hero's face and left a courtesan's. The skin is smooth as fresh cream. No stubble. No scars from that bar fight in Westford. Just silk-soft flesh that yields under my fingertips like I'm touching someone else.\n\nMy lips—Eon's mercy. Full and plush, the kind that part on their own when you breathe through your mouth, that feel every shift of air like a kiss.\n\nHair keeps falling in my face. I grab a fistful—it's like holding water made of shadow, so soft it barely has substance. Black as midnight, falling past my shoulders, past my shoulder blades, almost to my waist. Maiden's hair. The kind knights write stupid songs about.\n\nNo. No no no no—\n\nI need to see. The puddle—there's water there, still and dark.\n\nI crawl toward it on hands and knees because standing in these metal torture-boots is impossible. The weights on my chest swing with each movement, heavy as grain sacks but soft, pulling at my ribs. My ass—there's too much of it, swaying as I move. Each forward crawl drags the metal strip against my pussy like a cheese wire through butter.\n\nThe water is black as pitch, but I can see—\n\n[Image: This can't be me. This CAN'T be me.\n\nPale. Beautiful. The kind of face that makes men kill each other in taverns. High cheekbones, full lips, eyes like moss after rain—my eyes, MY EXACT EYES in this... this...\n\n\"No!\" The scream tears from my throat, high and clear and wrong. \"This isn't—I'm not—\"\n\nMy reflection moves when I move. When I touch my cheek, she touches hers. When my mouth opens in horror, so does hers. The collar sits black at her throat—my throat—like an owner's mark on livestock.\n\nI pull back, gasping. My chest heaves and the weights—breasts, they're breasts, massive ones barely contained by triangular metal plates—bounce and sway. Each breath makes them rise and fall. I can't stop staring at them, at these obscene fleshy mountains jutting from my chest.\n\n[Image: These massive, hanging things are part of my body.\n\nMy hands move without thinking, grabbing them. They overflow my grip, soft and warm and wrong wrong WRONG. When I squeeze, trying to prove they're false, pain shoots through them. They're real. They're part of me.\n\n\"Magic,\" I whisper, voice breaking. \"That goblin—he did this. Some kind of curse, an illusion—\"\n\nBut I can feel everything. The cold air on my exposed stomach. The way my thighs rub together. The horrifying absence between my legs where my cock should be. This isn't an illusion. This is my body now.\n\n[Video]I try to stand again, hands braced on the cave wall. The metal boots force me up on the points of my toes, calves screaming. My hips sway wrong, my balance is fucked, these things on my chest throw off every movement—\n\n*Clack. Clack. Clack.*\n\nEach step is agony. The boots scrape and ring against stone as I wobble forward like a newborn colt. My ass juts out, my back arches to compensate for the weight up front. I take three steps and nearly fall again.\n\nThat's when I hear it.\n\nMy hand moves down past the soft belly that shouldn't exist. Past hips that flare out like a breeding mare's haunches. The metal strap—Eon's mercy, it's barely wider than a sword belt—cuts between flesh that's too abundant, too soft.\n\nMy fingers find where it dives between my thighs and—\n\nNothing.\n\nSmooth skin and a cleft of yielding flesh where my cock should be. Like reaching for a sword that was never forged—the hand closes on empty air and the brain screams wrong. NO.\n\nMy hand jerks back like I've touched molten iron. But the sensation remains. The air on places that should never feel air. The way my thighs press together with nothing between them but that cursed metal strap that rides up into—\n\n\"Flux take this nightmare!\"\n\n[Video]I need to see. Need to prove this is some spell, some illusion. I try to stand again, hands braced on the stone. The metal boots scrape and shriek. My ankles wobble on their torture-points. One step. The weights on my chest swing left. Another step. They swing right, pulling me off balance. My ass—Verge's teeth, there's so much of it—shifts and bounces with each movement like saddlebags overpacked with grain.\n\n*Clop. Scrape. Clop.*\n\nThe pool is only ten paces but it might as well be ten leagues. Each step is a battle against this body that moves wrong, weighs wrong, *is* wrong. My thighs brush together, skin already chafing. The metal triangle covering my... covering what *should* be there... it shifts with each step, a constant reminder of the void.\n\nThe black water holds secrets I don't want to know. But I lean forward, and—\n\nMy hair falls around my face like a funeral shroud. Black silk, longer than my arm, pooling on the wet stone. It smells of lavender and something darker, earthier. Not my hair. Not my smell.\n\nIn the water's mirror, a woman looks back.\n\n[Image: This can't be me. This CAN'T be me.\n\nThe same green eyes—MY eyes—set in a face carved from moonlight and sin. High cheekbones that could cut glass. Lips like split fruit, too full, too soft. The face men kill for and over. The kind of face that belongs in a whorehouse painting, not on a hero's shoulders.\n\nBut those are my eyes. Frightened. Horrified. *Mine*.\n\n\"No no no NO—\"\n\n[Image: The metal triangles barely cover anything.\n\nMy hands fly to my face, and the reflection's hands—small, delicate, with fingers meant for harps not swords—mirror the motion. The skin is soft as fresh cream. No beard-shadow. No scars from a hundred battles. Just pale perfection that makes me want to vomit.\n\nI pull back and see more. The metal triangles barely contain flesh that spills out from all sides—breasts like ripe melons, heavy enough to crack a man's skull. Below them, that narrow waist, those obscene hips, and between the thighs—\n\n[Video]\n\nI scream.\n\nIt comes out high and clear and beautiful, a woman's terror from a woman's throat. The ancient city throws it back at me, mocking echoes of feminine anguish.\n\nThat's when I hear it.\n\nLaughter.[Choice: Laughter.",

The goblin steps into the bioluminescent glow, and my stomach drops.\n\nHe's not running. Not cowering. He's... appraising.\n\nThose yellow eyes are narrow with something worse than fear. They travel up my body the way a butcher looks at a hanging carcass—starting at the spike-heels, climbing my bare thighs, stopping at my chest long enough to make my skin crawl.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nJust that. One sound. But the way his gaze locks onto my chest, the way his head tilts like he's trying to understand what he's seeing—\n\n\"Big,\" he says, voice rougher than I remember. Lower. He takes a step closer, and I take one back. The metal heels shriek against stone. My balance fails. The weights on my chest swing violently, and his eyes track the movement like a cat watching a bird.\n\nAnother step. He's barely taller than my waist in these torture-boots, but the way he's looking at me—\n\n\"Bigger than me mum's.\" His tongue, black and too long, runs across his lips. \"Bigger than any cow's.\"\n\n*Cow.*\n\nThe word hits like a slap.\n\n\"Cow-tits.\" He grins, showing teeth like broken glass. \"That's what ye are now. Look at 'em bounce.\"\n\nHeat floods my face, my neck, my chest. Not rage—something worse, something I don't have a name for until it's already consuming me. Being LOOKED AT. Evaluated. Found useful.\n\n\"Get AWAY from me!\" The scream tears from my throat, high and desperate. \"I'll burn you to ASH! I'll—\"\n\nBut he's not backing away. He's circling now, that disgusting chuckle bubbling up from his throat. His loincloth tents obscenely as he moves, something massive shifting beneath the ratty fabric.\n\n\"Burn me?\" Another laugh. \"With them tits floppin' about? Can ye even see past 'em?\"\n\nRage. White-hot, pure rage floods my veins. How DARE this creature, this THING that I've killed hundreds of, speak to me like—\n\n\"I am ALDRIC THE GREAT!\" I roar, but it comes out as a woman's shriek. \"I've slaughtered your kind by the score! I'll turn you to cinders!\"\n\n\"All I see is cow-tits with a pretty hole,\" he says simply, eyes dropping to the gap between my thighs where the metal strap barely covers anything.\n\nThe humiliation burns hotter than any fire I've ever conjured. My skin feels like it's being flayed by his gaze alone. Every inch he looks at becomes hyperaware—the soft flesh of my belly, the curve of my hips, the way my thighs press together.\n\nThis is what it's like to be meat.\n\n\"Gonna be fun,\" he mutters, adjusting the massive bulge in his loincloth. \"Real fun.\"\n\nNo. NO. I'm still a battlemage. I still have power. I'll show this revolting little beast what happens when you corner Aldric—when you corner ANY mage.\n\nMy hands rise, fingers already forming the gestures.)The laughter starts low—a wet, phlegmy sound like someone drowning in their own spit.\n\nA shadow moves in the green phosphorescence. The goblin. That same stunted piece of shit I was chasing, but... different. He's not scrambling away. Not cowering. He's standing there, three and a half feet of warty green flesh, studying me like a butcher evaluating meat.\n\nHis yellow eyes track down from my face—slow, deliberate. They linger on my chest where these obscene weights strain against their metal triangles. Then lower. Then back up. The fear that was in those eyes when I was Aldric? Gone. Replaced by something that makes my skin crawl.\n\nI try to stand taller, to summon some authority despite wobbling on these torture-spikes. \"Stay back, you diseased little—\"\n\nMy voice. Flux's balls, my VOICE. High and clear like temple bells. The goblin's lips peel back, revealing teeth like cemetery stones.\n\nHe takes a step closer. Just one. His head tilts, studying. I can smell him from here—onions left to rot in piss. But it's the way he's LOOKING at me that makes bile rise in my throat. Not like prey looks at a predator. Not even like an enemy.\n\nLike a man looks at a whore.\n\nMy hand reaches for Whisperwind. Finds soft hip. Nothing.\n\nThe goblin sees the empty grab. His fear dies right there—I watch it leave his yellow eyes like smoke through a crack. What replaces it is worse.\n\nHe starts circling. Roach-quick, making me pivot on these metal stakes, my balance ruined, every adjustment setting the flesh on my chest swinging. His breathing thickens. A line of drool forms at his lip. His eyes track my tits like a cat watching a wounded bird.\n\n\"Get BACK.\" My voice comes out pleading. I meant it as a command.\n\nHe still hasn't spoken. Just that wet mouth-breathing, closer now. Close enough to see the boils on his neck. Close enough to smell him—onions rotting in piss. His loincloth tents with something massive shifting underneath.\n\nThen he speaks.\n\n\"Bigger than me mum's.\" His tongue, black and too long, runs across his lips. \"Bigger than any cow's.\"\n\nThe word hits like a slap.\n\n\"Cow-tits.\" He grins, showing teeth like broken glass. \"That's what ye are now. Look at 'em bounce.\"\n\nSomething tears loose inside me like a sail in storm-wind.\n\n\"You THRACKING—\"\n\nThe rage is volcanic. So many of his kind I've exterminated. And this diseased little cum-stain is looking at my—at these things on my chest like he's shopping for melons at market. This thing that should be DEAD, that should be AFRAID, is calling me—\n\n\"I'LL BURN YOU TO ASH!\" The scream tears from my throat. \"I'll turn you into CHAR! I'll—\"\n\nHe laughs. A wet, choking sound like he's gargling phlegm.\n\n\"Go on then, cow-tits. Show us what ye got.\"\n\nMy hands are already moving, the words of power rising in my throat. This little green shit doesn't know who he's fucking with. Collar or no collar, body or no body, I'm still Aldric the Great. I still have the gift. I'll cook him from the inside out, make him SCREAM, make him BEG—\n\nThe incantation builds on my tongue, sweet as wine, hot as forge-fire. I can feel it gathering in my chest—no, BETWEEN these awful weights, but gathering nonetheless. One word. One gesture. And this goblin becomes a memory and a smell.]The laughter comes from behind a fallen pillar—wet, chittering, like rats drowning in oil.\n\nHe emerges slowly. Not charging, not fleeing. Just... watching.\n\nThe same goblin from before, but everything's different now. His yellow eyes aren't looking at me like I'm Aldric the Great, slayer of his kind. They're looking at me like I'm...\n\nLike I'm *meat*.\n\nHe's three and a half feet of green spite, pot-bellied and bow-legged, but he's not cowering. Not anymore. His gaze travels down from my face—slow, deliberate, savoring—and stops at chest level. A strand of drool actually forms at the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"Heh.\" Just that. One sound. Like he's discovered something amusing.\n\nI try to assume a combat stance. The boots make it impossible—I'm pitched forward on these torture-spikes, calves screaming, my back arched in a way that thrusts my chest forward. The weights there bounce with even the smallest movement. When I shift my feet, trying to find balance, they swing left, then right, the metal triangles biting deeper into tender flesh.\n\nHis eyes track the movement like a cat watching a bird.\n\n\"Big.\"\n\n\"Get—\" My voice cracks. That feminine sound again. I clear my throat, try to make it commanding. \"Get back, you diseased little—\"\n\n\"Bigger than me mum's.\" His tongue, black and too long, runs across his lips. \"Bigger than any cow's.\"\n\n\"Cow-tits.\" He grins, showing teeth like broken glass. \"That's what ye are now. Look at 'em bounce.\"\n\nThe word brands itself into my skull.\n\nRage fills my skull like smoke in a sealed room. No one—NO ONE—has ever looked at me like this. Like I'm something to be leered at. To be *enjoyed*. My skin crawls with a sensation I've never felt before—being undressed by someone's eyes, evaluated like livestock at market. The space between my legs—that horrifying absence—suddenly feels more exposed than if I were naked. Like he can smell the vulnerability on me.\n\nHe takes a step closer. Just one. His head barely reaches my waist but somehow he seems larger. The way he's looking up at me, tongue playing at the corner of his mouth, makes my stomach turn.\n\n\"Soft little thing now, ain't ye?\" Another step. His breathing is audible—wet, excited. \"All them muscles gone. Just... *jiggle*.\"\n\nI try to back away but the heels betray me. My ankle rolls. I have to grab the wall to steady myself, and the motion sets everything swaying—tits, ass, all of it. His yellow eyes go wide with delight.\n\n\"Pretty little bitch,\" he whispers, and the word—*bitch*—lands like a physical blow. \"That's what the magic made ye. From hero to *bitch*.\"\n\nMy hands are shaking. Not from fear—from pure, molten rage. I've been called many things. Murderer. Villain. Monster, by his kind. But never... never this. Never reduced to body parts and holes. Never looked at like something to be *used*.\n\nThe metal between my legs feels cold. Vulnerable. I'm sickeningly aware that there's nothing protecting me there. Just soft flesh where there should be—where there WAS—\n\n\"Stop looking at me.\" The words come out pleading when I meant them as a command.\n\nHe laughs again, that wet chittering. Takes another step. He's ten feet away now, close enough that I can smell him—onions and piss and something else, something thick and musky that makes my nostrils flare.\n\n\"Can't kill me now, can ye?\" He's almost dancing, his excitement palpable. \"Not with them little hands. Not wobbling on them pretty stabby shoes. Just a pair of cow-tits on legs, waiting to be—\"\n\nThat's when I remember.\n\nMagic.\n\nI still have my magic.\n\nThe words of power surge through me like wine, like fire, like vengeance. My hands begin to glow with inner flame. The cave fills with the smell of ozone and fury.\n\n\"You want to see what these 'little hands' can do?\" My voice drops to a snarl.",

      "text": "\"IGNISURGE!\"\n\nThe word tears from my throat with the force of seventeen years' practice. I feel it building—that sweet familiar rush, like molten gold flooding my veins. The fire answers my call as it always has, rising from that place deep in my chest where rage and righteousness meet. My palms tingle with the promise of destruction, the air around my fingers shimmering with heat-haze, the smell of a forge about to birth a blade—\n\nPower surges through my arms, cresting, about to bloom into annihilation—\n\nA puff.\n\nA sad wheeze of smoke that wouldn't light a candle. It dribbles from my palm and dies in the dark.\n\n\"Was that it?\" The goblin's laughter sounds like someone choking on their own spit. \"Was that yer big fire show?\"\n\nI stare at my hands. These soft, small hands that should be wreathed in flames. The magic is THERE—roiling in my chest, pressure behind my ribs, heat climbing my throat. It reaches the collar and goes out like a candle dunked in water. Just cold iron doing nothing visible, and that's enough. My fire breaks against it and vanishes.\n\n\"Try again!\" Snib circles me, that obscene bulge in his loincloth bouncing with each scuttle-step. \"Go on, cow-tits! Give us another puff!\"\n\n\"IGNISURGE!\" I scream it louder, as if volume could break through. The magic builds again—that gorgeous pressure, that divine heat—only to extinguish at the moment of release. Another pathetic wisp of smoke.\n\n\"IGNISURGE! IGNISURGE! IGN—\"\n\nEach attempt is weaker. Like trying to cum with a hand around your cock, squeezing closed. The magic builds and builds with nowhere to go, backing up inside me until I'm shaking with it, until I feel like I might explode from the inside out.\n\n\"The collar,\" Snib says, and he's close now, so close I can smell the rot on his breath. \"It talks to me. Whispers things.\" His head tilts, those yellow eyes narrowing. \"Says yer mine now. Says yer magic only works if I lets it.\"\n\n\"That's not—\" My voice cracks. \"That's IMPOSSIBLE—\"\n\n\"Says yer name was Aldric.\" He's grinning now, black tongue playing at the corner of his mouth. \"Aldric the Great. Killed three hundred and seventeen of me kind.\" Another step closer. \"Now look at ye. Tits bigger than yer head and no fire to back up all that yellin'.\"\n\nThe rage is a white sun behind my eyes, fury enough to crack the world's spine, that should turn this entire cavern to glass. But when I raise my hands, when I speak the words that have never failed me—\n\nSmoke. Pathetic, gray smoke.\n\n\"If ye want yer magic,\" Snib says, voice dropping to something almost thoughtful, \"ye gotta ask. Real nice-like. Maybe...\" His eyes travel down my body again, lingering on the heaving of my chest as I pant with fury and exhaustion. \"Maybe do somethin' for me first.\"\n\n\"I'll NEVER—\"\n\n\"Never's a long time, cow-tits.\" He scratches his balls through his loincloth, the motion deliberate, disgusting. \"Specially when yer wobbling on them silly shoes with no magic to save ye.\"\n\nMy entire life, magic has flowed through me like blood through veins. Natural as breathing. The fire lived in my chest, the ice in my bones, the wind in my lungs. To have it there but trapped, like trying to scream with a hand over your mouth, like trying to piss with your cock tied shut—\n\nNo. Not my cock. Because I don't HAVE—\n\nThere. Behind him, fallen among the rubble. Whisperwind's pommel catches the phosphorescent light.\n\nMy sword. My beautiful, faithful sword.\n\nIf magic won't serve me, steel will. Steel has never failed me. One good thrust and this nightmare ends. I just need to—]The words of power rise in my throat like winter storms gathering above the Ironspikes.\n\n\"*Glacieshold!*\"\n\nI taste the spell—crisp as mountain air, sharp as the moment before an avalanche. In my mind's eye, I see it perfectly: ice racing up his disgusting green legs, crystallizing his putrid blood, turning that leering grin into frozen horror. One kick from these torture-boots and he'll shatter into a thousand pieces, each one melting away with this nightmare, returning me to myself, to *Aldric*—\n\nThe magic builds in my chest, that familiar cold fire that's ended a hundred monsters. It spirals down my arms, through my fingers, ready to birth winter itself—\n\nAnd dies.\n\nNot gradually. Not gently. Like a candle snuffed by a giant's fist.\n\n\"Wha—\"\n\nThe goblin's laughter explodes like pus from a lanced boil.\n\n\"That it?\" He slaps his knee like this is the funniest thing he's ever seen. \"That yer big magic, cow-tits?\"\n\nNo. No no no—\n\n\"*GLACIESHOLD!*\" I scream it this time, pouring everything into the word. The magic rises, crests—\n\nDies.\n\nTwo crystals this time. They fall to the stone with tiny *plinks*.\n\n\"*IGNISURGE!*\"\n\nNothing. Not even smoke.\n\n\"*VENTUSFURY!*\"\n\nThe air doesn't even stir.\n\n\"*IGNISURGE! GLACIESHOLD! VENTUSFURY!*\" I'm shrieking now, my feminine voice cracking, spittle flying. My hands shake as I form the gestures over and over—movements that have channeled lightning, that have turned armies—\n\nNothing. Nothing. NOTHING.\n\nThe goblin circles me like a wolf around a lamed deer, his bare feet slapping wetly on stone. I pivot on these fucking heels trying to track him, wobbling, my tits swaying obscenely with each adjustment.\n\n\"Funny thing,\" he says, scratching his balls through his loincloth. \"This pretty collar ye got on—\"\n\nMy hand flies to my throat. The iron is warm now, almost alive.\n\n\"—it talks to me. Whispers things.\" He grins wider. \"Says ye belong to me now.\"\n\n\"I don't belong to—\"\n\n\"Says yer magic?\" He stops directly in front of me, has to crane his neck back to look up at my face. \"Ye only get it when I says so.\"\n\nThe world tilts. My knees actually buckle. The concept is so obscene, so fundamentally WRONG that my mind rejects it. My magic—the gift that made me more than just another sellsword, that lifted me from the mud-quarter to the Tower—locked away by this... this...\n\n\"So if ye EVER want to throw yer little sparkles again,\" he continues, his voice dropping to something oily, \"ye gonna have to ask. Real nice. Maybe...\" His yellow eyes drop to my chest. \"Maybe do something for me first.\"\n\n\"I'll NEVER—\"\n\n\"*IGNISURGE!*\" I scream it with thirty years of rage. \"*BURN, YOU FUCKING PARASITE!*\"\n\nNot even warmth.\n\n\"*GLACIESHOLD! FREEZE AND SHATTER!*\"\n\nThe goblin yawns.\n\n\"*VENTUSFURY! TEAR HIM APART!*\"\n\nA cave-moth lands on my shoulder, undisturbed by any wind.\n\nI'm sobbing now. Actual tears streaming down this soft face as I scream every battle spell, every cantrip, every hedge-magic trick I know. The words pour out in a torrent of desperate, impotent fury while the goblin counts on his fingers, keeping track.\n\n\"That's seventeen,\" he notes casually. \"Ye done?\"\n\nMy throat is raw. My legs shake from standing on these spike-heels. The weights on my chest heave with each gasping breath. I've never felt this—this absolute helplessness. Not when the basilisk had me cornered. Not when the Thuulk Tower masters expelled me. Never.\n\nMagic is what I AM. Without it, I'm just... just...\n\nJust a pair of tits on legs in slutty armor.\n\n\"I'LL KILL YOU!\" The scream tears from my throat. \"I'LL RIP YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF!\"\n\nThat's when I see it. Whisperwind. My blade, lying against a fallen pillar not twenty feet away, still gleaming despite the ancient dust.]Ventusfury.\n\nThe word forms in my mind like a lover's name, like salvation itself. Wind—my oldest friend, my first mastery. I can already see it: this diseased little shit flying backward, bones snapping like kindling against the ancient stone, his skull cracking open like an egg, brains painting the walls in a satisfying splatter of green and gray. The collar's magic will die with him. I'll be myself again. I'll walk out of here Aldric the Great, and this nightmare will become just another tavern tale.\n\nMy hands rise in the Seventh Position—thumb and forefinger forming the eye of the storm, other fingers spread like gale-tracks. The power builds in my chest, that familiar gathering like breathing in a thunderstorm. It starts at the root of my spine, rises through my belly—\n\nThe air should be changing now—pressure dropping, dust beginning to spiral. I've done this a thousand times. Felt the wind answer my call like a war-dog to its master's whistle. The power builds and builds, cresting toward release—\n\n\"*VENTUSFURY!*\"\n\nI thrust my palms forward, channeling everything, EVERYTHING into this moment of glorious violence—\n\n*Poof.*\n\nA breeze. Less than a breeze. A whisper of air that wouldn't disturb a candle flame. It touches Snib's face with all the force of a maiden's sigh, barely ruffling his greasy hair.\n\nSilence floods the space where my storm should have raged.\n\n\"Was that...\" Snib blinks, then his face splits into that broken-glass grin. \"Was that it?\"\n\nNo. No no no NO—\n\n\"*IGNISURGE!*\" I scream, hands already forming the fire-cage gesture. Nothing. Not even warmth.\n\n\"*GLACIESHOLD!*\" The ice that should freeze him solid, that should turn his blood to slush—nothing.\n\n\"*VENTUSFURY! IGNISURGE! GLACIESHOLD!*\" I'm shrieking now, cycling through every form, every word of power, my hands a blur of desperate gestures. But it's like screaming into the void. The magic is THERE, I can feel it inside me, but it hits something at my throat and just... stops. Like trying to pour wine through a closed cork.\n\nSnib's laughing so hard he's wheezing, doubled over, slapping his knee.\n\n\"Oh... oh that's...\" He gasps for air between cackles. \"That's fuckin' BEAUTIFUL! The great hero, flappin' her hands like a broke-wing bird!\"\n\n\"WORK!\" I scream at my hands. \"THRACKING WORK!\"\n\n\"It's telling me things,\" Snib says, tapping his temple, his laughter dying to wet chuckles. \"The collar. Don't know what it is exactly, but it's whisperin' real sweet about you.\" He starts circling me again, and I have to wobble on these torture-heels to track him. \"Says yer mine now. Says that magic ye're so proud of?\"\n\nHe stops directly in front of me, looking up with those yellow eyes full of malicious glee.\n\n\"Ye can't use it without me permission.\"\n\nThe words hit like a physical blow. My magic—the thing that makes me more than just another sellsword, the power I earned through pain and study and sacrifice—is now locked behind this creature's approval?\n\n\"That's...\" My voice comes out strangled. \"That's not possible.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's possible, cow-tits. Ye want to cast yer little spells? Gonna have to ask real nice.\" His tongue plays at the corner of his mouth. \"Maybe do somethin' for me first.\"\n\n\"NEVER!\" The scream tears from my throat. \"I'll die first! I'll—*IGNISURGE!*\"\n\nNothing.\n\n\"*GLACIESHOLD!*\"\n\nNothing.\n\nI'm screaming the words now, over and over, my throat going raw. Each failed spell is another humiliation, another confirmation that I'm trapped, that this THING owns my power. Snib's laughing so hard he's crying, pointing at me as I flail and shriek like a madwoman.\n\n\"Look at ye! Flappin' and screamin'! Like a chicken with them fat tits!\"\n\nMy vision blurs with tears of pure rage. Through the film of fury, I see it—a glint of metal among the rubble.\n\nWhisperwind.\n\nMy sword, transformed like everything else but still MINE. Still sharp. I don't need magic to run three feet of steel through his diseased heart.",

      "text": "The Harrow Guard Ninth Position—a diving roll that becomes a rising thrust, catching the enemy through the soft palate as they pursue. I've done it a hundred times. Muscle memory older than half the men I've trained.\n\nTwenty feet. Whisperwind gleams against ancient stone like salvation itself.\n\nI launch forward.\n\nExcept.\n\nThese aren't my muscles. The legs that should coil and spring like siege engines are soft, weak. The center of gravity that should be in my chest is—FLUX'S BALLS—it's in these obscene sacks of flesh hanging from my ribs. They swing forward with my momentum like twin grain sacks, pulling me off balance before I've taken a single step.\n\nThe metal heel-spikes shriek against stone. My ankle rolls. The weights on my chest swing violently left and I try to compensate but they're already swinging back right and—\n\nI go down like a pole-axed cow.\n\nMy knees hit first—a crack that sends lightning up my thighs. Then my palms slap stone, and the momentum carries those massive flesh-bags forward with a sound like wet meat hitting a butcher's block. They CLAP together between my arms, compressed and bulging sideways, the metal triangles biting so deep I see stars.\n\n\"HAAAAAHAHAHA!\"\n\nThe goblin's laughter could strip paint. But worse than the laughter is the sound of his bare feet slapping stone as he scuttles up behind me.\n\nI try to scramble forward, to crawl if I have to, but these thrakking tits are pinned between my arms and the floor, dragging like anchors. My palms slip on ancient dust. The metal barely covering my ass rides up between the cheeks like a cheese wire.\n\nThat's when his hand connects.\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nThe sound echoes through the cavern like a whip-crack. Pain blooms across my right ass cheek—not the deep pain of a wound but something worse. Something... humiliating. The flesh jiggles from the impact, a ripple of movement I can FEEL, like disturbed water.\n\n\"Look at that wobble!\" He spanks me again, harder. *CRACK!* \"Like hittin' a sack of pudding!\"\n\nI try to roll sideways but he plants his foot on my lower back, pinning me. I'm trapped on all fours like a dog, these horrible udders swaying beneath me, ass presented to this diseased creature who—\n\n*CRACK!* Left cheek this time.\n\n\"This what heroes are made of now?\" *CRACK!* \"All this soft meat?\" *CRACK!*\n\nThe words cut deeper than the pain. For some reason, I think of Elara. This morning I had her bent over our bed, my hand on her beautiful ass as we tried for a child, and now—\n\n*CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!*\n\nHe's found a rhythm, alternating cheeks. The flesh bounces and jiggles with each impact, a motion I can't control, can't stop. Tears stream down my face—not from pain but from pure, distilled humiliation.\n\n\"Name's Snib, by the way.\" *CRACK!* \"Figured ye should know who owns ye.\" *CRACK!* \"Who's turnin' the great hero into a mewling cow.\"\n\n\"I'll—\" *CRACK!* \"—kill—\" *CRACK!* \"—you—\" *CRACK!*\n\nEach word is followed by his palm on my ass, the sound wet now from sweat. My own sweat. These cheeks are so massive they're actually sweating from being spanked, the moisture making each impact sound like wet meat being tenderized.\n\n\"With what?\" He stops spanking just to SQUEEZE, his fingers sinking into the soft flesh like dough. \"These little hands? These floppy udders? This fat ass I'm playing like a drum?\"\n\nI sob. The sound that comes out is high, broken, nothing like Aldric's voice. It's a woman's defeat leaking from a woman's throat.\n\n\"Please just—\" The words tear out before I can stop them. \"Just fucking DIE! PLEASE! Just die and let this END!\"\n\n\"Aww,\" Snib coos, his hand rubbing circles on my burning ass cheek like he's soothing a child. \"The big hero's beggin' now. Music to me ears.\"\n\nSomething in me snaps. Not breaks—SNAPS back like a drawn bowstring.\n\nIf I can just—if I can get my hands on him—\"You know what you are?\" I start circling left, keeping my voice steady despite the wobble in these torture-spikes. \"You're nothing. Pest. Vermin that—\"\n\nThe weights on my chest swing left. I have to correct right. The metal heels scrape stone.\n\n\"—that infests decent people's—\"\n\nSwing right. Correct left. My ass——there's so much ASS on me now—it shifts like saddlebags overpacked with grain.\n\n\"—decent people's lands.\"\n\nWhisperwind is five steps behind him now. I just need to keep him focused on my face while I work my way around. The insults come easy—seventeen years of killing his kind provides material.\n\n\"Your mother fucked pigs to make something as ugly as—\"\n\nMy ankle rolls. The metal spike slips on something wet—moss? Goblin piss? My arms windmill. The meat on my chest flies up toward my face, then crashes down. I stumble backward, trying to catch myself, but these legs don't move right, these hips are too wide, everything's wrong—\n\n[Image: Not AGAIN!\n\nMy ass hits stone like a sack of flour dropped from a height.\n\nThe impact sends everything jiggling—tits bouncing up and actually SLAPPING together with a meaty *CLAP*, ass spreading and compressing, thighs wobbling like custard. My teeth click together. My tailbone screams.\n\n\"Hehehehe—LOOK at 'em!\"\n\nHis fingers sink into my left tit like he's testing bread dough. Small, warty fingers that barely cover a quarter of the flesh, squeezing and lifting. The sensation—Eon's mercy, I can FEEL it. Not like being grabbed by the arm or shoulder. This is different. Soft flesh compressing between his fingers, nerve endings I didn't know existed firing all at once.\n\n\"No no no NO—\"\n\nHis other hand grabs the right one. Lifts it. Lets it drop. It falls like a water-filled pig's bladder, bouncing twice before settling.\n\n\"Like bags of pudding!\" He's giggling—actually GIGGLING like a child with a new toy. \"Lookitlookitlookit—\"\n\nSLAP. His palm connects with the side of my right tit, sending it flying into the left one. They collide with another of those horrible meat-claps.\n\n\"Stop—fucking STOP—\"\n\nSLAP. The left one this time. The flesh ripples in waves.\n\n\"Squish squish squish!\" He's got both now, one in each hand, squeezing rhythmically like he's milking a cow.\n\nThe position is impossible—I'm on my ass, legs splayed to keep from falling backward, these metal triangles doing nothing to protect me from his groping. He pushes them together, making them bulge up toward my face. Pulls them apart. Pushes them together again.\n\n\"Heavier than me head!\" He actually tries to lift one to test, the weight pulling at my chest. \"How'd ye even walk with these?\"\n\n\"Get your fucking hands—\"\n\nHe pinches something. A peak that's gone hard in the cold air, visible through the metal triangle.\n\n\"I'm going to kill you.\" The words come out breathless. \"I'm going to tear your—\"\n\n\"With what?\" He jiggles them again, watching them move with fascination. \"These floppy things? Gonna tit-slap me to death?\"\n\nThe rage is beyond anything I've ever felt. Not the clean rage of battle, but something deeper, more poisonous. The rage of being made into a joke. Of having parts of me that shouldn't exist being grabbed by hands that should be dead.\n\n\"Name's Snib, by the way.\" He grins up at me, still kneading like he's making bread. \"Figured ye should know who owns these now.\"\n\n*Owns.*\n\nThe word breaks something in me.]I've charged enemies a hundred times. Low shoulder, explosive forward drive, come up swinging in the Reaper's Arc after plowing through. Fighting techqniues are carved into my bones. This stunted little shit won't expect the speed, the violence of it. I'll go through him like he's made of parchment.\n\nI drop my shoulder and drive forward.\n\nThe first step in these metal torture-spikes nearly ends it. My ankle rolls, the heel catching on nothing. But I compensate, muscle memory adjusting—except the muscle memory is for a body that weighed two hundred pounds of trained sinew, not... this.\n\nThe weights on my chest swing violently left with my momentum. The physics are all wrong—like carrying two sacks of grain that aren't tied down, that move on their own time. They pull me off-line. I correct right but they're still swinging left and now I'm stumbling, the metal boots scraping and catching, my thighs—these soft, doughy things—rubbing together, throwing off my gait.\n\nSnib sidesteps.\n\nJust sidesteps. Like avoiding a drunk.\n\nMy balance, already fucked, goes completely. The floor comes up fast. Instinct makes me throw my hands out, and I hit stone on all fours with a meaty SLAP that echoes through the ancient chamber.\n\nThe impact—Flux's balls, the IMPACT. These things hanging from my chest swing down and CLAP together like wet meat in a butcher's shop, the sound obscene in the cavern's silence. Pain shoots through them from the collision. They bounce back up, then down again, smaller claps following the first like thunder after lightning.\n\nMy ass—there's so much of it—is up in the air, the position forcing it high while my face is nearly on the stone. The metal triangle that's supposed to be armor has ridden up into the crack, leaving the cheeks completely exposed. Cold air on skin that shouldn't exist.\n\nThat's when his hand connects.\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nThe sound is tremendous. My whole body lurches forward from the impact, these obscene meat-sacks under me swinging wild. The sting spreads across my right cheek like fire, but worse—so much worse—is the way the flesh JIGGLES. Ripples running through meat that should be hard muscle, wobbling like a kicked pudding.\n\n\"HAH!\" His laugh is right behind me. Close. Too close. \"Look at that arse dance!\"\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nThe left cheek this time. I try to drop flat, to deny him the target, but he grabs the metal strap between my cheeks and PULLS, keeping my ass elevated.\n\n\"Nah nah, keep it up there, cow-tits. Ye were chargin' so brave-like!\"\n\n*CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!*\n\nEach impact sends waves through this soft flesh. I can FEEL it jiggling, can hear the meat slapping against itself. My face burns with shame hotter than the stinging in my ass. This morning I was inside Elara, powerful, dominant. Now I'm on all fours getting my ass beaten by something I should be able to step on.\n\n\"Big jiggly hero!\" *CRACK!* \"Look at them cheeks bounce!\" *CRACK!* \"Bet ye didn't have this much arse before!\" *CRACK!*\n\nTears are streaming down my face. Not from pain—I've been stabbed, burned, had bones broken. This is nothing. It's the HUMILIATION. The complete inversion of everything I am. Warriors don't get spanked. Heroes don't get their asses played with by goblins. MEN don't—\n\nHis fingers suddenly DIG into the soft flesh, kneading it like dough.\n\n\"Soft as butter,\" he mutters, almost amazed.\n\nI thrash, trying to shake him off, but the movement just makes everything worse. My tits swing and collide beneath me. My ass jiggles in his grip. The metal boots scrape uselessly on stone.\n\n\"LET GO!\" I shriek. That feminine voice again, high and desperate.\n\n\"Name's Snib,\" he says conversationally, still groping, fingers sinking into flesh that yields like warm bread. \"Figured ye should know who owns ye now.\"\n\n\"You don't own—\"\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nThis one's harder. Hard enough that I collapse forward, my soft tits compressed against cold stone. He keeps his grip on my ass, keeping it elevated, on display.\n\n\"Oh, I owns ye alright. The collar says so. Says ye're mine to do whatever with.\" Another squeeze, his fingers finding the crease where thigh meets ass. \"And look at all this ye got now. All this soft, jiggly meat where yer muscles used to be.\"\n\nMy mind is fracturing. This can't be happening. I'm Aldric the Great. I've slain dragons. I've saved kingdoms. I don't get spanked by goblins. I don't have an ass that jiggles. I don't have TITS that clap together when I fall.\n\nBut I do.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming—the weight pulling at my chest, the sting across my cheeks, the soft flesh currently being kneaded by diseased green fingers.\n\n\"KILL YOU!\" I scream into the stone. \"I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!\"\n\n\"With what?\" Another CRACK across my ass. \"Them little hands? That high squeaky voice? Gonna bounce me to death with them tits?\"",

      "text": "The Seventh Legion teaches you to use whatever's at hand. Right now, what's at hand is rage and this soft, heavy body.\n\nMy fingers wrap around his scrawny ankle—thin as a child's wrist, all knobby bone and warty skin. One good YANK and he goes down hard, his head cracking against stone with a sound like a dropped melon.\n\n\"GAAAH!\"\n\nHe's on his back, dazed. I'm on him before he can recover, using the only advantage I have—weight. These obscene sacks of flesh on my chest actually help for once, pinning his scrawny frame as I straddle him. My hands find his throat. It's like gripping a plucked chicken neck, all gristle and loose skin.\n\n\"Die.\" The word comes out as a hiss. \"Die die DIE—\"\n\nMy thumbs press into his windpipe. His yellow eyes bulge. His hands scrabble at my wrists but I've got leverage now, got position. The metal boots actually help, the heel-spikes digging into stone for purchase. I lean forward, putting everything into it—\n\nThe collar BITES.\n\n[Image: The collar explodes into ice around my throat.\nIron teeth punch inward and my windpipe crushes flat. My hands abandon his throat for my own—clawing at smooth metal, no gap, no seam, just cold iron eating into my neck while my lungs burn empty.\n\nI fall sideways, gasping. Black spots dance in my vision. My throat makes horrible clicking sounds as I try to breathe through a windpipe being crushed flat.\n\nSnib coughs, rolls away, then starts laughing. Wet, wheezing laughter as he watches me writhe.\n\n\"Stupid cow!\" He's on his feet now, rubbing his throat. \"Thought ye could kill me? The collar won't let ye!\"\n\nThe pressure eases just enough for me to gasp. Sweet air floods my lungs. But the collar stays tight, a warning, a promise.\n\n\"See, that's the thing.\" He plants his foot on my face, pressing my cheek into the stone. The humiliation of it—his dirty, warty foot on my face while I lie here gasping like a landed fish. \"The collar says I own ye. Means ye can't hurt me. Try it and...\" He makes a choking gesture.\n\n\"Look at me.\" His foot grinds against my cheek. \"LOOK AT ME, CUNT!\"]Fingernails. These soft hands might be useless for holding a sword, but fingernails are fingernails. And eyes are always vulnerable.\n\nI swing around on my knees—the motion sends these fucking udders flying in an arc, but I use it, use the momentum. My hand comes up, fingers hooked into claws, aimed right at those yellow goblin eyes. Just need to hook them out, blind the little shit, then find a rock to cave his skull in—\n\nMy nails rake across his face. Three red lines appear from forehead to chin, just missing his left eye by a hair. Green blood wells up immediately.\n\n\"YAAAAH!\"\n\nHe staggers back, hand to his face. I surge forward on my knees—can't risk standing in these metal spikes—and go for the second strike. Both hands this time, going for the throat, the eyes, anything soft—\n\nHe goes down with me on top. My weight advantage finally useful—these tits and ass might be humiliating but they're HEAVY. I pin his arms with my knees, hands going for his throat, his eyes, switching between targets as he thrashes. Green blood under my nails. His squealing filling the cavern.\n\n\"DIE! Fucking DIE—\"\n\nOne thumb finds his eye socket, starts to press—\n\nThe collar becomes a band of frozen hell around my throat.\n\n[Image: The collar explodes into ice around my throat.\nIron teeth punch inward and my windpipe crushes flat. My hands abandon his throat for my own—clawing at smooth metal, no gap, no seam, just cold iron eating into my neck while my lungs burn empty.\n\nI topple sideways, these massive tits flopping as I hit stone. My legs kick uselessly, the metal boots clanging and scraping. Vision going gray at the edges. Mouth opening and closing like a fish drowning in air.\n\nSnib scrambles away, then starts laughing through his bloody face.\n\n\"HAHA! Stupid bitch! Thought ye could claw me eyes out?\" He wipes green blood from his cheek. \"The collar won't let ye hurt me proper! It owns ye! I own ye!\"\n\nThe pressure eases just enough to let a whistle of air through. I gasp, sob, cough all at once. Snot runs from my nose. Tears stream down my face.\n\n\"See how it works?\" He kicks me in the stomach—not hard, just enough to make his point. \"Ye can't kill me. Can't even hurt me bad. Try it and...\" He makes a strangling gesture.\n\n\"Look at me.\" He grabs my hair, yanks my head back. \"LOOK AT ME, CUNT! Want ye to see who owns ye now!\"]The rage is beyond thought now. Pure animal fury. He's close, standing over me laughing. His loincloth is tented, that massive thing underneath bouncing with his mirth.\n\nTarget acquired.\n\nI rear back and drive my head forward at his crotch with every ounce of strength left in this soft body. The crown of my skull aimed right at that obscene bulge. Even goblins have to feel THAT—\n\nMy forehead connects with something that feels like a leather-wrapped club. The impact reverberates through my skull, makes my teeth click. But more importantly—\n\n\"GRAAAAAAHHH!\"\n\nSnib doubles over, hands flying to his crotch. His massive cock and balls might be his pride but they're also a weakness. He staggers backward, wheezing.\n\nI surge up—or try to. These fucking tits throw me off balance, but I manage to get to my knees. Then I lunge, wrapping my arms around his waist, using my weight to drive him down. We hit stone hard, him on bottom, me on top.\n\nThe position is absurd—my tits are literally in his face, these metal triangles probably cutting into him. But I've got leverage. My hands find his throat while my knees pin his arms. One of the metal heel-spikes is inches from his temple. I raise my foot, ready to drive it through his skull—\n\nThe collar remembers what it is.\n\n[Image: The collar explodes into ice around my throat.\nIron teeth punch inward and my windpipe crushes flat. My hands abandon his throat for my own—clawing at smooth metal, no gap, no seam, just cold iron eating into my neck while my lungs burn empty.\n\nCan't breathe. Can't even gag. Just silent, airless thrashing as my windpipe closes completely.\n\nI fall off him, landing on my side. These fucking weights on my chest heave uselessly, trying to draw air that won't come. My legs kick, the metal boots scraping and clanging. Black flowers bloom across my vision.\n\nSnib coughs, sits up, then starts laughing even while holding his bruised balls.\n\n\"Fuck... ye actually... hahaha... ye headbutted me cock!\" He's wiping tears from his eyes. \"But see? See what happens? The collar won't let ye kill me! It knows I own ye!\"\n\nThe pressure eases a fraction. A whistle of air gets through. I gasp like I'm drowning, strings of drool connecting my lips to the stone floor.\n\n\"That's how it works, cow-tits.\" He stands over me, still rubbing his crotch but grinning. \"The collar says yer mine. Means ye can't hurt me bad. Can't kill me. Try it and it'll strangle ye dead.\"\n\nHe squats down, grabs my hair, yanks my head up.\n\n\"Look at me.\" His voice drops to something almost serious. \"LOOK AT ME, CUNT! Want ye to understand exactly who owns ye now!\"",

Something I've never felt before.\n\nDefeat.\n\n\"I said LOOK AT ME!\" His fingers dig into my hair, yanking harder.\n\nI can't. Won't. My gaze stays fixed on the ancient stones, on the dust of civilizations that died before mine was born. Tears—actual fucking tears—blur my vision. Not from pain. From the crushing realization that I'm trapped. That this diseased little creature has me on a leash I can't break.\n\n\"Aww.\" He releases my hair, lets my head drop. \"The big hero's given up already?\"\n\nHis bare feet slap stone as he circles behind me. I tense, expecting another spanking, but instead—\n\nFingers. Small, warty fingers tracing the curve where my ass meets my thigh. That place that shouldn't exist, that junction of soft flesh I've never had before. His touch follows the crease with disturbing precision, like a butcher evaluating meat.\n\n\"So much woman now,\" he mutters, almost to himself. \"All this soft...\"\n\nHis hand SINKS into my left ass cheek, fingers disappearing into flesh that yields like risen dough. Not a grope—an assessment. The way you'd test a horse's haunches before buying.\n\n\"The collar's tellin' me things,\" he says conversationally, kneading the meat like he owns it. Which he does. \"Says yer Aldric. Big hero. Dragon slayer.\"\n\nI flinch. My name in his mouth feels like defilement.\n\nHis other hand slides around my hip, finding the soft spot where belly meets pelvis.\n\n\"Killed lots of me cousins.\" No anger in it. Just fact. \"The collar says... says I should break ye slow. More fun that way.\"\n\nHis face appears suddenly between my spread thighs, looking up at me from below. This angle—Flux's balls, from this angle these tits must look massive, blocking half his view. His nose is inches from where the metal triangle barely covers my—\n\n[Image: He takes a deep breath. SNIFF.\n\nHe takes a deep breath. SNIFF.\n\n\"Mmmmm.\" The sound vibrates against my inner thigh. \"Smell like a proper cunt now.\"\n\nThe shudder that runs through me is pure revulsion. The space between my legs clenches involuntarily, a muscular response I don't understand, don't WANT to understand. This body has reflexes, responses, that aren't mine.\n\nHe doesn't know what the collar is. I can see it in his yellow eyes—confusion mixed with glee. Something's whispering to him through it, guiding him, but he doesn't understand it any more than I do.\n\n\"It says yer mine now,\" he says, tapping the iron at my throat. \"But Says I get to play with ye however I want.\" Another squeeze of my tit, casual as breathing. \"And I wants to play slow. Real slow.\"\n\nHe steps back, hands on his hips, surveying me like a merchant examining goods.\n\nSomething materializes in his hand—a leather strap extending from the collar. A leash. Like I'm a fucking DOG.\n\nHis loincloth has shifted. What's underneath... Flux's bleeding balls, it's the size of my forearm. Purple-headed, visibly throbbing even through the ratty fabric. A wet spot spreading where the tip presses against the cloth. The smell hits me—concentrated piss mixed with something fungal, something that makes my nostrils burn and my head swim.\n\nI realize with crystal clarity what that thing is for. What it does. What goblins DO with captured women. The stories, the survivors found months later, swollen with goblin spawn...[[Image: The hatred in my eyes could melt iron.\n\nThe hatred in my eyes could melt iron. I stare up at this diseased piece of shit, this walking infection, this MISTAKE of nature that dares to stand over me.\n\n\"You're a fucking plague.\" The words tear from my throat, raw with fury. \"A disease that spreads through rape because you're too pathetic to breed your own women. You have to STEAL ours because even your own females would rather die than—\"\n\n\"HAHA!\" His laughter is wet, phlegmy. \"Mad that gobbo cock works better than human? Mad that yer women come back with green babies?\"\n\n\"You're parasites! Vermin! We burn your warrens for SPORT!\" I try to surge up but the collar keeps me pinned, a warning pressure. \"Every goblin I've killed—and I've killed DOZENS—died squealing like the pigs they—\"\n\n\"Ye killed me cousins. Me brothers.\" He's grinning but there's something else in those yellow eyes now. Not quite anger. Anticipation. \"The collar tells me things. Says ye were a big hero. Says ye have a wife—\"\n\n\"DON'T—\"\n\n\"Says ye were tryin' to make babies.\" His grin widens.\n\nHorror floods through me like ice water.\n\n\"See, I know how to break things proper.\" He releases my hair, stands up, adjusts that massive bulge in his loincloth. \"Slow-like. Could just mount ye right now, pump ye full of gobbo babies. But where's the fun?\"\n\nSomething materializes in his hand—a leather strap extending from the collar. A leash. Like I'm a fucking DOG.\n\n\"The collar says it's old magic. Older than yer kingdom. Turns enemies into...\" He licks his lips. \"Into whatever we want. And it says the best part is watchin' ye fight it while yer body learns what it's for.\"\n\n\"I'll find a way to kill you.\" My voice is breaking but the rage keeps building. \"You can't keep me on a leash forever, you diseased little—\"\n\n*YANK.*\n\nThe leash pulls taut. The collar digs into my throat, not choking but commanding. I have to lean forward or fall over.\n\n\"Up.\" One word. Not a request.\n\nI try to stand. Get halfway up, wobble, catch the wall. My tits swing forward and nearly spill free, and the heels won't let me plant my feet flat. This armor was forged for one purpose: to make the wearer kneel.\n\n\"Walk.\"\n\n*YANK.*\n\nI stumble forward. The metal spikes catch on stone—*CLACK CLACK CLACK*. Each step forces my hips to sway. My ass bounces. My tits jiggle. I'm a walking obscenity, and he's leading me like livestock.\n\nWe pass goblin corpses. My kills from today, or yesterday, whenever this nightmare started. He pauses at one, a big brute with his skull caved in.\n\n\"That's Gorthak. Had six kids.\" He spits on the corpse. \"Ye probably don't even remember killin' him.\"\n\nThey all look the same dead.\n\n\"Ye think we're nothing but animals.\" He starts walking again, forcing me to follow on these torture-spikes. \"Think we just rape and breed and die.\"\n\n\"You DO—\"\n\n\"We got culture. Gods. Stories.\" Another corpse. \"That's Snaggle. Best drummer in three tribes.\"\n\n\"I don't CARE—\"\n\n\"Course ye don't.\" We're heading toward daylight now. \"Humans never do. Just kill kill kill. Well, now ye get to see the other side.\"\n\nThe rage is eating me alive. I need to think. Can't attack him directly—the collar will kill me. But if someone else does it? If he has an accident? If—\n\nThat's when I see it.\n\nHis loincloth shifts as he walks, and in profile—\n\nEon's mercy.\n\nThe thing swinging between his legs is the size of my forearm. Purple-headed, veiny, already half-hard from Flux knows what. The smell hits me a second later—concentrated musk, like a stable that's never been mucked. My stomach turns but something else happens too. Something worse.\n\n[Choice: He notices you looking...",

A bead of something thick and white forms at the tip, soaking through, making the cloth transparent in that spot.\n\nMy throat closes. Not from the collar this time—from memory.\n\nThree summers ago. The Westfort raids. We found the missing maidens in a goblin warren, their bellies swollen with—\n\nNo.\n\nBut the thought won't leave. Those hollow eyes. The way they didn't want to be rescued. The way they begged to go back. \"Our babies,\" they'd said. \"Our masters need—\"\n\nVeteran soldiers would go quiet when someone jokes about goblin raids. Not because of the killing. Because of what comes after.\n\nThey breed our women.\n\n\"Hehehe.\" Snib scratches himself, the motion making that monster shift. \"Ye keep starin', jiggly-meat. Like what ye see?\"\n\n\"I'm not—\"\n\n\"Gonna be yer new favorite thing,\" He grins, showing those broken teeth. \"But not yet. Collar says slow. Says heroes need time to... marinate.\" He's proud of himself for using such a long word.\n\nHe reaches past me, grabs Whisperwind from the rubble. My sword in his filthy hands—he can barely lift it properly, has to use both arms, but he manages. Swings it experimentally like a child with a stick.\n\n\"Light for such a big sword.\" CLANG. He hits it against stone, giggling at the sound. \"This killed lots of goblins, eh? Now it's mine. Like you. Now - let's get home.\"\n\nHe tugs the leash. I'm forced to stand again, wobbling on these metal stakes.\n\n\"Gonna be yer Master now. Teach ye proper.\" Another tug. Forward.\n\n*CLOP.*\n\nThe first step in the metal heels echoes through the cavern like a bell tolling. My ankle immediately rolls. The leash goes taut, keeping me from falling.\n\n\"Heh. Swing them hips, hero.\"\n\n*CLOP. CLOP.*\n\nEach step forces my hips to sway like a whore working a room. The heels demand it—there's no other way to balance. And everything follows a heartbeat late: tits hitting their peak after my footfall, ass rolling a half-second behind that, the whole body a cascade of flesh I can't control and can't stop watching.\n\n\"Better!\" He's delighted, swinging Whisperwind at cobwebs as we walk. \"Look at that arse move! Like two pigs fighting in a sack!\"\n\nThe mine tunnels seem endless. Every twenty feet he yanks the leash to \"correct\" my walk. More hip. More bounce.\n\n\"Soon ye'll be calling me Master and likin' it,\" he says conversationally, using MY sword to knock a loose stone. \"Gonna have so much fun, you and me. Me hut needs cleaning. Me balls need draining. And ye've got all the right parts now.\"\n\nBy the time we see daylight, my legs are shaking. Late afternoon sun streams through the mine entrance. How long was I unconscious? How long has Elara been—\n\n\"Get down.\"\n\nHis voice changes. Sharp. Serious.\n\nI follow his gaze. Three figures approach on the road—miners by their gear, probably coming for afternoon shift after what I told Mayor Bramble. They haven't seen us yet, but they will in moments.\n\n\"Behind them rocks. NOW.\"\n\nHe yanks me behind a cluster of boulders. We crouch—or I try to. These tits make it awkward, pressing against my thighs. The metal barely covering me digs in everywhere.\n\n\"Listen good, hero-cunt.\" His breath is hot on my ear, reeking of rot. \"They see us, it's over. No more slow breaking. I'll mount ye right here in the dirt like the cow ye are. Breed ye while they watch. That what ye want?\"\n\nThe miners are closer. I can hear their voices now.\n\n\"—told us it would be clear by now—\"\n\n\"—Aldric never fails—\"\n\nAldric. They're talking about me. About how I promised the mine would be safe.\n\nEvery fiber of my being screams to call out. These are my people. Humans. They could help, could kill this creature, could—\n\nBut Snib's threat isn't empty. I can see it in his yellow eyes.\n\nThe miners are twenty feet away. Fifteen. I can see their faces now—Hedric, Bors, young Timothy who just started last month.",

Their hands go to their picks.\n\nSnib snarls and YANKS the leash so hard I'm pulled backward, tits flying up into my face before I crash onto my ass. The metal spikes scrape stone as I scramble.\n\n\"*Grashk! Mortuk! Kregga nas velim!*\" Snib shouts in that chittering tongue, his voice carrying. \"*Humies! Kill!

They think—of course they think there are more.\n\n\"Please!\" I sob, reaching toward them even as Snib's foot plants on my back. \"Please, I'm—there's just one! Just him! PLEASE!\"\n\nBut they're already backing away. Hedric's got his pick raised. Bors is pulling young Timothy back.\n\n\"Timothy!\" The name tears from my throat. He trained under me last summer. Learned the Third Guard position. \"Timothy, it's—\"\n\nThe collar CONSTRICTS.\n\nNot gradually. Instantly. My words become a strangled wheeze. Black spots dance across my vision as Snib's hand comes down on my ass with a ringing CRACK that echoes off the mine entrance.\n\n\"Bad cow!\" He spanks me again, harder, making a show of it. The miners can see everything—this tiny goblin dominating what looks like a captive woman. \"Trying to trick nice humans! Bad!\"\n\nHe recognizes something. Not me—he could never recognize me like this. But the humanity. The desperation.\n\n\"We should—\" he starts.\n\n\"It's a trap, boy!\" Hedric grabs his arm. \"You know what they do! Use the women as bait after they've—after they're broken!\"\n\n\"But what if—\"\n\n\"You heard him call for others! There's probably dozens in there!\"\n\nSnib grins at them, gives my ass another theatrical CRACK. \"This one's trained good! Watch!\" He tugs the leash and I'm forced to my knees, gasping as the collar loosens just enough to let me breathe. \"See? Broken proper!\"\n\n\"Aldric said he'd clear them out,\" Bors mutters, already backing toward the road. \"Must've... must've failed. Or died.\"\n\n\"No...\" The word comes out as a whisper. They can't hear it. \"No, I'm... I'm right here...\"\n\nBut Timothy's already being dragged away. Our eyes meet for one horrible moment—his full of pity for what he thinks is some ruined woman, mine full of desperate recognition he'll never understand.\n\n[Image: They run.\n\nThey run.\n\nActually run. Three grown men with picks, running from one goblin. Their boots thunder on the road, getting quieter, quieter, gone. Hedric's lantern abandoned in the dirt. Bors's mining helmet rolled into the ditch.\n\n[Choice: Silence...]My mouth opens. The scream builds in my chest, pressing against my ribs like a caged beast.\n\n*Help me. HELP ME. I'M RIGHT HERE.*\n\nBut nothing comes out. Not even a whisper.\n\nBecause I can feel the collar waiting. Cold iron pressed against my throat like a blade's edge, ready to crush my windpipe the moment I disobey. And worse—I can see the promise in Snib's yellow eyes.\n\nThe miners trudge past, boots crunching gravel. So close I can smell the coal dust on them, the honest sweat of working men. Hedric's discussing overtime pay. Bors mentions his wife's stew. Timothy—sweet, eager Timothy who just learned to hold a blade two months ago—is humming some tavern song off-key.\n\nTwenty feet. Fifteen. Ten.\n\nSnib's warty hand slides over the swell of my ass, fingers sinking deep into the soft flesh. Not groping—*owning*. His thumb traces the line where cheek meets thigh, that crease that shouldn't exist on Aldric's body but does on mine. I can feel him grinning behind me as his fingers explore, marking his territory while my people walk by, oblivious.\n\n[Image: 'Good girl. Keeping quiet like a proper cow.'\n\n\"Good girl,\" he whispers, breath hot and rotten against my ear. \"Keeping quiet like a proper cow.\"\n\nEight feet. I can see Timothy's profile. There's dirt under his fingernails. A new scar on his jaw from practice. He's grown since summer.\n\nMy heart hammers so hard I'm sure they'll hear it. These massive tits heave with each desperate breath, threatening to spill from their metal triangles. Sweat pools between them, runs down my stomach.\n\nFive feet.\n\nThey pass.\n\nTheir voices fade down the tunnel, echoing off stone until even that dies. The last sound is Timothy's humming, growing distant, gone.\n\n\"See?\" Snib releases my ass with a wet pat that makes the flesh jiggle. \"Ye can be trained. Thought maybe I'd have to break ye fast, all at once. Boring.\" He stands, yanking the leash to make me follow. \"But ye showed ye can obey. Makes things more fun.\"\n\nMy legs shake as I rise on these torture-spikes. The collar hasn't tightened, but I can still feel its threat. Like a hand hovering over my throat, ready to squeeze.\n\n\"Collar knows ye're learning,\" he says, leading me away from the mine entrance. \"Says the slow way is best. Heroes always think they'll find a way out. Makes it sweeter when they realize they won't.\"\n\nWe don't take the main road. Of course not. Snib tugs me toward a gap in the treeline—barely a deer trail, choked with undergrowth.\n\n\"Can't have more humans seein' us,\" he explains, using Whisperwind to hack at low branches. My sword, reduced to a machete. \"Not yet. Not till ye're proper broke.\"\n\nThe first step into the forest loam is disaster.\n\nMy heel-spike punches straight through the soft earth, sinking three inches deep. When I try to pull it free, the mud sucks at it with an obscene *SCHLOOORP*. My weight shifts forward, tits swinging like grain sacks, throwing me off balance. The other heel sinks.\n\n\"HAHA!\" Snib's laughter could strip bark from trees. \"Look at ye! Like a cow stuck in mud!\"\n\nI wrench one foot free, stumble forward, sink again. Each step is a battle—the heels punching through leaf litter and soft soil, my ankles rolling, these weights on my chest swaying violently. The metal thong rides up with each high step, cutting between my cheeks like cheese wire.\n\n*SQUELCH-CLOP.* Pull foot free.\n*WOBBLE.* Tits swing left.\n*SQUELCH-CLOP.* Other foot sinks.\n*WOBBLE.* Tits swing right.\n\n\"Ye walked through here this morning, didn't ye?\" Snib calls back, still giggling. \"Bet it was easier with a cock and proper boots!\"\n\nA root catches my heel. I go down hard, my tits literally slapping together with a meaty CLAP that echoes through the trees. Wet leaves stick to my skin. The position—on my knees in the dirt while this creature laughs at me—makes bile rise in my throat.\n\n[Image: 'Up, cow! We got distance to cover.'\n\n\"Up, cow! We got distance to cover.\"\n\nI struggle upright, now covered in forest filth. My hair—this long, silky hair that isn't mine—has twigs in it. There's mud on my thighs. These metal cups are full of dead leaves.\n\n[Choice: Continue through the forest...]",

Shafts of golden light pierce through like temple windows, illuminating clouds of pollen that drift like fairy dust. Beautiful. Serene. Everything I'm not.\n\n*SQUELCH-CLOP.*\n\nMy heel tears free from mud with the sound of a wet kiss. The other sinks immediately. My tits—Flux's balls, these things weigh like millstones—swing forward with such momentum I nearly topple. Have to throw my arms out for balance, which makes them swing again, which makes me stumble, which—\n\n\"Hurry up, tit-slave!\" Snib yanks the leash. \"We got ground to cover before dark!\"\n\nSomething shifts in the boots. The spikes... flatten? Not completely, but enough that I'm not punching holes in the earth with each step. My calves still scream from the angle, tendons stretched like bowstrings, but at least I can walk. Sort of.\n\nThe armor obeys him. Of course it does.\n\n\"That's better!\" He scampers ahead, then circles back around me, literally dancing in circles while I trudge. \"Look at ye go! Swing them hips! Make them udders bounce!\"\n\n[Image: He's back to using the leash...\n\nA woodpecker hammers somewhere above. The normal forest sounds—birds, insects, the whisper of wind through pine needles—all continue like nothing's wrong. Like the world hasn't ended. Like I'm not being led through my homeland on a leash by something I've killed hundreds of.\n\n\"Humans love to step on goblins,\" Snib chatters, skipping backward in front of me so he can watch my tits bounce with each step. \"Squish us like bugs. Call us vermin. Monsters.\" His grin widens. \"But I got meself a HERO! Wait till the Gobboree! They'll shit themselves!\"\n\nI stare straight ahead. Don't engage. Don't react. Just walk. One foot. Other foot. Ignore how my thighs rub together, how this metal strap saws between my ass cheeks, how my hair—so much thrashing hair—sticks to the sweat on my back.\n\n\"The collar's tellin' me things,\" Snib continues, now walking sideways like a crab to keep watching me. \"About you. Aldric. AL-DRIC.\" He sounds it out like he's tasting something exotic. \"Stupid name. Hero name. Not yer name anymore.\"\n\n[Image: The river runs dark as its name suggests—not from filth but from tannins leached from pine roots, the water like weak tea.\n\nWe reach the Pitchwater an hour in. The river runs dark as its name suggests—not from filth but from tannins leached from pine roots, the water like weak tea. Kingfishers dive for silver fish that flash in the amber depths. An otter watches us from a fallen log, whiskers twitching, before sliding silently away.\n\nI know this spot. Elara and I picnicked here last spring. She wore that yellow dress that made her skin glow. We made love in the ferns while dragonflies danced overhead.\n\n)[[Image: We made love in the ferns while dragonflies danced overhead.\n[[Image: We made love in the ferns while dragonflies danced overhead.\n\nNow I'm being led past it in chains and slutwear.\n\n\"Collar says yer name is Elise now.\" Snib splashes through the shallows while I have to pick my way across stepping stones, each wobbling step threatening to spill me into the water. \"EL-EEE-SEE. Pretty name for a pretty thing.\"\n\n\"That's not my name.\" First words I've spoken in an hour. They come out in this musical feminine voice that makes me want to scream.\n\n\"Is now!\" He cackles. \"Collar picked it special. Says it means something in the old tongue. Something about...\" He frowns, concentrating. \"Don't matter. Point is, ye're Elise. My Elise. My bouncy, jiggly, tit-heavy Elise!\"\n\nThe forest gives way to wetland as we follow the river. Cypress trees rise from standing water, their knees poking up like ancient bones. Moss drapes everything in green curtains. A heron watches us pass with one golden eye, neck coiled to strike at fish.\n\nMy heels sink into the spongy ground with each step. The sucking sounds—SCHLORP, SCHLORP—are obscene in the marsh quiet. Mud splatters up my legs. The weight on my chest never rests—each step launches a chain reaction of bounce and sway, the flesh colliding with soft meaty claps that make Snib giggle like a child watching puppets.\n\n\"Learned magic, didn't ye?\" He's walking on a fallen log like it's a balance beam while I struggle through the muck below. \"Smart humie. Fire and ice and wind.\" He jumps down, lands in front of me. \"But ye can't use 'em without my say-so now.

Maybe even let ye fight for me, earn some gold!\"\n\n[Image: The marshland gives way to scrub, then sand.\n\nThe sun drops lower. The marshland gives way to scrub, then sand. The desert spreads before us, still radiating heat from the day. My feet are raw inside the metal boots. My calves cramp with every step. My back aches from the weight on my chest. Everything hurts.\n\nAnd still Snib talks.\n\n\"Never been the luckiest goblin,\" he admits, leading me up a dune. \"Tribe kicked me out. Said I was too small, even for a gob. But look at me now! Got the mighty Aldric on a leash! Gonna be rich! RICH!\"\n\nI stumble. Fall to my knees in the sand. My tits swing forward and actually hit the ground, sending up little puffs of dust. Kneeling in sand while this creature holds my leash, my tits dragging in the dirt. I want to die.\n\n\"Up, cow! Almost home!\"\n\nI could have called to the miners. Should have. They would have helped. Three men with picks against one goblin. But I was a coward.

      "text": "The hut squats against a dead olive tree like a boil on diseased flesh. Mud-brick walls lean drunkenly, patched with dung and what might be bones. The thatched roof sags in the middle, held up by stolen planks that still have Eboncrest mill-marks on them. This is where I'm supposed to live now. This shit-heap.\n\n\"Home sweet home!\" Snib announces, yanking me through the doorway that's so low I have to duck, making my tits swing and slap together.\n\nThe stench hits like a physical blow.\n\nThis nose is better than Aldric's. MUCH better. I can pick apart the layers — dried cum on the furs, sennights of it. Piss soaked into the mud-brick. Rotting meat from that pot in the corner. And underneath, something musky and alive that bypasses my brain entirely and goes straight to my cunt.\n\nMy skin crawls. My thighs press tighter together.\n\n\"That's Jarkrond!\" Snib points to a desert horse tied outside—massive grey beast with yellow eyes and scars covering its flanks. The thing's cock is half-dropped from its sheath, pink and mottled. \"Watch out, he's randy! Tries to mount anything with a cunt! HAHA!\"\n\nInside is worse than I imagined. One room, maybe twenty feet across. A pile of stained furs in one corner that must be his bed—they're crusty with Flux knows what. A smaller pile of straw that's brown with age. One wooden plate, cracked. One cup. A pot with something growing inside it.\n\nAnd trophies.\n\nWomen's smallclothes nailed to the walls. A lock of red hair tied in a knot. A broken doll that's been used for... I can't look at it.\n\n[Image: Inside is worse than I imagined.\n\nMy sword. Whisperwind. The blade that's tasted dragon blood now leans against mud brick, already gathering dust. My chest tightens seeing it there. That sword is MINE. Forged for my hand. Blessed by the Ephemerals. Now it's just another trophy in this cesspit.\n\n\"Hungry!\" Snib announces, pulling something from a clay pot. It's meat, maybe. Grey-green, with maggots writhing through it. He tears off a chunk with his teeth, juice running down his chin. \"Aged rabbit! Three sennights old! Want some?\"\n\nI gag.\n\n\"No? More fer me!\" He talks while chewing, showing the rotting meat mulching between his broken teeth. \"So here's how it works, tit-slave. Yer gonna clean this place up nice. See that broom? That's yer new best friend. Well outside fer water—old thing, been here forever. Some kind of ancient stone well. Works though!\"\n\nHe points to the straw pile. \"That's where ye sleep. Right there where I can see ye. Keep an eye on me property.\"\n\n[Image: 'That's where ye sleep. Right there where I can see ye. Keep an eye on me property.'\n\nProperty. The word makes my hands clench into fists.\n\n\"Tomorrow ye start earnin' yer keep proper. But tonight...\" He grins, those yellow eyes traveling down my body with ownership. \"Tonight I just wanna look at what I got. Turn around. Slow.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Turn.\" The collar tightens slightly. A warning.\n\nI turn, burning with shame, my heels scraping the dirt floor. Can feel his eyes on every inch—the way my ass cheeks swallow the metal thong, how my tits sway with the motion, the red marks where the armor cuts into soft flesh.\n\n\"Got meself a woman,\" he mutters, almost amazed. \"A proper breeding-age human woman. Been so long since...\" He trails off, adjusting the massive bulge in his loincloth. \"Tribe always said I was too small to get a proper humie mate. But look now! Got the best one! A HERO-CUNT!\"\n\n\"I'm not your woman.\" The words come out strangled with rage.\n\n\"Sure ye are! Gonna make me rich, ye are.\" He scratches his balls thoughtfully as he starts a fire. \"Might keep ye longer. Yer gonna clean, cook once I teach ye how. Maybe even let ye use that sword again, fight for me! Earn gold that way too!\"\n\nMy heart leaps at the mention of using Whisperwind again, then crashes when I realize it would be in HIS service.\n\n\"And that wife of yers...\" He grins wider. \"Elara. Pretty name. Red hair, the collar says. Nice round arse, though the tits aren't as big as yers now. Bet she's wondering where her big strong husband went.\"\n\nNo. No no no—\n\n\"Maybe we visit sometime! They won't kill me if ye protect me. Maybe I'll convince her to join us. Two cunts for the price of one! If ye just explain real nice how good I treat ye—\"\n\n\"You fucking PARASITE!\" The rage explodes out of me. \"You disgusting, shit-eating, worthless—\"\n\nHe laughs at my fury.\n\n\"Listen to that voice! All high and pretty! Even when yer angry ye sound like a songbird!\" He walks closer, having to crane his neck to look up at my face. \"Here's the thing, cow-tits. Ye're gonna make my life good. Real good. To make up for all them goblins ye killed. And soon enough...\"\n\nHe reaches out and cups my pussy through the metal thong. Just cups it, like he's weighing fruit at market.\n\n\"Soon ye'll be servicin' me proper. Suckin' this—\" He grabs his bulge with his other hand. \"Drainin' these balls daily. Maybe hourly once ye get a taste for it.\"\n\nI jerk back, shaking. Every muscle coiled to strike. To grab Whisperwind and run him through, collar be damned. Maybe it won't kill me. Maybe it's a bluff. Maybe—\n\n\"But I'm patient,\" Snib continues, settling onto his pile of furs with a contented sigh. \"Won't force nothin'. Long as yer a good slave, make my life better, the entertainment of havin' ye around is enough. For now.\"\n\nHe pulls his loincloth aside to \"adjust\" himself, giving me a full view of that purple monstrosity. The head is the size of my fist, already weeping clear fluid. The smell of it fills the hut—rotten fish and cheese and something that makes my head swim.\n\n\"Look at ye shakin'!\" He's delighted. \"The great Aldric, scared of goblin cock! Don't worry, ye'll learn to love it. They all do. Eventually.\"\n\nTears prick at my eyes. Actual tears. I haven't cried since my mother died, and now I'm about to sob in front of this creature.\n\nThis is my life now. This stinking hut. This disgusting creature pawing at me. My sword just out of reach. My wife miles away, probably crying herself to sleep wondering where I am.\n\nI'm going to kill him. Collar or no collar, I'm going to—\n\n[Choice: Grab Whisperwind and attack!",

The weight settles into my bones like coming home. Thirty inches of skyforged steel sings as I lift it—a smooth draw that flows like water finding its course. The blade catches the dirty lamplight and throws it back clean, pure, *hungry*.\n\nWhisperwind knows me. Through the soft flesh, through these wrong curves—the star-sapphires in the crossguard pulse once, twice, like a heartbeat resuming. The sword recognizes the hand that has fed it blood for seventeen years.\n\nAnd it knows what needs doing.\n\nThe collar tightens—ice-cold iron crushing my throat—but I don't care. Black spots dance at my vision's edge but my grip stays true. These heels dig into the dirt floor, finding purchase. My stance widens to compensate for the weight on my chest, these massive tits that pull me forward. My thighs burn as I coil for the strike.\n\nSnib's yellow eyes go wide. Real fear now. Not the calculating wariness from before but the pure animal terror of prey recognizing death's arrival. He scrambles backward, trips over his own cooking pot, lands on his warty ass.\n\n\"Wait—\"\n\nWhisperwind describes the perfect arc. The Ninth Guard transitioning to Reaper's Fall—muscle memory older than thought. The sword whispers through air that seems to thicken with anticipation. This is the strike that split the basilisk's skull. That opened the throat of the Thuulk Strangler. That has ended a hundred monsters and will end one more—\n\nThe blade stops.\n\nHangs frozen in treasonous air.\n\nTwo feet from Snib's head, Whisperwind hangs frozen in space like it's struck an invisible wall. My arms shake with the effort of trying to complete the strike. Veins stand out on my forearms. These tits heave with each desperate breath. But the sword won't move. Can't move.\n\nThe collar's command is absolute.\n\n\"AHAHAHA!\" Snib's laughter explodes out of him as he realizes he's not about to die. \"Oh, that was good! Real good! Ye almost had me!\"\n\nMy arms give out. Whisperwind falls from nerveless fingers, hitting the dirt with a sound like my heart breaking. The beautiful blade lies there, still gleaming with righteous fury, wanting so badly to complete its purpose. To do what it was made for. To protect the innocent by ending the guilty.\n\nBut I can't pick it up again. My hands won't obey.\n\nSnib stands, brushing dirt off his ass. Then, grinning that broken-glass grin, he reaches down and loosens his loincloth completely.\n\nHis cock springs free.\n\n\"Ye know what?\" He wraps his warty fingers around the shaft. \"That deserves punishment.\"\n\n\"Don't—\" The word comes out as a whisper.\n\nHe starts stroking. Slow. Deliberate. His cock hardens with each pump, going from its already-massive flaccid state to something truly monstrous. Twelve inches of purple-headed breeding meat, thick as my wrist—my old wrist—with veins like rope running along its length.\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*\n\nThe sound fills the hut. Wet. Obscene. His precum starts flowing immediately, drooling from the slit in thick strings that stretch toward the floor.\n\n\"Look at me,\" he commands, still stroking. \"LOOK AT ME, hero.\"\n\nI can't look away. This tiny creature, barely reaching my waist, is standing here jerking his massive cock while I kneel helpless. The smell of it—rotted fish and cheese—makes my eyes water.\n\n\"Yer whole legacy,\" *SCHLICK-SCHLICK* \"All them monsters ye killed,\" *SCHLICK-SCHLICK* \"Don't mean shit now.\"\n\n[Image: Tears run down my face. Ugly, humiliating tears...\n\nTears run down my face. Ugly, humiliating tears that drip off my chin onto these massive tits.\n\nHe circles me, cock in hand, precum leaving a trail on the floor. The head is purple-dark, flared like a mushroom, angry-looking. His balls swing heavy between his legs, covered in wiry black hair, each one the size of a large apple.\n\n\"Ye're nothing now. Just tits and holes.\" He stops in front of Whisperwind, propping it up, still pumping. \"And this sword? Yer precious blade?\"\n\n\"No.\" Horror floods through me as I understand. \"No, don't—please—\"\n\n[Image: 'No, don't—please—'",

Animal.\n\n\"Here it comes,\" he grunts. \"Here comes yer new reality!\"\n\nI squeeze my eyes shut. Turn my head away. I can't watch this. I won't.\n\nThe sound is worse than watching would be. That wet SPLAT of something heavy and viscous hitting metal. Whisperwind actually RINGS from the impact—a pure note corrupted into something sick. The smell hits immediately—rotten cheese mixed with dead fish mixed with something sweet-sick that makes my stomach clench.\n\n\"LOOK AT IT!\" Snib roars. \"LOOK AT YER—UNGH!\"\n\n[Image: Not... looking...\n\nAnother wet impact. Heavier. I can hear it splashing, dripping. The sound of thick liquid hitting metal and stone. My whole body shudders. This can't be happening. This three-foot creature can't be—\n\nThis one sounds different. Pressurized at first, then a horrible wet GLOP like porridge being poured from height. The stench intensifies—now I understand what that smell in the hut was. Old cum. Everywhere. And now fresh cum, hot enough I can feel the warmth of it from here.\n\n\"This is—UNGH—what heroes—FUCK—are worth!\"\n\nMultiple impacts now. Different directions. I hear cum hitting the wall, the floor, but mostly—mostly my sword. That beautiful blade that's saved my life a hundred times, now being defiled by—\n\nI whimper like a frightened girl. The sound escapes before I can stop it.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right! Whimper for me, cow-tits! Yer sword's getting BAPTIZED!\"\n\nThis goes on forever. Three seconds, maybe four, of continuous wet sound. Like someone pouring thick stew but wrong, so wrong. I can hear it pooling, dripping, the obscene weight of it. Snib's grunting like a rutting boar, his breath coming in sharp gasps.\n\n\"Cock-snot for the hero's sword! Goblin nut-butter! Ball-sludge! This is what yer worth now!\"\n\nThe final spurts. Each one accompanied by a grunt of satisfaction. Then silence except for dripping. Constant dripping. Plop. Plop. Plop.\n\n\"Open yer eyes, cow. Look what I done.\"\n\nI don't want to. But the collar tightens slightly—a warning—and I open them.\n\nWhisperwind is unrecognizable.\n\n[Image: Thick ropes of cum crisscross the blade like spider silk made of custard.\n\nYellow-white sludge covers it from pommel to point. Thick ropes of cum crisscross the blade like spider silk made of custard. Chunks of something white float in the yellow-grey slime. The crossguard is completely obscured by a thick glob that hangs down in obscene stalactites. The leather grip is soaked, stained.\n\nSnib shakes his cock, still semi-hard, droplets flying. One hits my bare thigh and burns like acid.\n\n\"There we go,\" he pants, satisfied. \"Now it's mine. Like you.\"\n\nI'm sobbing. Ugly, body-shaking sobs that make these massive tits heave and bounce. Whisperwind lies there, drowning in goblin cum that fills the entire hut with its presence—that rotten fish and cheese stench that makes me gag.\n\n\"See that?\" Snib tucks his still-dripping cock back into his loincloth where it makes an obscene tent. \"That's yer future, cow-tits. Whatever I want to cum on, I cum on. Whatever I want to own, I own. And right now?\"]His balls draw up tight against his body, the wrinkled sack contracting like a fist. His cock flexes—actually FLEXES like a muscle—and the head flares even wider, purple-dark like a bruised plum about to burst.\n\n\"Here it comes,\" he grunts, eyes rolling back. \"Here comes yer new reality!\"\n\nThe first rope erupts with the force of a crossbow bolt. It's not liquid—it's almost solid, a thumb-thick cable of yellow-white sludge that arcs through the air and SLAPS across Whisperwind's blade with an audible splat. The sword actually rings from the impact, a pure note corrupted.\n\n[Image: I can't look away.\n\nI can't look away. I'm transfixed by the sheer wrongness of it—this three-foot creature producing more cum than should be physically possible, his cock jumping with each pulse like it's trying to escape his body.\n\nThe second rope is even thicker. Custard-dense, with visible chunks of something white floating in the yellow-grey slime. It coils around the crossguard like a living thing, dripping down in obscene stalactites. The smell hits me—rotten cheese mixed with dead fish mixed with something sweet and wrong that makes my head swim.\n\n\"LOOK AT IT!\" Snib roars, his whole body convulsing. \"LOOK AT YER PRECIOUS BLADE!\"\n\nThis one comes out in stages—first a pressurized jet, then a thick glob that hangs from his cockhead on a two-foot string before splattering onto the fuller. The cum is HOT. I can see steam rising from it in the cool desert night. It's chunky like porridge that's been left out, with a skin forming on top that breaks when the next rope hits.\n\n\"This is—UNGH—what heroes—FUCK—are worth!\" Each word punctuated by another disgusting ejaculation. His cock doesn't just shoot—it VOMITS cum, retching up impossible amounts.\n\nMultiple streams now, spraying in different directions but all finding Whisperwind. One rope hits the pommel, another coats the leather grip, a third draws a line down the entire length of the blade. The cum is so thick it doesn't run off—it CLINGS, like melted cheese, forming bridges between different parts of the sword.\n\nThe goblin's face is pure ecstasy. This tiny, warty creature with a cock that belongs on a breeding bull, his yellow eyes locked on mine as he defiles everything I am. His mouth hangs open, black tongue lolling out, drool mixing with snot as he grunts like a rutting animal.\n\nThe biggest yet. A continuous stream that lasts three full seconds, hosing down the blade like he's pissing but thicker, chunkier. I can hear it hitting the metal—SPLAT-SPLAT-SPLAT-SPLAT—each impact another nail in the coffin of my dignity.\n\n\"Cock-snot for the hero's sword!\" He's laughing and cumming at the same time. \"Goblin nut-butter! Ball-sludge! This is what yer worth now!\"\n\nThe final spurts come in waves, each one punctuated by his whole body jerking. His cock flexes so hard it slaps against his belly between shots, leaving snail-trails of cum on his own warty skin. The last rope is almost pure white, thick as custard, and it lands directly on the star-sapphires in the crossguard.\n\nThey go dark.\n\nSnib shakes his cock, sending droplets flying. One hits my cheek—hot and thick, burning like acid. He's still semi-hard, the head still drooling cum in a continuous stream that forms a puddle on the dirt floor.\n\n\"There we go,\" he pants, satisfied. \"Now it's mine. Like you.\"\n\nI'm sobbing. Ugly, body-shaking sobs that make these massive tits bounce. Whisperwind lies there, drowning in goblin cum that steams in the lamplight, the stench filling the entire hut with its presence.\n\n[Image: Thick ropes of cum crisscross the blade like spider silk made of custard.\n\n\"See that?\" Snib tucks his still-dripping cock back into his loincloth where it makes an obscene bulge. \"That's yer future, cow-tits.

Where each rope of seed touches the skyforged steel, the metal darkens like infection spreading through a wound. The blade's natural iridescence—that shift from blue to silver to violet—dims and dies, replaced by the flat black of burned iron. The corruption spreads outward from each point of contact, veins of darkness racing along the fuller.\n\n\"No...\" The word comes out broken.\n\nThe star-sapphires in the crossguard, which have pulsed with inner light since before memory, crack with sounds like breaking teeth. Their celestial blue leaks out like blood, replaced by the dull red of dried scabs, before disappearing entirely. The runes of wind along the blade—those promises and threats carved by storm-smiths—writhe and reshape themselves into the same twisted script that marks my collar.\n\n[Image: Whisperwind is dying, and I'm watching it happen.\n\nThe leather grip, worn smooth by my palm over seventeen years, darks to black and cracks like dried skin.

The perfect balance destroyed. The weight wrong in my palm for the first time in seventeen years—too light, too short, sized for the hands I have now.\n\nAnd then, across the crossguard in blocky, mocking script, letters burn themselves into the metal:\n\n**ELISE - GOBLIN-OWNED HERO**\n\n\"AHAHAHA!\" Snib's laughter could strip paint. \"Look at that!

Seventeen years that blade has been part of me. My identity. My purpose. The extension of my will made steel.\n\nWhisperwind's power has decreased.]Now it's just another thing Snib has taken from me.\n\n\"Here's the deal, cow-tits.\" He stretches out on his pile of crusty furs, hands behind his head, cock still making an obscene tent in his loincloth. \"Ten thousand gold. That's yer price.\"\n\nI look up through tears, snot running from my nose.\n\n\"Make me rich—ten thousand gold—and I'll let ye go. Easy as that.\"\n\n\"You're... you're lying.\" My voice comes out small, broken.\n\n\"Can't lie to ye direct, actually. Collar won't let me. No point anyway.\" He yawns, showing all those broken teeth. \"Ten thousand gold and yer free. That's the deal.\"\n\nTen thousand. I have that. It's in the bank at Eboncrest. Every copper I've saved over seventeen years of monster-slaying. Meant to provide for Elara and our children. The children we were trying so hard to—\n\n\"But first,\" Snib continues, already drowsing, \"ye clean up me hut. Tomorrow. Make it nice for once. Then maybe we visit that wife of yers...\"\n\n\"No.\" The word tears from my throat.\n\n\"Oh yes. She needs to see what her big strong husband's become. Maybe she'll want to join ye. Two wives better than one, eh?\" He's drifting off, not even worried about me attacking him in his sleep. Why would he be? The collar won't let me hurt him. Won't let me run. Won't let me do anything but obey.\n\n\"Sleep on the straw there,\" he mumbles, half-asleep. \"Where I can see ye. Guard me property...\"\n\nThen he's snoring, a wet, rattling sound like someone drowning in phlegm.\n\nI look around the disgusting hut that's now my prison. The pile of brown, rotting straw that's supposed to be my bed. It probably has fleas. Or worse. The stench of cum and piss and rotting meat so thick I can taste it. The women's smallclothes nailed to the walls like trophies. The broken doll with its hollow eyes.\n\nAnd Whisperwind. My beautiful blade, reduced to a cum-stained parody of itself, the metal still steaming where goblin seed eats into its soul. The inscription mocking me in the lamplight: ELISE - GOBLIN-OWNED HERO.\n\nI crawl to the straw on hands and knees because I don't trust myself to walk in these heels. My tits drag along the dirt floor, the metal triangles collecting filth. The pile is worse up close—stained with Eon knows what, crawling with small things that scatter when I approach.\n\nBut I'm too broken to care.\n\nI collapse onto it, these massive tits making it impossible to lie on my stomach, forcing me onto my side where they stack on top of each other like obscene pillows. The straw pokes through the gaps in my armor, scratching at soft skin that shouldn't exist.\n\nFrom here I can see everything. Snib sleeping without a care, his massive cock still half-hard and tenting his loincloth. Whisperwind dying in its pool of cum. The door that I can't walk through. The life I can't get back.\n\nYou're on the verge of a mental breakdown... steel your mind![Minigame]",

Let him believe his victory is complete.\n\nI've played dead for basilisks. I can play slave for a goblin.\n\nTomorrow begins the campaign. Patience instead of swords. Endurance instead of magic. Every hero's tale has its darkest hour—this is mine. Dawn always comes.\n\n[Image: The hay reeks of horse piss and mold.\n\nThe hay reeks of horse piss and mold. I scoop out the worst of it—black with rot, crawling with beetles—and drag over fresher stuff from the half-bale in the corner. Still straw. Still disgusting.

The armor cuts into me everywhere—metal triangles bisecting nipples that have gone hard in the desert cold, the thong so far up my ass it might be exploring my spine. Every breath makes the scales dig deeper.\n\nBut taking it off means being naked. In front of him. Giving in.\n\n[Image: Still straw. Still disgusting. But dry, at least.",

The triangular cups shift, crushing one nipple while the other pops free. I try to adjust but that makes the thong saw deeper between my cheeks.\n\nThese tits are too heavy. On my back, they fall sideways into my armpits, the metal edges cutting into the soft flesh beneath. I try my side—they stack on top of each other, the bottom one going numb immediately while the top one tries to escape its prison.\n\nThe boots are the worst. My feet scream inside them, toes crushed into points, calves locked in permanent spasm. But they won't come off. When I reach for the buckles, they're not where they should be. The metal has sealed itself.\n\nFine. FINE.\n\nI curl into a ball, knees up, these massive udders compressed between my thighs and chest. The hay pokes through every gap in the armor—my sides, my back, the exposed curves of my ass. Something with too many legs crawls across my thigh.\n\nSleep. Just sleep. Tomorrow I'll figure out the rest.]Fuck it. I can't sleep like this.\n\nMy fingers find the clasps—except they're not where they were before. The bikini top has hidden its releases under the flesh of my breasts. I have to lift each heavy tit to find the tiny mechanisms underneath, my fingers slipping on sweat.\n\n*Click.*\n\nThe metal springs away and my tits DROP. Free fall. They hit my ribs with an actual slap, then spread outward like dough on a baker's table. For the first time, I see them without the armor's constraint.\n\n[Image: Pale. Massive. Capped with nipples the size of gold coins.\n\nThe aureoles—those darker circles I remember from whores' tits—are wider than my palm. Everything bounces when I breathe. When I shift to pull off the thong, they roll and resettle like water finding its level.\n\n[Image: When I finally work it free and peel the metal away from my pussy, strings of clear liquid stretch between the metal and my flesh.\n\nThe thong's clasp hides at the base of my spine. When I finally work it free and peel the metal away from my pussy, strings of clear liquid stretch between the metal and my flesh. They snap with tiny wet sounds.\n\nI don't think about what that means. I won't.\n\nThe boots come off last. My fingers shake as I find the hidden catches behind my calves. When the metal finally releases—\n\n\"Unhhhh...\"\n\nThe moan escapes before I can stop it. My feet uncurl for the first time in hours. Blood rushes back. The relief is so intense my eyes water. My toes spread in the dirty air, tendons popping, muscles unknotting.\n\n[Image: My feet uncurl for the first time in hours.\n\nNaked now except for the collar. I curl on my side in the straw, these absurd tits stacked like obscene pillows. The bottom one goes numb. The top one's nipple grazes the hay, sending unwanted shivers through me. My thighs press together, hiding that soft nothing between them. My ass—there's so much of it—spreads behind me.\n\nSnib snores on, oblivious. At least there's that.\n\nThe straw scratches everywhere it touches. My skin, soft and thin now, feels every piece. Something crawls across my hip. The desert cold seeps in without the metal to trap my body heat.\n\nTime to pray. The Ephemerals have to be listening. They have to.\n\n[Choice: Pray to the Ephemerals.",

I close my eyes and try to find the gods in this darkness.\n\n\"Eon, Keeper of Was—\" My voice cracks. This feminine sound coming from my throat. I swallow, the collar cold against my neck, and try again.\n\n\"Eon. You who holds all oaths. Remember that I am Aldric. Remember my mother's grave where I swore to protect the innocent.

My last hope, running down the path into the Everbloom.\n\nSnib scratches his balls through his loincloth, studying me with those yellow eyes. I'm still on my knees in the dirt, tears cutting tracks through dust on this soft face that isn't mine.\n\n\"Well.\" He draws the word out, tasting it. \"That was real stupid, weren't it?\"\n\nHe starts circling me. Slow. Deliberate. Like a wolf that's already eaten and is just deciding what to do with leftovers. Whisperwind drags behind him, tip scarring the earth.\n\n\"Thought they'd save ye?\" He stops directly behind me. I feel his gaze on my ass, on the way the metal strap disappears between cheeks that are too large, too soft. \"Three humans against a big scary goblin horde?\"\n\n\"There IS no horde—\"\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nHis palm connects with my right asscheek hard enough to knock me forward. My hands shoot out to catch myself, and suddenly I'm on all fours. The position—Flux's balls, the POSITION. These udders hang straight down, swaying like overripe fruit. The metal triangles dig deeper, barely containing the flesh that wants to spill free.\n\n\"See, that's the funny part.\" Another spank, lighter, almost thoughtful. \"They think there's dozens of us. Think Aldric the Great got himself killed.\" He laughs, that wet chittering. \"And here ye are, the great hero himself, on hands and knees with yer arse in the air.\"\n\nI try to push up, to stand, but he plants his foot between my shoulder blades. Not hard. Just... present. A reminder.\n\n\"Stay.\"\n\nOne word. Like I'm a dog.\n\n\"I'm not—\"\n\n\"Ye called for help after I told ye not to.\" His foot grinds down slightly, forcing my chest lower. The position makes my ass rise higher, makes these tits hang even more obscenely. \"That's real disobedient, cow-tits. Real ungrateful.\"\n\n\"Ungrateful?! You fucking—\"\n\n\"Could've just killed ye.\" He removes his foot, walks around to face me. Has to crouch to meet my eyes since I'm on all fours. \"Could've bent ye over right there, showed them miners what heroes become. But I didn't. I'm being nice. Slow-like.\"\n\nHis loincloth shifts. The outline is massive. The *tip* of that accursed thing presses against the fabric, leaving a wet spot that grows as I watch. The smell of it makes my nostrils flare.\n\n\"But ye had to go yellin'.\" He stands, scratches his chin like he's thinking deep thoughts. \"Now I gotta teach ye proper. Make sure ye understand the rules.\"\n\n\"Rules?\" I spit the word. \"I don't follow your—\"\n\nHe tugs the leash. Not hard, just a reminder it's there. The collar doesn't tighten, but I feel its weight. Its promise.\n\n\"See, here's what yer gonna do.\" He walks behind me again, and I hear him adjusting himself. The wet sound of his cock sliding against his belly. \"Gonna be me transport now. Me pretty pony.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Ye heard me.\" He's standing directly behind me now. I can feel the heat of him, smell that concentrated reek. \"Heroes used to ride horses, yeah? Well, now yer the horse. Poetic justice, the collar calls it.\"\n\n\"I won't—\"\n\n\"Won't ye?\" His voice drops, becomes almost conversational. \"Ye can say no. Can try to stand up. And I'll just...\" He trails off, but his hand finds my ass again. Not spanking. Just... holding. Possessing. \"Well, I'll make ye do it anyway. Collar'll squeeze that pretty throat. Ye'll pass out. Wake up with me balls on yer face. Or...\"\n\nHis thumb traces the line where the metal thong disappears between my cheeks. The touch is light but devastating. No one should be touching me there. Not there.\n\n\"Or ye can be smart. Crawl nice-like. Play pony for a bit. I bet those boots are hurtin' ya anyway.\"\n\nThe humiliation of it crashes over me in waves. Being given a choice that isn't a choice. Submit willingly or be forced.\n\n\"Tick tock,\" he says cheerfully. \"Sun's gettin' low. Long walk to me hut. Prettier ye'll look crawlin' in the dark, but I'd rather see them tits swing in daylight.\"\n\nI think of Elara. Of what she'd say seeing her husband—her HUSBAND—on all fours with a goblin on my back. The image makes me want to vomit.\n\n\"Please.\" The word escapes before I can stop it. \"Please just walk. I'll follow. I won't run. Just—\"\n\n\"Oh, we're beggin' now?\" He sounds delighted. \"Big strong hero's beggin' not to be a pony?\" He leans down, his breath hot on my ear. \"Tell ye what. Ye ask real nice—real, REAL nice—to be me mount, and I won't make ye trot. Just a walk. Nice and slow.\"\n\n\"I... I can't...\"\n\n\"Sure ye can! Just say...\" He puts on a high, mocking voice. \"'Please, Master Snib, let me be yer pretty pony. I promise to crawl real good with me tits swingin'.'\"\n\nRage fills my skull like smoke in a sealed room. But under it, drowning in it, is something worse.\n\nFear.\n\nBecause I know—I KNOW—he'll make good on his threats. The collar will force me. And it will be worse than if I just...\n\nNo. I'm Aldric the Great. I don't crawl for goblins. I don't become anyone's mount. I'd rather die than—",

But enough surrender that his yellow eyes light up with glee.\n\n\"Smart cow!\" He claps his hands like I've performed a trick. \"See? Already learnin'.\"\n\nHe circles behind me, and I hear him spit in his palms, rubbing them together. Then his fingers sink into my hair—not gentle, not cruel, just *functional*. Like gripping reins.\n\n\"Let's go then. Into the trees. Can't use the main road—yer too pretty now, might cause trouble.\"\n\nHe tugs left, toward the forest line. My palms press into dirt and pine needles as I start to move. The first crawl-step forward and—\n\nThey PULL. Each crawl-step forward launches them into a figure-eight swing — left forward while right swings back, then reversing — and I can't predict which direction they'll drag me next. The metal triangles gave up containing them miles ago; flesh spills around every edge, pink crescents bitten deep. When I lean too far forward my nipples rake through pine needles and I gasp like I've been stabbed.\n\n\"Hehehehe! Look at 'em go!\" Snib bounces on my back, his weight negligible but his presence enormous. \"Like two piglets fighting in a sack!\"\n\nMy hands sink into loam. The forest floor is soft here, centuries of pine needles making a carpet. But crawling—humans aren't meant to crawl like this. My spine wants to arch up but his weight keeps it pressed down. My hips are too wide, making my knees splay outward. And these fucking boots—\n\nWait. They've... changed?\n\nThe metal extends higher now, past my knees, with ridged padding on the caps. Like they're *designed* for crawling. The armor WANTS me to crawl. It's helping me crawl. The realization makes bile rise in my throat.\n\n\"Not the road. Forest path. That way.\" He steers me toward a barely visible track between the pines. Goblin trail. Where his dead kin came from.\n\nI crawl.\n\nPine needles stick to my palms. My tits drag through dirt and dead leaves with each forward motion, collecting forest debris. The weight of them pulls my spine into an arch that makes my ass rise higher, presenting it. Whisperwind drags behind us on its leash from my collar, my legendary blade scraping through mud.\n\n[Image: Whisperwind drags behind us on its leash from my collar, my legendary blade scraping through mud.\n\n\"Ye know what yer new name is?\" Snib asks conversationally, like we're having tea. \"The collar told me. Real pretty name for a pretty thing.\"\n\nI don't answer. Can't. Just focus on moving forward. Right hand. Left knee. Tits swing left. Right knee. Right hand. Tits swing right. The rhythm is hypnotic in its humiliation.\n\n\"Elise.\" He draws it out. \"Eee-leese. El-EESE.\" Each pronunciation more mocking than the last. \"The collar knows all about ye, Elise. Knows ye were Aldric. Knows about yer wife—\"\n\n\"Don't—\"\n\nHe yanks my hair hard enough that my back arches, tits swinging backward to slap against my ribs. \"Knows ye were trying to put a baby in her. Bet she's wondering where her big strong husband went. Aldric's dead. Been dead since the collar clicked.\"\n\nTears blur my vision. I crawl forward, deeper into the Everbloom. The sun is getting low, casting long shadows through the pines. My knees are already raw, even through the weird metal padding. My palms sting. But worse is the weight—always the weight. Every movement sets them swinging, and I can't predict it, can't control it. Sometimes they swing together, sometimes opposite, sometimes one gets caught on something and pulls me sideways.\n\nTwenty minutes. Thirty. My arms shake. Sweat runs down my face, down my back, pooling where Snib sits. The forest is thick here, untraveled. Branches catch my hair. Thorns scrape the exposed sides of my tits. I'm panting like a dog, each breath making them sway more.\n\n\"Getting tired already?\" Snib shifts on my back. \"We got miles to go.\"\n\nThat's when I feel him moving, adjusting. Something drops onto my lower back—fabric. His loincloth. He's...\n\n\"Just airin' out,\" he says cheerfully. \"Gets sweaty under there.\"\n\nThe smell intensifies tenfold—concentrated goblin musk, like rotted cheese mixed with battlefield latrines. But worse is what comes next. I feel him shift, skin against my hair, and then—\n\nWeight. On my skull. Heavy, warm, *alive*.\n\nIt can't be. He didn't. He wouldn't—\n\n\"Ahhhhh.\" He sighs with satisfaction. \"Much better. Nothin' like fresh air on the boys.\"\n\nI feel his weight shift forward. His hands grip my hair tighter, using it for balance. Then something else touches the back of my neck.\n\nWeight. Warm, living weight. Like two overripe plums in a leather sack, pressed against where my neck meets my skull. They're hot, almost fever-hot, and I can feel them... churning? Moving? The skin is wrinkled, rough, dragging against my neck as he adjusts. The smell hits me a second later—concentrated musk, like a stable that's never been mucked out, mixed with something fungal.\n\n[Image: His balls. His fucking balls are resting on my neck.\n\n\"Keep going,\" he says, voice lazy now. \"Long way yet.\"\n\nI sob. But I crawl forward, and that's when I feel something else. A weight on top of my head. Heavy, warm, draped from his groin over my skull like a sleeping snake. It shifts when he moves, sliding against my hair. The weight of it is obscene—how can something attached to a creature so small be so heavy? It pulls at my scalp, making my head tilt forward.\n\n\"Yer hair's real soft,\" he notes, using it to steady himself. \"Good for holdin'.\"\n\nHis cock. That's his cock on my head. That massive, purple thing I glimpsed is just... resting on me. Using me like a shelf.\n\nThe forest path gets rougher. I have to navigate roots, rocks. Each obstacle makes me shift, which makes my tits swing wildly, which makes him bounce, which makes that thing on my head... flex.\n\nJust a small movement. A twitch. But I feel it pulse, feel it grow slightly heavier. Warmer.\n\n\"Ye were so proud,\" he says dreamily. \"Big hero. Dragon slayer. Now look at ye. Crawlin' through dirt with yer udders draggin', gobbococked.\" He made that word up but I understand it perfectly.\n\nAnother flex. Stronger. The weight shifts forward slightly, sliding down toward my forehead. I can feel the shape of it now through my hair—thick as my wrist (my old wrist), with a ridge that catches on my hair as it moves.\n\n\"Elise the Great,\" he giggles. \"Elise the Crawler. Elise the Tit-Wagon.\"\n\nIt's growing. I can feel it extending, getting heavier, sliding further forward. The head of it must be past my hairline now because I feel something wet drip onto my scalp. Just a drop. Warm and thick.\n\n\"Oops,\" Snib says, not sounding sorry at all. \"Gettin' excited. Can't help it with all this bouncin'.\"\n\nAnother drop. This one runs down through my hair, following my part. I want to shake my head, to dislodge him, but the collar is there, always there, promising consequences.\n\nWe crest a small hill and I see it—miles of forest ahead. The Everbloom stretches into the distance, and somewhere beyond that, the desert where he lives. This is impossible. I'll collapse. My arms are already shaking, my knees bleeding through the metal guards.]I plant my palms harder into the dirt, trying to lock my elbows.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe word comes out stronger than I feel. My whole body is shaking—rage, fear, humiliation all mixing into something toxic.\n\n\"I'm not your fucking mount. I'm not your ANYTHING. I'll die before I—\"\n\nThe collar remembers what it is.\n\nIce-cold iron becomes a closing fist. Not gradually—instantly. My hands fly to my throat, abandoning their support. I topple forward and my tits—Flux's balls, the WEIGHT of them—swing down like two overfilled grain sacks dropped from height. They hit the earth with dual thuds that knock the wind from me, compressed between my ribcage and cold dirt, flesh bulging sideways like dough pressed flat.\n\nCan't breathe. Can't even gag. Just silent thrashing as the collar squeezes tighter, tighter—\n\n\"Stubborn cow,\" Snib observes, like commenting on weather.\n\nHis foot connects with my ass—not a kick, just a push. But with no air, no balance, I sprawl forward. My face hits dirt. My ass goes up, the metal thong riding so deep between the cheeks it feels like being split. The position—face down, ass up—would be humiliating if I weren't dying.\n\nBlack flowers bloom across my vision. My mouth opens and closes like a landed fish. The weight on my chest makes it worse—can't expand my lungs even if air could enter.\n\nThen, just as darkness creeps in from the edges, the collar loosens.\n\nA thread of air. Then more. I gasp, cough, retch all at once. Spit and snot string from my face to the ground.\n\n\"See?\" Snib's already climbing onto my back while I'm still choking on air. \"Could've just said yes. I just want a ride.\"\n\nI try to buck him off but my arms are jelly. His legs wrap around my ribs, heels digging into the soft flesh of my sides just below these obscene sacks of meat. His hands find my hair—not grabbing yet, just... gathering it. Like picking up reins.\n\n\"Now then.\" He shifts, getting comfortable. My spine screams from the awkward angle. \"Let's try again. Crawl.\"\n\n\"Get... off...\"\n\nHe yanks my hair. Hard. My head snaps back, neck arching painfully. From this angle I can see the canopy above, the late afternoon sun filtering through pine needles.\n\n\"I said CRAWL.\"\n\nThe collar pulses. A warning.\n\nMy arms shake as I push up. The movement makes everything swing—these massive bags of flesh hanging from my chest have their own momentum, pulling me forward then back as they find their pendulum rhythm. Each motion tugs at muscles that weren't designed for this weight.\n\n\"There we go!\" Snib sounds delighted. \"Now forward. Into the woods.\"\n\nI take one \"step\" forward—hand, then knee. The metal boots scrape and catch on everything. That's when I notice they've... changed. The metal extends higher now, past my knees, articulated to bend the right way. Padded on the inside where my shins press the ground.\n\nThey're made for this. Made for crawling.\n\n\"Good pony!\" He steers me with my hair toward a barely-visible trail between the pines. Goblin tracks—I recognize the gait pattern from years of hunting them. \"Follow me mates' trail. They came through here to get to the mine.\"\n\nEach crawl forward is its own humiliation. The tits don't just hang—they swing in figure-eights, colliding with my arms, the nipples dragging through dirt and pine needles when I lean too low. The metal triangles might as well not exist for all they cover. My ass is so high that the thong has vanished entirely between the cheeks, leaving them completely bare to the cooling air.\n\n\"Ye know what the collar told me?\" Snib chatters as he rides me like I'm a fucking mule. \"Says yer name's not Aldric anymore.\"\n\nMy hands clench in the dirt.\n\n\"Says yer Elise now.\" He tests it out, rolling it around his mouth like wine. \"Eeeee-lise. El-EESE. Elise the pony. Elise the cow. Elise the three-holes.\"\n\nEach variation of my—NOT MY NAME—sends fresh rage through me. But rage is useless when you're on all fours with a goblin's weight on your back.\n\n\"Collar knows everything about ye, El-eese.\" He pronounces it different each time, like he's savoring the destruction of my identity. \"Knows about yer wife. Pretty thing, brown hair? Elara?\"\n\nI stop crawling. My whole body goes rigid. \"It's fucking RED.\"\n\n\"Keep moving.\" Yank on my hair.\n\nMy knees are already raw through the metal padding. Whisperwind drags behind us from a strap on the collar, my legendary blade scarring the earth like a child's toy.\n\n\"Knows how ye were tryin' to make babies with her.\" He's getting excited—I can feel his weight shifting, something hardening against my back through his loincloth. \"Bet she's wondering where her big strong hero went.\"\n\nTears blur my vision. Not from pain—from pure, distilled humiliation. The great Aldric, crawling through the forest with tits swinging like cow udders.\n\nThat's when he shifts again. Reaches back. I hear rustling and then—weight on my ass. He's put something there.\n\n\"Me loincloth,\" he explains. \"Balls need air after all that excitement.\"\n\nI don't understand what he means until—\n\nWeight.\n\nOn top of my head.\n\nHeavy. Warm. Like someone draped a leather-wrapped club across my skull from back to front. It extends from my crown down toward my forehead, thick as my wrist—thicker maybe. The shape of it through my hair...\n\nNo.\n\nHis balls settle against the nape of my neck. I can FEEL them through my hair—heavy as ripe plums, fever-hot, shifting with each breath he takes. The skin textured with coarse hair that scratches. They're... they're massive. How does something his size have...\n\n\"Keep crawling, Elise.\"\n\n[Image: His balls. His fucking balls are resting on my neck.\n\nThe thing on my head shifts. Flexes. Like a snake stirring.\n\n\"Just airin' out,\" he says conversationally. \"Gets sweaty under that loincloth. Yer hair's nice and cool.\"\n\nA sound comes out of me that I've never made in any body. High, broken, wet. It keeps coming.\n\n\"Aww, ye cryin' already? We're just gettin' started!\"\n\nHe yanks my hair to steer me around a fallen log. The motion makes his... equipment... slide forward. The weight redistributes, the tip now hanging over my forehead. I can feel it pulsing with his heartbeat. Each throb makes it twitch against my skull.\n\n\"Ye know what's funny?\" He's getting more excited—the thing on my head is definitely swelling, extending. \"That fancy armor ye got? Made for crawlin'. Boots shaped for it and everything. Like the collar knew ye'd end up on all fours.\"\n\nMy hair frames my face like a funeral shroud. Through the black strands I can see my tits swinging below, hypnotic in their motion. Left-forward-down-back-right. Right-forward-down-back-left. Pine needles stick to the sweaty flesh.\n\n\"Smell that?\" He takes a deep breath. \"That's you. Smell like... like flowers and pussy and somethin' else. Sweet-like.\"\n\nHe leans forward, pressing his chest against my back, and SNIFFS my hair. Long and loud, like sampling wine.\n\n\"Mmmmm. No wonder the collar picked ye. Smell like ye were made for—\"\n\nThe thing on my head throbs. Extends another inch. The tip is past my forehead now, its shadow visible in my peripheral vision.\n\n\"Pretty sunset,\" Snib observes. \"Gonna be dark soon. Hope ye can crawl blind.\"\n\nThat's when I feel it. The first string.\n\nSomething warm and thick touches my forehead. Not a drop—a strand. It dangles from the tip of that monster resting on my head, swaying with each crawl forward. I cross my eyes trying to see it and catch a glimpse—cloudy white, thick as honey, stretching down...down...\n\nIt touches the bridge of my nose.\n\nThe strand swings like a grotesque pendulum between my eyes. Left with each right-hand-forward. Right with each left-knee. The smell of it—concentrated rot mixed with something chemical—makes my nostrils burn. It's so thick it doesn't break, just stretches longer, another inch of vile fluid descending from whatever hellish gland produces this filth.\n\n\"Hehe,\" Snib giggles, feeling his cock twitch again. \"Look at that. Ye got a little decoration.\"\n\n[Choice: Try to shake it off!",

      "text": "The strand swings between my eyes with each crawl forward. Left. Right. Left. The weight of it—how can something so thin have weight? But it does, pulling at the tip of his cock where it rests on my skull like a grotesque crown.\n\nI know about goblin pheromones. Every soldier does. The warnings whispered in barracks about captured women found in warrens, their minds gone, begging for more goblin seed. \"Don't let them get their filth on you,\" the veterans would say. \"Once it's in you, you're done.\"\n\nThis strand—this rope of precum—dangles inches from my mouth.\n\nThe heat of his cock on my head increases. I feel it extending, sliding forward through my hair. The weight shifts from the crown of my skull toward my forehead. Another flex—I feel the veins pulse against my scalp—and the strand gets thicker. No longer thread-thin but rope-thick, cloudy white with yellow streaks.\n\n\"Down the hill now,\" Snib says lazily, steering me with my hair. \"Watch yer footin'.\"\n\nThe slope makes everything worse. My tits don't just hang—they swing forward with gravity, pulling my shoulders down until my neck screams. The weight of them stretches the metal triangles until I hear tiny pings of stressed metal. Snib has to lean back to compensate, which presses his balls harder against my neck. They're so hot they feel like they're burning my skin, and the weight—like two stones in a leather pouch, grinding against my vertebrae.\n\nHis hips start moving. Small circles. Just enjoying the ride.\n\n\"Dame Jiggles,\" he muses. \"Nah. Lady Sway-a-lot. Better.\" Another hip circle. His cock slides further forward. \"Or maybe just Elise the Glazed.\"\n\nI don't understand until another drop falls. This one lands on my forehead, immediately running down toward my nose. It's thick as porridge, warm as fresh milk. The smell—Eon's mercy, the smell. Like cheese left in the sun mixed with something fungal, something wrong.\n\n\"Please—\" The word comes out as a whimper. \"Please stop—\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" He sounds genuinely curious. \"Can't help it if ye make me cock happy. All that crawlin' and swayin'. That's on you.\"\n\nI try to shake my head, to fling the strand away. It stretches but doesn't break, just swings wider, slapping against my cheeks before returning to center. The motion makes his cock flex again—a strong pulse that sends another glob sliding down the strand. It descends slowly, thickening the rope until it's heavy enough that I feel it pulling at my nose.\n\nThe strand finally breaks—not cleanly, but in a stringy mess that drapes across the bridge of my nose. Some lands on my upper lip. The stench is immediate, overwhelming. I stop crawling, reach up to wipe it away—\n\n\"Did I say stop?\" His voice turns sharp. \"Bad pony stops without permission.\"\n\n\"There's—you're LEAKING on me—\"\n\n\"That's yer fault for being so bouncy.\" He laughs, grinding his balls against my neck. \"This is yer medicine for yellin' earlier. Heroes need to learn their place.\"\n\nI try to wipe it with the back of my hand but I'm shaking, exhausted, and I just smear it across my face. Some gets on my fingers. The consistency is vile—sticky and thick, with occasional chunks that might be clotted sperm. The smell coats the inside of my nostrils.\n\n\"Keep goin'. Sun's almost down.\"\n\nI crawl forward. Down the hill, through the thick pine needles. My tits drag through everything—dirt, leaves, thorns. The metal triangles are so stressed they've shifted, and my nipples are exposed, scraping against debris. Every few feet, Snib's cock flexes and more precum drools down. It's getting worse. What started as drops is now a steady leak.\n\n\"Sir Swings-a-lot,\" he giggles, watching my tits. \"Knight of the Sloppy Teats. Champion of Crawlin'.\"\n\nI'm sobbing now as I crawl through the forest with a goblin's cock draped over my head like a hat, his precum running down my face. This morning I was inside my wife. This morning I was Aldric the Great. Now I'm—\n\nThe purple head of his cock slides into my peripheral vision.\n\nIt's grown so much it now extends past my hairline, the swollen head visible above my eyes when I look up. Purple-black like a bruised plum, with the hole at the tip constantly weeping. I watch in horror as it flexes and a thick rope of precum spurts out, arcing down to splatter across my nose and cheek.\n\n\"STOP!\" I shriek, stopping again. \"Please, just—\"\n\nI reach up to wipe it away, desperate to get it off, but my hand is shaking and I'm panting and—\n\nI inhale at the wrong moment.\n\nThe precum goes straight up my nostril. Not a drop—a rope of it, thick and chunky. It BURNS, like inhaling liquid fire. I snort, trying to expel it, but that just pulls it deeper. The burn spreads through my sinuses, behind my eyes, into my brain—\n\nEverything smells like goblin semen now.\n\nThe forest. The dirt. My own sweat. It all reeks of that concentrated musk. My vision shimmers at the edges like heat mirages. I shake my head, trying to clear it, but that just makes his cock bounce and leak more.\n\n\"Hehe, snorted it did ye?\" Snib sounds delighted. \"That'll teach ye.\"\n\n[Image: The Pitchwater River, black with pine tannins.\n\nWe finally reach water—the Pitchwater River, black with pine tannins. I'm beyond exhausted. My arms shake uncontrollably. My knees are bloody even through the padding. My tits are covered in dirt and scratches. Goblin precum is drying on my face in crusty yellowed streaks.\n\n\"Please,\" I gasp. \"Please, I need to rest. Please—\"\n\n\"Yeah, alright. Good spot for the night.\" He stretches on my back, his cock sliding back slightly but still very much present. \"Get us set up then.\"\n\nHe climbs off—finally, FINALLY—and I collapse immediately. My arms give out and I face-plant into the pine needles, ass in the air, too exhausted to care about the position. Everything hurts. Everything stinks of his precum. I can still feel the phantom weight of his balls on my neck.\n\n\"Up up!\" He kicks my ass lightly. \"Horses don't just lay down. Go drink first. Horsey needs water.\"\n\nI try to stand. The boots won't let me. The metal is locked at that extreme angle, forcing me to stay on all fours. He's standing there naked, his massive cock still semi-hard, swinging between his legs as he laughs.\n\n\"Crawl to the water then, Sir Swings-a-lot. Lap it up like the animal ye are.\"\n\nThe humiliation burns but I'm so thirsty. I crawl to the river's edge on trembling limbs, lower my head to the black water. Have to lap at it like a dog, my tits dragging in the mud. The water tastes of pine and earth but it's cold, clean—\n\nI hear splashing. Look up. Snib is standing upstream, maybe twenty feet away.\n\nPissing into the river.\n\nHis stream arcs through the air, thick as my thumb, splashing into the water that's flowing directly toward me. He's grinning, making eye contact as he does it.\n\nI pull back, sputtering, wiping my mouth. He laughs so hard he nearly falls over.\n\n\"Should've seen yer face!\" He shakes the last drops off, his cock bouncing. \"Now. Shelter. Chop chop.\"\n\n\"Let me stand. Please. I need to stand to—\"\n\nHe considers, scratching his balls. \"Yeah, alright. Stand.\"\n\nThe boots unlock with an audible CLICK. I push myself up on shaking legs, having to lean against a tree. Everything spins. The smell of his precum is still coating my sinuses, making me lightheaded. My tits feel like they weigh fifty pounds each, pulling at my shoulders.\n\nHe tosses me Whisperwind. \"Make us something nice. Heroes know how to make camp, yeah?\"\n\nI catch my sword—my sword in his hands all day, defiled—and sob.\n\n[Choice: Go to work.",

      "text": "I cut branches. Lean them against a fallen log. Cover with pine boughs. The kind of shelter I've made a hundred times, but never like this.\n\n[Image: Just the moon through pine branches and the sound of the Pitchwater running black and cold.\n\nThe forest is dark now. Just the moon through pine branches and the sound of the Pitchwater running black and cold. I've built my own small shelter twenty feet from his—as far as the leash allows. Just branches and pine boughs, but it's mine.\n\nSnib is already asleep in his, snoring wetly. Using his own filthy loincloth as a pillow. His cock draped over his thigh like a sleeping snake, still semi-hard, occasionally twitching in his dreams. Completely relaxed. Completely unafraid.\n\nOf me. Of Aldric the Great.\n\nAnd the cruelest cut: he sleeps without guard because I am no longer worth guarding against. If I tried to smother him with pine boughs, the collar would strangle me first. If I tried to run, it would probably just kill me. I'm trapped more thoroughly than any prison cell.\n\nI sob. The sound is high, broken, nothing like my voice should be. These tits heave with each breath, the metal triangles cutting into flesh that's already raw from a day of crawling. My knees are scabbed through the padding. My palms are blistered. My shoulders have carved grooves where the breast-weight hangs from the same two tendons all day — muscles a man's body doesn't even HAVE are screaming in this one.\n\nBut the worst is the smell that won't leave.\n\nIt's coating the inside of my nose like oil. That rope of precum I snorted—it burns still, hours later. The scent is complex in the worst way: rotted fish guts mixed with cheese rind, undercut with something chemical like the tanner's vats, but also something alive, something fertile. It makes my stomach turn but also... also something else. Something I refuse to acknowledge. Every breath I take carries that reek into my lungs, like I'm breathing him, breathing his essence.\n\nAnd under that, almost worse—my own scent.\n\nI smell nothing like Aldric anymore. The river water revealed it when I washed. My sweat smells like honey mixed with flowers I can't name. My hair, even wet, carries lavender and something darker. My skin itself seems to emit this perfume—cloying, feminine, designed to appeal. When the wind shifts, I catch it full force and want to gag.\n\nI kneel by the tallest pine tree hands clasped, and try to pray.\n\n\"Eon, Keeper of What Was,\" my voice cracks — these musical tones, nothing like the gravel I used to pray with — \"remember Aldric. His strength, his sword, his service. The man who saved Eboncrest. The husband who loved Elara with everything he had. You have to remember because this body is making me forget. Keep me in your ledgers. Keep me real. Don't let me dissolve into this.\"\n\nThe wind through pines is my only answer.\n\n\"Flux, Turner of All Things,\" tears stream down this soft face, \"you who dance in change—change me BACK. This isn't transformation, it's desecration. This isn't your dance, it's rape. I'll give anything—my magic, my reputation, years of my life. Just turn the wheel backward. Just this once. I know you flow forward but please, PLEASE, make an exception. Let me hold Elara with my own hands again. Let me stand to piss. Let me exist without these things hanging from my chest. Please.\"\n\nNothing. Just Snib's snoring.\n\n\"Verge, Keeper of the Threshold,\" I'm sobbing harder now, \"I stand at your door. I'm at the precipice of something terrible. Show me through. Show me the path that leads home. Open a door that doesn't lead to degradation. I'm at the edge of becoming something else, something horrible, and I need your guidance. Don't let me cross into what he wants me to be. Keep me on this side of humanity. Please. PLEASE.\"\n\nThe forest swallows my third prayer.\n\n\"Please...\" I whisper to nothing. \"I saved cities. I killed monsters. I was...I was good. Wasn't I good? Why would you let this happen? Why would you make me...\"\n\nMy hands move to these breasts without thinking, holding their weight to relieve my shoulders. The flesh is soft, warm, yielding. Real. Too real. The metal triangles barely cover my nipples, which have hardened in the cold night air into peaks that scrape against the scales with each breath. Everything about this body is hypersensitive, responsive in ways that horrify me.\n\n\"Is this punishment?\" I ask the stars. \"For the goblins I killed? They were monsters! They raid, they rape, they—\"\n\nThe irony chokes me. Here I am, owned by one. Ridden like a horse by one.\nThe gods don't answer. They never do, but tonight their silence feels personal.\n\nElara. Oh, Elara. What did she do today? Did she cook dinner for two, waiting for me? Is she in our bed now, wondering why it's cold? Does she think I'm dead? That might be better—cleaner than the truth. \"Your husband got turned into a goblin's pet with tits like ripe melons\" isn't something she should ever have to hear.\n\nI try to find a position to sleep. Everything hurts. Lying on my back makes the metal triangles dig deeper and these weights pull sideways into my armpits. On my side, the bottom tit goes numb while the top one flops over, the nipple touching the ground through gaps in the pine boughs. On my stomach is impossible—they're too big, pushing me up like I'm lying on grain sacks.\n\nThe metal armor is cutting into me everywhere. The triangles leave red crescents in breast flesh. The thong between my legs has rubbed me raw from all that crawling. The collar is constant cold pressure.\n\nBut taking it off...\n\nCan I even? Will it let me?\n\nI reach for the clasp of the top and find... nothing. No clasp. The metal seems fused. But when I think about removing it—really think—I feel it loosen slightly.\n\nIt wants me to choose. The armor wants me to CHOOSE to be naked.",

Without even the minimal support of those triangles, they hang like overripe melons from my chest, pulling at skin that's never carried such weight. The aureolae are huge—wide as my palm, dusky pink circles that darken toward the centers where my nipples sit like nail-heads. The cold air makes them tighten further, puckering into peaks that ache with sensitivity.\n\n[Image: I look down for the first time. Really look.\nMy hands shake as I reach for the lower clasps. The metal thong peels away from my hips with a wet sound—I've been sweating there too, the metal trap creating its own humid climate. But when I pull it from between my legs...\n\nStrings.\n\nClear, viscous strings stretch from the metal to my—to what's between my legs. They catch moonlight like spider silk, refusing to break, stretching longer until finally snapping back.\n\nI look down for the first time. Really look.\n\nEon's mercy. The lips are plump, swollen-looking even though nothing's touched them. They glisten in the moonlight, coated with moisture that has nothing to do with sweat. The whole area is flushed pink, almost fever-hot, and as I watch—as I fucking WATCH—a bead of clear fluid wells up and drips onto my thigh.\n\nMy pussy. I have a pussy. And it's...\n\nNot just damp. Soaking. The insides of my thighs are glazed with it, making them slip against each other. The scent hits me—salt-sweet ocean tang mixed with something fertile, something female. My body's been producing this all day, this shame-syrup, this traitor's nectar. Getting wet from being spanked, from being ridden, from having goblin cock on my head.\n\n\"No,\" I whisper, but my fingers move without permission, needing to understand this violation. The flesh is soft, yielding, frighteningly sensitive. Just the brush of my fingertip makes something inside clench, a hollow ache I've never felt before. When I pull my finger away, it's coated with clear fluid that strings between my fingers.\n\nI'm aroused. This body is aroused. By HIM.\n\nThe armor lies in the pine needles—black scales gleaming with moisture from my body. My sweat. My... other fluids. It looks almost alive in the moonlight, waiting to crawl back onto me tomorrow.\n\nI curl into the smallest ball I can, but there's no escaping this body. My tits are so large I have to hold them against my chest or they pull painfully to the side. My ass is so plump that lying on my side makes one cheek go numb while the other spreads out behind me. The space between my legs throbs with each heartbeat, empty and aching in a way that makes me want to scream.\n\nEverything smells like sex. My pussy leaking its shame. My sweat carrying that honeyed perfume. Snib's precum still coating my sinuses. I'm drowning in the scent of fucking without having fucked.\n\nSleep is impossible. Every position hurts. Every breath makes my nipples scrape against pine needles. Every shift makes me aware of the wetness between my legs that won't stop, won't dry, just keeps weeping like my body is crying for something I refuse to give it.\n\nElara. I think of Elara and sob, my tears mixing with all the other fluids this body won't stop producing.\n\n[Choice: Tomorrow will be worse.]Taking it off feels like surrender. Like admitting this is my body now, that I need to get *comfortable* in it. The metal might be cutting into me, but at least it's something between my skin and the world. Some pathetic shred of armor that says I'm still a warrior, not just... meat.\n\nI curl on my side in the pine needles. The metal triangle digs deeper into my left breast, the flesh bulging around it. The thong has ridden so far up between my ass cheeks it feels like it's splitting me in half. My pussy—that wet, traitorous thing—pushes against the metal, and I can feel moisture seeping around the edges.\n\nOn my back: the triangles cut into the sides of my breasts while the weight pulls them toward my armpits. The collar digs into my spine. On my stomach: impossible, these things are too large, I'd suffocate. Other side: the bottom breast goes numb immediately while the top one flops over, pulling at my ribs.\n\nI settle for a half-curl, one arm under my head, the other holding these weights against my chest so they don't pull so much. The metal is cold against my skin, warming slowly from my body heat. My own heat. My pussy won't stop leaking around the thong's edges, making sounds when I shift.\n\nAt least he can't see me naked. At least there's that.\n\n[Choice: Your eyes finally close from exhaustion.]",

The fog is thick, salty-sweet, coating my throat with each breath.*\n\n*Behind me, I hear them. Chittering. Millions of tiny voices speaking Goblish in unison. I look back and see them—not goblins but... pieces of goblins. Tadpoles with goblin faces. Sperm with yellow eyes and tiny green arms, swimming through the pink air, their tails whipping frantically as they chase me.*\n\n*\"Gonna get in,\" they chitter in Snib's voice. \"Gonna get deep inside.\"*\n\n*I run but the passage narrows. The pink walls close in, slick with mucus that smells like—like HIS precum. I slip, fall, and they're on me. Tiny hands grabbing my hair, my face. One finds my nostril—the one that snorted his precum—and starts pushing inside.*\n\n*\"This is the way in,\" it squeaks. \"The hero's brain-pussy.\"*\n\n*More follow. They're swimming up my nose, through my sinuses. I feel them behind my eyes, wriggling. The pink cavern isn't a cavern—it's the inside of my own skull. They're inside my brain, swimming through the folds, looking for something.*\n\n*\"Where's the egg?\" they chitter. \"Where's the thought-egg to make babies with?\"*\n\n*I try to scream but my mouth opens and more pour in. Thousands of them, each one a tiny piece of Snib, flooding my brain-womb. They're looking for the part of me that's still Aldric, to fertilize it, to change it.*\n\n*One of them finds something deep in my brain—a glowing memory of Elara. It starts humping it, its tiny green body thrusting. The memory changes, corrupts. Now Elara has yellow eyes. Now she's begging for goblin cock.*\n\n*\"NO!\" I scream, but it comes out as a moan.*\n\n[Image: More memories. They're fucking all my memories.\n*More memories. They're fucking all my memories. My first sword lesson—now I'm learning to suck cock. My wedding night—now Snib is the groom. Each thrust rewrites something, plants something wrong.*\n\n*The chittering gets louder. \"Pregnant! Brain-pregnant! Thought-babies!\"*\n\n*My skull is swelling. I can feel it expanding as they plant their seed in every neuron. My thoughts are getting fat, gravid with wrongness. Something's going to birth from my head, something terrible—*\n\nI wake screaming.\n\nNot a warrior's shout but a woman's shriek that sends night birds scattering. I'm drenched in sweat that reeks of fear and that honeyed perfume. The metal thong is soaked through. My pussy actually *aches* like something was trying to get in.\n\nSnib snores on, undisturbed.\n\nMy head pounds. Behind my eyes where the dream-sperm swam. The smell of his precum is stronger now, like it's seeping deeper into my sinuses, into my brain tissue itself. When I blink, I swear I see pink at the edges of my vision.\n\nJust a dream. Just a dream.\n\nBut my thoughts feel... violated. Like something crawled through them leaving slime trails.\n\nDawn bleeds through the pines like a wound. Real dawn, not dream light. The Pitchwater runs black as ever, its tannin-dark waters catching the first rays. Morning birds call in the Everbloom—thrushes, jays, the distant cry of a wood-hawk. Normal sounds that feel obscene after what my sleeping mind conjured.\n\nSnib stretches outside his shelter, his morning wood pointing at the sky like a purple accusation. He's still naked, balls hanging heavy between his legs.\n\n\"Sleep well, cow-tits?\" He grins, then looks me over. \"Heh. Kept the metal on? Like a turtle scared to leave its shell.\"\n\nThe armor has left its mark. Red crescents where the triangles bit into breast-flesh all night. The thong has carved a valley between my ass cheeks that throbs with each movement. But when I look down, expecting blood, expecting real damage... the marks are already fading. The skin pink but unbroken. Like this body heals faster than it should.\n\n\"Modest little thing now, ain't ye?\" He scratches his balls, the sound wet and specific. \"Big hero sleepin' in her armor like a virgin at market.\"\n\nI try to stand. Everything aches—not the clean ache of training but something deeper. My spine feels compressed from holding those weights all night. The metal boots still force me on my toes, calves cramping immediately.[Choice: Ask to take the boots off.])Elara's on all fours on our marriage bed, auburn hair gripped in a green fist. Her nightgown—the white one with little flowers she wore this morning—is bunched around her waist. That perfect peach ass I spanked hours ago is presented, but not to me.\n\nSnib. Three and a half feet of warty green spite, mounting my wife like she's livestock.\n\n\"Think yer in charge?\" His voice mimics mine from this morning, but wet, chittering. \"Think yer husband's comin' back?\"\n\nI try to move but I'm chained to a post by the collar, forced to watch. Close enough to see everything. The way her flesh jiggles when he spanks her. The way his cock—that purple monster—stretches her pussy lips obscenely wide.\n\n\"Someone's feeling brave this—AHHH!\"\n\n**CRACK.** His palm meets her ass harder than I ever dared.\n\n\"That's 'Master' when I got ye bent over.\" Another spank. Her flesh ripples, turns angry red under green fingers. \"Or would ye prefer the whole street knows what we're doin'?\"\n\n\"They already—oh GODS!\"\n\nHe grabs her hair harder, yanks her head back at an angle that makes her spine arch. His cock—it's TOO BIG, splitting her open, her pussy lips stretched white around the purple shaft as thick as her forearm.\n\nOne thrust and he's buried to the hilt. The wet SQUELCH echoes off our bedroom walls. She SCREAMS—not the playful shriek from this morning but something primal, broken.\n\n\"Aldric! ALDRIC HELP ME!\"\n\nBut I can't move. Can't speak. Just watch.\n\n\"Yer hero's dead,\" Snib grunts, starting to thrust. \"Just me fat gobbo cock now.\"\n\nThe bed frame doesn't just bang—it BREAKS. Wood splinters as he pounds into her with inhuman force. Each thrust drives so deep I can see her belly bulge. **PLAP PLAP PLAP**—but wet, meaty, wrong. His massive balls, hairy and heavy as melons, swing forward to slap against her clit with each stroke.\n\n\"You're going to—*FUCK*—you're DESTROYING me!\"\n\n\"Ye can take it,\" He pulls her hair tighter, forces her back to arch more. The new angle makes her howl. \"Taken worse from gobbo cock before. All human cunts do.\"\n\nShe's trying to crawl away but he's got her pinned, his weight somehow immense despite his size. Her nightgown tears. Her breasts swing free—but they're wrong, they're growing, swelling with each thrust like his cock is inflating them.\n\n\"Please! I'm—I'm cumming! I can't stop CUMMING!\"\n\n\"Already? We just started.\" His finger finds her asshole, pushes in roughly. \"Come on then. Cum on yer Master's cock like a good little broodmare.\"\n\n**SPANK!**\n\n\"I'll—*ah*—I'm sorry Aldric—I can't—it's too BIG!\"\n\n\"If ye can still talk, I ain't doin' me job.\"\n\nShe's cumming. Constantly. A rolling wave of orgasms that makes her whole body convulse. Clear fluid gushes from where they're joined, soaking our marriage bed. The wet sounds get louder, obscene, her pussy churning like butter around his massive shaft.\n\n\"That's seven,\" he growls. \"Want to go for twenty before I breed ye?\"\n\n\"You cocky—oh FUCK! YES! MORE!\"\n\nThe words hit like physical blows. She's... she's starting to push back. Meeting his thrusts.\n\n\"Listen to that,\" Snib grunts, his cock making obscene sucking sounds as her pussy grips it. \"That's the sound of a properly fucked wife. Not like yer husband's little prick.\"\n\n\"Going to—ngh—forget he ever—ever touched me!\"\n\n\"Then ye'll remember this while he rots.\" He leans down, bites her shoulder hard enough to draw blood. \"Remember who owns this cunt now.\"\n\nShe cums again, harder, her tits slapping together as she thrashes. Then again. And again. A rolling wave of orgasms that I could never give her.\n\n\"Please!\" she sobs. \"Please breed me! Give me goblin babies!\"\n\n\"Bout to,\" he grunts, his thrusts getting erratic. His massive balls draw up tight. \"Gonna pump ye so full—\"\n\n\"No,\" I try to scream. \"NO, ELARA, REMEMBER—\"]Our bedroom. Morning light through familiar windows. But everything's wrong.\n\nElara's straddling someone on our marriage bed. She's naked, glowing with sweat, moving with that same steady rhythm she used this morning. But beneath her...\n\nSnib. His massive cock disappearing into her again and again.\n\n\"There's my hero,\" she sighs, running her fingers through his patchy scalp. \"My REAL hero.\"\n\nI'm chained to a post by the collar, forced to watch. Close enough to see the way her pussy lips grip his shaft, how they stretch obscenely around his girth, how wet she is—wetter than she's ever been with me.\n\n\"So perfect,\" Snib murmurs against her collarbone, his warty hands exploring her body with disturbing tenderness. \"Every freckle. Every curve. Made for gobbo cock.\"\n\nMorning light paints their joined bodies gold and green. He runs his clawed fingers up her thighs with reverence, like she's something holy he's defiling.\n\n\"You're finally the right size,\" she breathes, rocking against him. \"Not like my husband's little—mmmmm—\"\n\n\"His IS in the way now,\" Snib agrees, then sits up, bringing her with him so she's fully impaled. \"Dead heroes can't touch ye anymore.\"\n\nShe laughs—that bright sound I love—while grinding on monster cock. \"Was just thinking of you. Even when he was inside me this morning.\"\n\n\"What?\" The word tears from my throat but they don't hear.\n\nShe rises up slowly, so slowly, his purple shaft glistening with her arousal. The veins on it pulse visibly, each ridge catching on her pussy lips as she moves.\n\n\"Just remembering why I chose you,\" she tells him, looking into yellow eyes with adoration.\n\n\"My sparklin' personality?\"\n\n\"Your perfect cock.\"\n\nShe sinks down in one smooth motion, taking all twelve inches. They both groan—her with satisfaction, him with possession. She starts to ride him with that same devastating rhythm, but now her face shows true pleasure, not the performance she gave me.\n\n\"Every morning,\" she breathes. \"Every morning I'll wake up to this instead of his fumbling.\"\n\n\"Every morning IS a gift with ye,\" he replies, watching her breasts bounce.\n\nShe's so WET. I can hear it—the obscene squelching as she rides him, the splash of fluids. Her pussy is creaming around his cock, white foam building where they join. His massive balls, heavy and hairy, rest on our marriage bed like overripe fruit.\n\n\"Touch me,\" she whispers to him.\n\nHis thumb finds her clit with surprising gentleness. His other hand cups her breast, rolls the nipple just how she likes. She gasps with genuine pleasure, not the sounds she made for me.\n\n\"That's it, love. Let go for yer true mate.\"\n\n\"Not yet—want to—oh gods—want to feel you claim me properly—\"\n\n\"We got forever now.\" He sits up straighter, changing the angle. Now they're kissing—deep, passionate, her tongue exploring his diseased mouth eagerly. She moans into the kiss as he swallows her pleasure.\n\nShe cums—not the controlled shudder from this morning but something wild, primal. Her whole body convulses around him, pussy clenching visibly around his shaft. He holds her through it, kisses her temple with mock tenderness.\n\n\"Well done, me perfect girl.\"\n\nShe's still shaking when she starts moving again, oversensitive but desperate. \"Your turn. Want to feel it. Want your seed instead of his weak dribbles.\"\n\n\"Elara, you loved me—\" I sob, but I'm invisible.\n\n\"Shh.\" She pushes him back down, pins his shoulders. \"My REAL hero needs his reward.\"\n\nShe leans down, changes the angle. Now her breasts press against his warty chest, her lips against his pointed ear.\n\n\"I want you to cum inside me, Master. Want to feel goblin seed replace his. Want to carry your babies, only yours, forever.\"\n\n\"Elara—\"\n\n\"Maybe this time,\" she whispers to him lovingly. \"Maybe this time I'll give you triplets.\"\n\nThe tenderness in her voice—the same tone she used with me—breaks something inside me. Snib rolls them over, needs to be deeper. She wraps her legs around his small body, pulls him close, and they move together like they've been lovers for years.\n\nHis thrusts are slow but impossibly deep. Each one makes her whole body shudder. She's cumming again—or still—a constant rolling orgasm that has her speaking in tongues.\n\n\"Yes,\" she breathes. \"Ephemerals, you fill me so much better than—than—who was I married to?\"\n\nHer nails rake down his back with genuine passion. Sweat makes their bodies slide together. The wet music of their joining fills our bedroom—the place where we made love this morning now defiled forever.\n\n\"Close,\" he warns.\n\n\"Me too! Again! How do you always—oh!\"\n\nShe arches above him, a perfect bow of pleasure, and I can see his massive balls drawing up tight—\n\nI wake screaming.\n\nActually screaming, high and feminine, my throat raw. I'm covered in cold sweat that makes these tits slide against each other. My pussy—\n\nNo. NO.\n\nIt's soaking. Drenched. I can feel it pulsing, clenching around nothing, exactly like... like Elara did in the dream when she...\n\nThe shame crashes over me so hard I vomit. Just bile and spit, but I retch into the pine needles while my cunt drools onto my thighs.\n\nDawn is breaking through the trees. Real dawn, not dream light. Snib is stretching outside his shelter, his morning wood tenting upward, casual as anything.\n\n\"Sleep well, cow-tits?\" He grins, scratching his balls.\n\n[Choice: You're naked!]",

      "text": "The realization hits like ice water as his yellow eyes travel down my body with the slow appreciation of a merchant evaluating goods. From my sweat-damp hair to my bare feet, taking special time at the places that matter—the heavy swing of exposed breasts, the wet gleam between my thighs.\n\nOne arm crosses over my chest, trying to contain tits that overflow around it. The other hand drops to cover my pussy, fingers immediately becoming slick with the moisture there. The position just makes everything worse—pushing my breasts up and together, making me hunch forward in a way that presents my ass.\n\n\"Hehe. Shy now?\" Snib scratches his morning wood through his loincloth, the motion making it bounce. \"Bit late for modesty.\"\n\nThe armor. Where did I—there, in the pine needles, black scales gleaming with dew. I scramble for it on hands and knees, giving him a full view of everything swinging and jiggling. My fingers shake as I grab the metal triangles.\n\nPutting it on is worse than taking it off. The clasps hide beneath breast-flesh, requiring me to lift each tit and fumble blind while Snib provides commentary.\n\n\"Left one's bigger,\" he observes. \"Didja know that? Left tit's got more heft.\"\n\nThe metal is cold and wet with morning dew. When I finally manage to connect the chains behind my back, the triangles immediately dig into tender flesh, barely containing anything. My nipples are still hard from cold and... and whatever else... pressing visibly through the scales.\n\nThe bottom piece is worse. I have to step into it, pull it up my thighs that are still slick with shame. The metal thong immediately disappears between my ass cheeks with a wet *squelch*. When I adjust the front triangle over my mound, strings of moisture connect metal to flesh before breaking.\n\n\"Missed a spot,\" Snib notes, pointing.\n\nA strand of my own wetness hangs from the edge of the metal, catching morning light like spider silk. I wipe it with shaking fingers but that just spreads the moisture.\n\nThe boots. Flux's balls, the boots.\n\nThey've definitely changed overnight—now rising to mid-thigh with dozens of buckles and laces. I sit on a log to pull them on, having to point my toes like some Thuulk silkhouse whore to get my feet into the extreme arch. The metal is articulated, form-fitting, molding to my calves as I begin the endless process of lacing.\n\nWhy didn't I need to do this when I took them off?\n\nFirst the ankle buckles—three of them, each requiring me to lean forward, making my tits pool in my lap. Then the shin laces, crisscrossing up my legs in a pattern that takes forever to figure out. My fingers feel strange, clumsy but also... patient? Like I have all the time in the world to dress myself pretty.\n\n\"Twenty-seven on each boot,\" Snib counts helpfully.\n\nBy the time I reach my thighs, I'm panting. Not from exertion but from the process itself—the ritual of it, the way each lace pulled tight makes the metal grip my legs like hands. The final buckles at the top squeeze my thighs, making the flesh bulge slightly over the edges.\n\nWhen I finally stand, the spike heels forcing me into that humiliating posture, Snib nods approval.\n\n\"Better. Can see everythin' but also nothin'. That's the point of armor like that.\"\n\n\"It's not armor,\" I mutter, but the words come out without heat.\n\n\"Feelin' generous today,\" he announces, adjusting his morning wood again. \"No crawlin'. We walk like people. Well, I walk. You...\" He gestures at my forced mince. \"You do whatever that is.\"\n\nRelief floods through me so powerfully I almost say thank you. Almost. I catch myself, but the fact that the words nearly escaped...\n\n\"Just gotta make it to me hut by dark. Stay off the road, follow the river.\" He stretches, his cock bouncing obscenely in his loincloth. \"Oh, and I'm hungry. You're catchin' breakfast.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to fish without—\"\n\n\"Sure ye do. Big hero like you?\" He grins. \"River's right there. Fish in it. Easy.\"\n\n\"Let me use magic. I could freeze them, make it quick—\"\n\nFor a moment his eyes narrow, calculating. I see him consider it, weigh the options. Then he shakes his head.\n\n\"Nah. Magic's for special occasions. Use a stick or somethin'. Make a spear.\"\n\n\"Please.\" The word slips out easier today. \"It would be faster. More efficient. I promise I'll only—\"\n\n\"Said no.\" But he's still thinking, I can see it. Like he's measuring something about me, testing. \"Maybe later. When ye've been good longer.\"\n\nGood. Like I'm a dog learning tricks.\n\n\"There's some good spots upstream,\" he continues. \"Past where I pissed last night. Should be bitin' this early.\"\n\nI want to argue. Want to refuse. But my stomach growls and there's this strange fog in my head, like thoughts are taking longer to form. The anger is still there but muffled, wrapped in cotton. Must be exhaustion. Must be hunger.\n\n\"Fine,\" I hear myself say. \"Fish.\"\n\n\"Please.\" The word comes out before I mean it to. Softer than yesterday. \"Can I... the boots. Can I take them off? Just for—\"\n\n\"Nah.\" He pisses against a tree, the stream thick and yellow. \"But I'm feelin' nice today. No more crawlin'. We walk upright like people. Well, I walk. You mince.\"\n\nThe relief that floods through me is... too much. Too grateful. Some part of my mind notes this, flags it as wrong, but the thought slips away like oil on water. Everything feels slightly... sideways. Like the world tilted three degrees while I slept.\n\n\"Long way to me hut still,\" he says, shaking the last drops off. They splatter on pine needles. \"Through the Bleakwood, past the Bonebridges. Need strength for walkin'.\"\n\n\"Everbloom.\"\n\n\"Nah, it's the Bleakwood.\"\n\nHe looks at the river, then at me.\n\n\"Hungry. Want fish.\"\n\n\"I don't—\"\n\n\"River's full of 'em. Shadowtrout, the black ones. Sweet meat.\" He plops down on a rock, cock swaying. \"You catch.\"\n\n\"With what?\" My voice has lost some of its edge.\n\n\"Find a stick. Sharpen it. Heroes know woodcraft, yeah?\"\n\nThe casual assumption that I'll obey. That I'll just... fish for him. Like a servant. Like a wife. The rage should be volcanic but it comes out tired, worn smooth like river stones.\n\nI find myself looking for a suitable branch before I've decided to comply. I'm hungry as well, and that's overriding everything.\n\nMy hands—these small, soft hands—still remember some things. I find a straight piece of ash, use a river rock to sharpen one end to a point. The work is harder with these weak arms. My breasts keep getting in the way when I lean forward. Sweat runs between them, carrying that honeyed scent that isn't mine.\n\n\"Wait.\" The idea surfaces through the fog. \"I could... Glacieshold. I could freeze a section of river. The fish would be stunned, easy to—\"\n\n\"No magic.\" He says it quick. Sharp.\n\n\"But it would be faster—\"\n\n\"Said no.\" Something flickers in his yellow eyes. Calculation? Fear? \"Not yet. Maybe later. When ye've been good longer.\"\n\n*When I've been good.* The phrase should enrage me. Instead, I just feel... disappointed? Like a child denied a treat. What's wrong with my thoughts? They keep sliding sideways, finding the path of least resistance.\n\n[Choice: Go spear-fishing.",

My spike-heels catch on every root, every stone, forcing this obscene hip-sway that makes my ass clap softly with each step. *Click-clop-click-clop* against ancient stones. Snib leads me at his leisure, occasionally correcting my path with a tug on the leash.\n\n\"So,\" he says after an hour of silence, \"ye know we got our own language, right?\"\n\nI don't respond. Just focus on not falling.\n\n\"Bet ye think we just grunt and point.\" Another tug, steering me around a fallen oak. \"But we got words for everything. Specially fuckin'.\"\n\nThe casual vulgarity makes my face burn. This morning it would have been rage. Now my hips shift on their own and the metal thong grinds against swollen flesh I'm trying to pretend isn't there.\n\n\"Forty-three words just for cummin',\" he continues, pride creeping into his voice. \"Humans got what, two? Three? We got *splurtik* for weak dribbles—insultin', that one. *Grok-splash* for proper breeding shots. *Thrack-gush* for when ye empty everything at once.\"\n\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" The question escapes before I can stop it.\n\n\"Ye're gonna need to know 'em soon enough.\" He laughs, that wet chittering. \"When yer beggin' in Goblish.\"\n\nWe cross a shallow ford. The cold water makes my nipples harden instantly, visible through the metal triangles. Snib watches them bounce with each step, then continues his lecture.\n\n\"*Thrack* is basic fuckin'. Everyone knows that one. Even humans say it now.\" He sounds genuinely pleased by this linguistic contamination. \"But we got specifics. *Skull-thrack* for mouth. *Womb-thrack* for deep breeding. *Rut-thrack* when it's violent.\"\n\nThe path narrows. I have to duck under low branches, making my tits swing and collide. Snib finds this hilarious.\n\n\"See, that's *swing-udder* in Goblish. The way they move. We notice everything about tits. Got twelve words just for different bounces.\"\n\nHours pass like this. Him talking, me walking, trying not to listen. But the words seep in anyway. *Breeding-hole. Cum-tank. Face-cunt.* Each one makes my pussy clench involuntarily, that horrible empty ache getting worse.\n\n\"Know what's funny?\" We're climbing now, the Pitchwater falls growing louder. \"Humans think we're stupid 'cause our language got simple. But it got simple 'cause we only talk about what matters. Fuckin' and fightin'. What else is there?\"\n\n\"Love,\" I say without thinking. \"Art. Honor—\"\n\n\"HAH!\" He actually falls over laughing, has to use Whisperwind to stand back up. \"Honor! From the woman with her tits out! Walkin' on a leash!\"\n\nThe shame burns but there's truth in it. What honor do I have left? Walking through the forest in this obscene armor, my pussy leaving a snail-trail of moisture down my thighs.\n\nBy afternoon we break from the treeline. The Shifting Sands stretch before us—endless dunes under a brass sky.\n\n\"Home sweet home,\" he says, pointing to a structure that barely deserves the name.\n\nThe hut leans against a dead tree like a drunk against a wall. Patches of hide and salvaged wood make walls that don't quite meet. The roof is partially collapsed. Through gaps I can see piles of bones, rags, things I don't want to identify.\n\n\"Built it meself,\" he says proudly. \"After me tribe kicked me out.\"\n\nPast a cluster of worn stone—an ancient well with a pump half-buried in sand, probably K'Tarran. A goblin could never build anything like that.\n\n\"'Course, who's laughin' now? Got me own human cow.\"\n\nWe stop outside the entrance—just a hide flap that reeks of piss and rot. Snib turns to face me, has to crane his neck to meet my eyes. His expression shifts to something calculating.\n\n\"Listen good, cow-tits. Here's the thing.\" He scratches his balls through his loincloth, thinking. \"Could just mount ye right now. Collar says ye're mine to use however. Could spend all night pumpin' goblin babies into that wet cunt.\"\n\nMy whole body goes rigid. The terror must show on my face because he laughs.\n\n\"But that's borin'. Too fast. Heroes need to marinate, ye know? Let all them proud thoughts dissolve slow-like.\"\n\nHe walks around me, appraising. I feel his gaze on my ass, my tits, the wet spot on the metal triangle between my legs.\n\n\"So here's me generous offer.\" He stops in front of me again. \"Ye do chores—cleanin', cookin', whatever. And ye drain me balls each mornin'. Just with yer mouth.\"\n\n\"Just suckin',\" he continues, seeing my horror. \"Five minutes. Maybe ten if I'm really backed up. Ye can spit it all out after if ye want. Don't have to swallow a drop.\"\n\n\"Never.\" The word comes out as a whisper.\n\n\"Never?\" He tilts his head. \"Think about it. Seven days of cock-polishin', then ye're free. I'll remove the collar, ye go home to that pretty wife. Tell her ye were captured but escaped. Hero returns!\"\n\nHe's lying. Has to be lying. But...\n\n\"Why?\" My voice cracks. \"Why would you—\"\n\n\"'Cause it's funnier this way.\" He grins wider. \"Watchin' ye choose it. Watchin' ye tell yerself it's just seven days, just suckin', not real whoring. The slow breakdown's always better than the quick break.\"\n\n\"The collar—\"\n\n\"Collar won't come off unless I want it to. But I give me word—seven days, ye drain me balls each mornin' like a good cow, then ye're free. If ye want to be.\"\n\n*If I want to be.* The addition makes my skin crawl.\n\n\"Me balls get full. Painful full. Need drainin' every morning or I get... aggressive.\" He grins. \"So ye drain 'em. Just with yer mouth. Five minutes, maybe ten. Every morning for seven days.\"\n\n\"You're insane if you think—\"\n\n\"Let me finish.\" He holds up a warty finger. \"Seven days of morning service. Ye can spit it all out after—don't got to swallow a drop. Just milk me cock with that pretty throat, let me pump out the night's buildup. Do that without missin' a day, and on the eighth morning...\"\n\nHe pauses for effect.\n\n\"I take off the collar. Let ye go. Free.\"\n\nThe words hang in the stinking air. Freedom. In just a week. It's too good to be true. It has to be.\n\n\"You're lying.\"\n\n\"Collar won't let me lie to ye direct.\" He taps his temple. \"It tells me when I'm being too sneaky. This is straight truth. Seven days of cock-sucking, then freedom.\"\n\n\"Why?\" My voice is smaller than it should be. \"Why would you—\"\n\n\"Because watchin' Aldric the Great *choose* to suck me cock every morning? That's worth more than gold. And maybe...\" He grins wider. \"Maybe ye won't make it seven days. Maybe ye'll decide ye like it. Maybe ye'll beg to stay.\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Then ye got nothing to lose.\" He spreads his legs wider. His cock is fully hard now, twelve inches of purple horror. \"Starting tonight, then six more mornings. Dawn service, like prayers. Then whatever chores need doing—cleaning, cooking, normal woman stuff. End of seven days, ye walk away.\"\n\nMy mind races through possibilities. His precum—I know it's dangerous. But just in my mouth? I can spit it out. Rinse with water. Not let it get inside me properly. Seven days of humiliation versus a lifetime of slavery.\n\n\"If ye say no,\" he adds casually, \"then we do this the hard way. I mount ye tonight. Tomorrow. Every day until yer belly swells with gobbo spawn. Yer choice.\"",

Though...\" He pretends to think. \"Ye gotta do it proper. No half-assed licks. Real throat-work. The kind that makes me balls empty proper. And ye gotta thank me after.\"\n\n\"Thank you?!\"\n\n\"For the opportunity. For not mounting ye like I could.\" He's fully erect now, the head purple-dark and already leaking. \"So what's it gonna be, cow-tits? Seven days of morning worship, or a lifetime of gobbo babies?\"\n\nHis cock drools precum onto the dirt floor. The stench fills the hut and my thoughts go honey-slow, like trying to read underwater.\n\n\"Ye're strong, yeah? Big hero like you can handle some cock-snot. Spit it out.\"\n\n*Cock-snot.* The vulgarity makes me gag but also... also my pussy clenches. Why does my pussy clench?\n\n\"Tonight after dinner,\" I hear myself say. \"Then mornings. Seven days. Then I'm free.\"\n\n\"If ye want to be,\" he adds again, that knowing grin spreading. \"Shake on it?\"\n\nI look at his extended hand. Warty. Dirty. Probably covered in cock-sweat from all that scratching.\n\nI take it.\n\nHis grip is firm, warm. \"Welcome home, Elise. Let's get ye settled in yer new life.\"\n\nThe hide flap of his hut beckons like a mouth. Beyond it, shadows and stench and seven days of degradation I'm choosing. CHOOSING.\n\nBut what choice do I really have?\n\n\"Oh,\" he adds casually, \"first suck is after dinner. Give ye time to prepare yerself mentally. Maybe practice openin' yer throat.\"\n\n[Choice: That evening...]\n\nSeven days. Seven mornings of putting that purple-headed monster in my mouth. My gorge rises just from the arithmetic.\n\n\"I need to...\" My voice sounds strange, distant. \"I need to think about—\"\n\n\"Think?\" Snib scratches his balls through his loincloth, the wet sound filling the silence. \"What's to think? Either ye want freedom or ye want gobbo babies. Simple math, even for a woman-brain like yers.\"\n\n*Woman-brain.* The insult should ignite rage but it just... slides off. Like water on oiled leather. Everything feels slippery in my thoughts, hard to grip. Must be exhaustion. Must be hunger. Must be anything except—\n\nThat smell. His cock-stench is everywhere in this hut, concentrated from months of him sleeping here, rutting here, spurting his seed on these very furs. It coats the inside of my nostrils like lamp oil, seeping deeper with each breath. Making my thoughts move through honey.\n\n\"Seven days,\" I hear myself whisper. Testing the words. They taste like copper and surrender. \"Just mornings. Just... sucking.\"\n\n\"That's right, cow-tits.\" He's fully hard now, his cock pushing his loincloth out like a tent pole. A wet spot spreads where the tip presses against the fabric. \"Just drainin' these heavy balls so they don't ache. That's practically a kindness yer doing.\"\n\nI watch a bead of precum soak through his loincloth. Watch it grow from coin-sized to palm-sized. The rational part of me—Aldric's part—screams warnings about pheromones, about corruption, about what happens to women exposed to goblin seed. But that voice sounds so far away now. Like someone shouting from another room while I'm underwater.\n\n\"I won't...\" The words are thick, slow. \"I'm not going to...\"\n\nBut even as I speak, my knees are bending. Just slightly. My body tilting forward like a flower toward sick sunlight. The metal boots scrape against his floor—dirt and old bones and things I don't want to identify—as I take a tiny step closer.\n\n\"See?\" His grin widens. \"Yer body knows what's best. Smart body on a silly hero.\"\n\n[Minigame]]",

      "text": "\"Seven days,\" I hear myself say. The words come out breathy, defeated. \"Then I'm free.\"\n\nThe words taste like ash and surrender. My voice—this musical, feminine voice—cracks on 'free.' Because some part of me already knows it's a lie. But the alternative... mounting me like livestock, pumping me full of his spawn...\n\n\"Smart cow.\" He extends his warty hand. \"Shake on it?\"\n\nI stare at his palm. Green skin mottled with warts, dirt under his nails, probably sticky with cock-sweat from all that scratching. This is what I've become—making deals with something I used to exterminate for sport.\n\nOur palms meet. His grip is firm, too warm, slightly damp. The contact makes my skin crawl but also... also something else. A flutter in my belly that might be revulsion or might be my womb recognizing its new master's touch.\n\n\"If ye want to be,\" he adds with that knowing grin, pumping my hand up and down. \"Free, that is.\"\n\nThe handshake goes on too long. His thumb strokes the inside of my wrist, finding my pulse. Feeling how fast my heart is racing. When he finally lets go, my palm is slick with his sweat. I resist the urge to wipe it on my thighs.\n\n\"Welcome home, Elise.\" He gestures to his squalid hut. \"Let's get ye settled in yer new life.\"\n\n*New life.* The words echo in my skull. This morning I was Aldric, trying to put a baby in my wife. Now I'm negotiating blowjob schedules with a creature that barely comes up to my tits.\n\n\"Oh,\" he adds casually, already turning away, \"first suck is after dinner. Give ye time to prepare yerself mentally. Maybe practice openin' yer throat. Wouldn't want ye to choke on the first night.\"\n\nThe casualness of it—like we're discussing laundry—makes my pussy clench. That empty ache between my legs that's been building all day suddenly intensifies. My thighs are so wet they slip against each other when I walk.\n\n\"I'll... I'll cook the fish,\" I whisper, needing to focus on something, anything else.\n\n\"Good girl. Already learnin' yer place.\"\n\nThe praise—PRAISE from this thing—shouldn't make warmth bloom in my chest. But it does. Flux help me, it does.\n\n[Choice: That evening...]\n\n\"NO!\"\n\nThe word tears from my throat with more force than I knew I had left. It echoes off the crude walls, seems to push back the fog that's been creeping through my thoughts like morning mist.\n\n\"No. I won't—I'm not going to suck your disgusting cock. Not tonight. Not for seven mornings. Not EVER.\"\n\nThe silence stretches between us like a held breath. Snib's yellow eyes narrow to slits, his head tilting like a confused dog hearing a new sound.\n\n\"No?\" He tests the word, rolling it around his mouth like spoiled wine. \"Did the great hero just say... no?\"\n\n\"You heard me.\" My whole body trembles—rage or fear, I can't tell anymore. \"I'm Aldric the Great. I've killed hundreds of your kind. I don't negotiate with vermin. I don't make deals with parasites. And I certainly don't put goblin cock in my—\"\n\nHis laughter cuts me off. Not angry—delighted. Like a child discovering his birthday came early.\n\n\"Oh, this is BETTER!\" He claps his warty hands, actually bounces on his toes. \"The hero's still got fight! Thought that pretty head was already mush, but look at ye! Standin' there with them udders heavin', tellin' me no!\"\n\n\"Find another toy.\" The spit flies from my lips. \"Kill me if you want. I'd rather die than—\"\n\n\"Than suck cock, yeah yeah.\" He waves dismissively, already moving. \"But would ye rather be mounted?\"\n\nThe word 'mounted' sends ice through my veins. Like I'm livestock. Like I'm a—\n\nHe's circling now, that roach-quick scuttle that makes my skin crawl. His loincloth tents obscenely, the fabric dark with moisture where the tip presses.\n\n\"See, I wanted to go slow.\" His voice drops, becomes conversational. \"Let ye marinate in yer own shame. But if ye're gonna be difficult...\"\n\nHe stops behind me. I try to turn but the collar pulls taut—when did the leash appear in his hand?\n\n\"Then we do this the old way. The goblin way.\"\n\n*YANK.*\n\nThe leash jerks me forward so hard I stumble. My tits swing like temple bells, nearly escaping the metal triangles. My hands shoot out to catch myself and I end up bent at the waist, ass presented—\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nHis palm connects with my right cheek hard enough to make the flesh ripple in waves. The sound echoes off the hut's walls like thunder.\n\n\"THAT'S for sayin' no.\" *CRACK!* Left cheek. \"That's for thinkin' ye got choices.\" *CRACK!* \"And that's just 'cause I like watchin' it jiggle.\"\n\nMy knees buckle. The metal boots scrape against packed dirt as I try to stay upright, but he yanks the leash DOWN, hard, and suddenly I'm on all fours. The position—Flux's balls, the POSITION. These obscene sacks of flesh hang straight down, dragging in the dirt, nipples scraping earth through the gaps in the scales.\n\n\"There we go.\" He sounds pleased. \"Proper position for a hero.\"\n\nHis feet shift on my ass, toes digging into the soft meat for purchase. I feel him pull back, dragging that massive green shaft through my crack—the bulbous purple head catches on my asshole for one terrifying heartbeat before sliding past. The weight of it drops down, hanging like a warm club between my spread thighs.\n\n\"Please—\" The word tears out before I can stop it. \"Please, I'll do the deal, I'll suck—\"\n\n\"Nah.\" He bounces slightly, making my ass jiggle under his weight. \"Changed me mind. Gonna plant me flag in hero-cunt instead.\"\n\nHis cock swings forward, the fat mushroom head kissing my pussy lips with a wet *smooch* sound. Not pushing. Just... resting there. I feel my lips part slightly around the tip, like they're trying to give it a kiss back. The heat of him burns against my entrance. A rope of his precum drools down, mixing with the shameful wetness already glazing my thighs.\n\n\"Feel that?\" He grinds the head in small circles, spreading his slime around my entrance. \"Me cock knockin' on yer door.\"\n\nI try to crawl forward but the boots have locked my shins to the dirt. Metal fused to earth like I'm in breeding stocks. My tits drag through pine needles as I struggle, the metal triangles catching and pulling.\n\n\"No no NO—\"\n\nHe grabs my hair with both hands, yanking my head back so hard my spine curves. The angle forces my ass even higher, pussy tilted up like an offering plate. I feel him notch himself properly now—the head nestled between my lips, spreading them obscenely wide just from the girth. My entrance stretches around just the tip and already it feels impossible.\n\n\"Fer Grotch.\" He pushes forward an inch. My pussy lips stretch white around purple-green meat. \"Fer Scab.\" Another inch. The flared ridge of his cockhead pops past my entrance with a wet *SCHLORP*. \"And this—\"\n\nHe SLAMS home.\n\n[Image: My pussy splits open around him like a sword through a peach.\n\nThe entire length spears into me in one brutal thrust. Every ridge, every wart, every throbbing vein carves through my walls as he hilts himself balls-deep. His hairy sack SMACKS against something between my legs that sends lightning through my spine—some button of flesh where my own cock used to be. The impact makes a wet *SPLAT* as his balls stick to my soaked lips before dropping away.\n\n\"FUUUUCK YEAH!\" He howls, grinding his hips in circles. \"TIGHT AS A VIRGIN! GRIPPIN' ME LIKE A FIST!\"",

My whole chest vibrates with it, this feminine keen that I've never made, never COULD make before. It's surrender translated to sound. It's my body singing its violation. The noise fills the hut, high and breaking, nothing like Aldric's battle roars.\n\n\"THERE it is!\" Snib crows, grinding deeper. \"There's the bitch-noise! Knew ye had it in ye!\"\n\nThe moan keeps coming. I try to stop it but my throat has mutinied. Each tiny movement of his cock inside me pulls another whimper out. Little \"nnh, nnh, nnh\" sounds with each pulse of his shaft. My voice has become an instrument he's playing with his cock.\n\nHe pulls back slowly, dragging every inch through my clutching walls. I feel myself trying to hold him, muscles I never had before squeezing around his retreat. The wet *SCHLOOOOORP* sound as he withdraws makes my face burn. When just his head remains inside, stretching my entrance, he pauses.\n\n\"Listen to that hungry cunt.\" He flexes, making his cock jump inside me. \"Suckin' at me like a toothless granny on candy.\"\n\nThen he RAMS forward again.\n\n*PLAP!*\n\nHis balls swing forward like wrecking balls, slapping my clit with a meaty crack. The impact sends something electric through my entire body—not pain but something worse. Something that makes my pussy clench around him, milking his shaft.\n\n\"HAH! Pussy's beggin' for it already!\" He starts fucking in earnest now, short brutal thrusts that make my whole body jolt. \"One thrust and the hero's moanin'! Two thrusts and she's milkin' me cock!\"\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\nEach impact of his hips against my ass makes the meat ripple outward in waves. My cheeks clap around his skinny hips, the sound obscene in the small hut. His balls maintain their own rhythm—swinging forward to spank my clit a half-second after each thrust. The dual percussion makes me sound like a drum being beaten.\n\nMy tits have their own physics. Each thrust sends them swinging forward, heavy and inevitable as millstones. They collide under me with meaty THWAPs before swinging back, nipples dragging through dirt. The metal triangles have shifted completely, doing nothing but cutting into the sides while my nipples scrape earth.\n\n\"Look at them udders swing!\" He leans forward, his pot belly pressing against my lower back. \"Gonna milk ye from both ends! Breed ye while ye feed me babies!\"\n\nHis weight forces me lower. My face presses into the dirt while my ass stays high, speared on his cock. He's so small he can barely reach my shoulders, but somehow he's completely in control. His clawed feet grip my ass cheeks, using them like handholds as he hammers into me.\n\n*SQUELCH-PLAP-SQUELCH-PLAP*\n\nThe sounds get wetter. My pussy is GUSHING around him, each thrust pushing out clear fluid that runs down my thighs. I've never been this wet in my life—as a man OR this violation of a body. It's like my insides are melting, turning to slick heat that eases his passage.\n\n\"Wet as a marsh!\" He spits—I feel the glob land between my shoulder blades and slide down my spine. \"Soakin' me balls! This is what hero-cunts are for!\"\n\nHis cock feels like it's reshaping me from the inside. Each thrust carves deeper, the bulbous head punching into something at my deepest point that makes stars explode behind my eyes. It's like being hollowed out and filled simultaneously. My pussy has become a sheath and his cock is the only sword that fits.\n\n\"*Grulkaz-thrack! Womb-thrack! Breed-pound!*\" He starts chanting in Goblish, each word timed to a thrust. \"*Cum-tank! Rape-sleeve! Hero-hole!*\"\n\nThe words blur together but I understand them all. My pussy clenches with each degrading name, responding to the rhythm. He notices.\n\n\"Oh ho! Cunt knows Goblish better than ye do!\" He reaches under, grabs one swinging tit, SQUEEZES. \"This udder knows what '*milk-sack*' means! This arse knows '*breed-mount*'!\"\n\nHis other hand yanks my hair back harder, forcing me to arch like a bow. The angle changes everything. Now his cock curves up inside me, dragging against something that makes my whole body seize. Every nerve ending lights up at once.\n\n\"NO!\" I try to scream but it comes out as another moan. \"Ahhhh-haaaahn!\"\n\n\"That's the spot!\" He rabbit-fucks that angle, quick shallow thrusts that make obscene *pliplipliplip* sounds. \"That's what makes hero-cunts cream! Right... THERE!\"\n\nSomething's building inside me. I knew pleasure as a man—quick lightning, then silence. This is no lightning. This is a tide with teeth, rising from my toes, unhurried, knowing it has already won. My thighs shake uncontrollably. My pussy spasms around him in waves.\n\n\"Oh fuck oh fuck oh FUCK—\" The words pour out in a feminine whimper. \"Something's—I can't—\"\n\n\"Bout to pop, ain't ye?\" He SLAMS deep and grinds, stirring his cock inside me. \"Bout to cum on the cock of something ye stepped on! How's that for honor?\"\n\nI think of the wives we rescued from goblin dens. Their hollow eyes. Their swollen bellies. The way they begged to go back. Now I understand. Now I'm becoming one of them, moaning like livestock while this disease of a creature ruins me.\n\n\"Please—\" I don't even know what I'm begging for anymore. \"Please please please—\"\n\n\"Bet ye never made yer wife sound like this.\" He pounds harder, his breathing getting ragged. \"Bet she never moaned like a bitch in heat. But one thrust of gobbo cock and ye're HOWLIN'!\"\n\nHe's right. The sounds coming from my throat aren't human. They're animal. Desperate. Each thrust pulls out another piece of my dignity and replaces it with need. My pussy has become a creature separate from me, sucking at him, trying to milk out what it wants.\n\n[Image: My ass ripples and claps, the meat bouncing independently of my will.\nHis sweat drips onto my back—thick and oily, stinking of onions and unwashed flesh. It mingles with mine, our scents mixing into something feral. His tongue suddenly drags up my neck, rough as tree bark, leaving a trail of thick saliva that makes my skin crawl and tighten simultaneously.\n\n\"Gonna make ye cum.\" He bites my ear, teeth like broken glass. \"Gonna make the great Aldric cum on gobbo cock. Then gonna pump ye full of babies. Green babies. Dozens of 'em.\"\n\nThe mental image—my body swollen with goblin spawn—should disgust me. Instead, my pussy clenches so hard he groans.\n\n\"FUCK! Grippin' like ye want it!\" He speeds up, balls slapping a frantic rhythm against my clit. *PLAPLAPLAPLAPLAPPLAP* \"Want them babies, don't ye? Want to be a gobbo incubator!\"\n\n\"No!\" But even as I deny it, that terrifying pressure builds higher. My vision edges with white. My whole body draws tight as a bowstring. \"I won't—I can't—I'm not going to—\"\n\n\"Yes ye are.\" He reaches around, finds my clit with uncanny accuracy, PINCHES. \"Cum for me, hero. Show me what ye really are.\"\n\nThe pressure crests. I'm standing on the edge of something vast and terrible. My pussy spasms around his cock in pre-orgasmic flutters. Everything in me screams to let go, to fall into it, to surrender.\n\nBut I can't. I WON'T. I'm Aldric the Great. I've resisted torture. I've endured dragonfire. I can resist this base animal response. I HAVE to.\n\n\"Come on, cow-tits!\" He's fucking me like he's trying to split me in half. Each thrust bottoms out with a wet SMACK, his cock battering something deep inside that sends shockwaves through my whole body. \"Let it go! Cream on me cock! Show me what human cunts are for!\"\n\nMy eyes roll back. My mouth hangs open, drool running onto the ground. Every muscle in my body is locked in that horrible space right before release. My pussy is a vice around his cock, rippling and squeezing, trying to milk out his cum.\n\n[Minigame]]I bite down on my own hair to muffle the sound trying to escape. Black strands between my teeth, tasting of lavender and shame. My mouth floods with spit I can't swallow. The fullness—Eon's bones, the FULLNESS. Like someone shoved a wine bottle up inside me. Like being stuffed with a LOG hot meat. My walls stretch and reshape around him, every ridge of his cock carved into my channel like a mold.\n\nHe pulls back slowly, dragging every bump and ridge through my stretched entrance. The suction makes an obscene *SHHHHLLLLUUUURP* like pulling a boot from mud. My pussy tries to hold him, gripping and releasing in waves I can't control. Just the head remains inside, my lips wrapped around his glans like they're trying to polish it.\n\nThen he SLAMS forward again.\n\n*PLAP!*\n\nHis balls swing up and slap that spot again. My whole body lurches forward from the impact, tits swinging like temple bells, clapping together with meaty *WHAP-WHAP* sounds. The metal triangles cut deeper into my flesh with each swing.\n\n\"Listen to that!\" He starts a rhythm now, pulling out slow, slamming in hard. *SHLORP... PLAP! SHLORP... PLAP!* \"Yer cunt's singin' for me!\"\n\nEach thrust makes different sounds. When he pulls out, my pussy makes these embarrassing sucking noises, like it doesn't want to let go. When he slams in, the wet SQUELCH echoes through the forest. His balls create their own percussion—SLAP-SLAP-SLAP against my clit, each impact making that strange button throb harder.\n\n\"Look at them cheeks dance!\"\n\nHe spreads his toes wider on my ass, and I feel every detail—the rough skin, the sharp nails, the way he uses my ass like handles. My cheeks clap together with each thrust, the sound mixing with everything else into a display of meat-on-meat violence.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-SQUELCH-PLAP*\n\nI try to drop my hips, to deny him the angle, but his grip on my hair keeps me bent like a bow. Tears stream down my face, dripping onto my swinging tits. Hay needles stick to the sweaty flesh. My armor jingles frantically—*ching-ching-ching*—as everything bounces and swings.\n\n\"Gonna cum already?\" He leans forward, and I feel his pot belly rest on my lower back, his weight pressing me down while his cock presses up. \"Can feel ye squeezin'. Pussy's milkin' me like a cow's teat!\"\n\nHe's right. I can feel my walls clenching and releasing around him in waves. Each time he bottoms out, hitting something deep inside that makes stars explode behind my eyes, the clenching gets stronger. My pussy is trying to eat him, to swallow him whole, to keep him inside where he's stirring up sensations I don't have words for.\n\nHis spit lands between my shoulder blades—a hot glob that runs down my spine like a snail. He follows it with his tongue, dragging the rough muscle from my neck to my ear. It feels like wet sandpaper, leaves a trail of onion-stink saliva that mixes with my honeyed sweat.\n\n\"Bet ye never made yer wife's cunt this wet,\" he grunts in my ear. \"Listen—\"\n\nHe stops thrusting for a moment, just grinding deep. The wet sounds are obscene—*squish-squish-squish*—as his cock stirs my pussy like a mortar and pestle. I can feel myself dripping around him, running down my thighs in shameful rivers.\n\n\"Please—\" The word comes out muffled around my hair. \"Please stop—\"\n\n\"Stop? When yer pussy's suckin' me this good?\" He starts thrusting again, harder. \"When ye're drippin' like a broken fountain?\"\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\nThe rhythm builds. His tiny hands grip my hips now, fingers barely reaching around to my belly, using them like handles to pull me back onto his cock. Each thrust drives deeper, harder. The wet sounds get louder, nastier. My pussy makes these horrible churning noises, like butter being violently mixed.\n\n\"All them human women,\" he pants, his breath hot on my neck, \"they all cum on goblin cock. Every one. It's what yer holes are for. Goblin sheaths. Cock-polishers.\"\n\nI shake my head violently, hair whipping. But the pressure is building. Something deep in my belly, behind where his cock keeps punching. A heat that spreads outward with each thrust, makes my thighs shake, my fingers dig into the dirt.\n\n\"Here's the deal,\" he says, and I can hear the grin in his voice. \"If ye don't cum, we go back to the suckin' deal. Seven days, then freedom.\"\n\nHope flares through the building pressure.\n\n\"But WHEN ye cum—\" He emphasizes it with a particularly brutal thrust that makes my eyes roll back. \"When ye cum on me cock like the cock-sleeve ye are, then I breed ye. Fill that hero-womb with goblin babies. Make ye forget ye were ever anything but a cum-toilet.\"\n\nHis thrusts get erratic now, but somehow more devastating. The angle changes slightly and suddenly he's hitting something that makes my whole body seize. That button of flesh his balls keep slapping swells, throbs, sends waves of unwanted pleasure through my core.\n\n\"Feel it buildin'?\" He's gleeful now, his cock swelling even thicker inside me. \"Feel that hero pussy gettin' ready to surrender? To admit what it's for?\"\n\nI do feel it. This pressure like I need to piss but different, deeper. My pussy clenches around him in rhythms I don't control. The wet sounds get even louder as I flood around his cock, my body preparing for something, begging for something.\n\nImages flash through my mind as I fight the building sensation—goblin raids I've stopped, villages burning, women found months later with swollen bellies and empty eyes. That's what he wants me to become.\n\n\"NO!\" I scream around my hair, biting down harder.\n\n\"YES!\" He howls back, jackhammering now. His cock pistons in and out so fast the sounds blur together—*PLAPLAPLAPLAPLAPPLAP*—his balls beating against my clit like a drum.\n\n[Image: My ass ripples and claps, the meat bouncing independently of my will.\nMy tits swing so violently they actually hurt, slapping against my ribs, against each other, against the ground. The metal triangles have shifted completely, my nipples dragging through dirt with each swing. My ass ripples and claps, the meat bouncing independently of my will.\n\n\"GOBBO COCK WINS!\" He shouts in Goblish, then Common, then Goblish again. \"HERO CUNT LOSES! ALWAYS! ALWAYS!\"\n\nThe pressure crests. Right at the edge. My pussy spasms around him, trying to pull him deeper, to keep him inside, to—\n\nNo. NO. I'm Aldric. I'm a hero. I don't cum on goblin cock. I DON'T—\n\nBut my body doesn't care what I am. It only knows what it needs.\n\n[Minigame]]",

The muscles I never had before ripple down his length, milking from base to tip like a throat swallowing.\n\n\"There it is!\" Snib squeals, grinding deeper. \"Feel that cunt beggin'! SQUEEZIN' me like she's thirsty!\"\n\nThe sensation blooms first in my toes—they curl like burning parchment. Then it climbs my legs like sap rising toward hungry sun, slow and inevitable, and my thighs shake with the weight of its coming. My pussy starts doing something I can't control—*clenching* in waves, each squeeze tighter than the last, like my body's trying to crack his cock like a walnut.\n\n\"No no no NO—\"\n\nBut the warmth is already flooding my belly. Not the quick spike I remember from being male—this is like drowning from the inside out. Heat pools heavy in my guts, spreading outward in thick honey-waves. My whole pelvis feels like it's melting, turning to hot wax around his shaft.\n\nThen my pussy CLAMPS.\n\n\"AAAAAHHHHHHHNNNNNNN!\"\n\n[Video]\n\nThe sound tears from my throat—not a scream but something worse. A SQUEAL. High and breaking, the kind of noise sows make when mounted. My voice cracks into nonsense—\"NGHHHAAAAA-HAAAAAHN!\"—as my pussy goes absolutely fucking INSANE around his cock.\n\n\"FUCK YEAH!

A SQUEAL.\nThe orgasm doesn't peak—it ROLLS through me in waves. My pussy becomes a fist, crushing down on him so hard I feel every wart, every vein imprinting inside me. Each clench sends lightning through my spine, making my back arch until I'm bent like a bow. My tits swing up and SLAP back down, the metal triangles jangling like dinner bells.\n\n\"Look at ye GRIP!\" He's laughing, delighted. \"Cunt's suckin' me like a baby on a tit!\"\n\nThen something else happens. Pressure in my belly—different from the orgasm. Like I need to piss but DEEPER. The feeling builds as my pussy spasms, and suddenly—\n\n*SPLOOOOOORRRRT!*\n\nHot liquid JETS out around his cock, spraying backward in a pressurized stream. It splashes against his balls, his thighs, runs down my legs in rivers. The shame should kill me but my body doesn't care—it keeps GUSHING.\n\n\"PISSING YERSELF?\" Snib cackles, pounding through my orgasm.\n\n*SQUIRRRT-SPLASH-SQUIRRRT!*\n\nEach thrust pushes out another jet. I can hear it hitting the floor behind us—wet splashes like someone's dumping buckets. My pussy won't stop clamping, won't stop gushing. It's like my body's trying to push him out and pull him deeper simultaneously.\n\n\"PLEASE—\" I don't even know what I'm begging for. \"PLEASE—HNNNGH—FUCK—\"\n\n[Image: Each thrust pushes out another jet.\n\n\"Listen to them noises!\" He grinds his hips, stirring his cock inside my spasming walls. \"Moanin' like a bitch! Squealin' like a sow! Where's the hero now?\"\n\nMy eyes roll back. My tongue lolls out. The orgasm keeps GOING — rolling into another peak before the first one dies, stacking, compounding. Every clench squeezes out more fluid with obscene *SPLORT-SPLASH* sounds. I'm emptying from both ends — tears from my eyes, shame from my cunt.\n\n\"Twenty seconds!\" Snib counts gleefully. \"Still cummin'! Still squirtin'! Bet ye never came like THIS with a cock!\"\n\nHe's right. As a man, orgasm was a quick release. This is complete body possession. Every nerve is firing. My nipples feel like they're being electrocuted by a spell. That new little bundle of flesh his balls keep spanking—the thing that used to be my cock-throbs like a second heartbeat. Even my TEETH feel the pleasure somehow.\n\n\"Gonna go deeper,\" he grunts, pulling my hair until my spine screams. \"Gonna put it where no human cock can reach.\"\n\nHe pulls back slightly, then RAMS forward with his entire weight. Something inside me—some barrier I didn't know existed—stretches. I feel it resist for one terrifying moment, then—\n\n*POP!*\n\nHis cockhead punches through into someplace DEEPER. The sensation is instant—like being stabbed with hot iron, but also like scratching an itch I never knew I had. My whole body seizes. This orgasm on top of orgasm makes my vision go black at the edges.\n\n\"GAAAAAAHHHHHHTHRAAACCK!\"\n\nThe word-scream that comes out doesn't sound human. My pussy CLAMPS so hard on his base that he groans. But the head—the fat purple head is somewhere else now. Somewhere that makes my whole belly feel FULL in a way that's completely wrong.\n\n[Image: I can feel it flexing in there, that mushroom head flaring wider, LOCKING itself in place.\n\"IN YER BABY-CHAMBER NOW!\" He announces triumphantly.\n\nThe words don't make sense but the FEELING does. He's deeper than deep. His cockhead is lodged somewhere that evolution never meant to be touched. I can feel it flexing in there, that mushroom head flaring wider, LOCKING itself in place.\n\n\"Please—\" I sob, still cumming, still squirting. \"Please, it's too deep—\"\n\n\"This is where babies get made!\" He grinds, stirring his cockhead in that forbidden space. \"Where gobbo babies get planted in humie-wombs!\"\n\nEach tiny movement in there sends fresh waves through me. My orgasm has become something else—something continuous, broken. My pussy just keeps squeezing, keeps gushing. The puddle under us is spreading. My thighs are soaked. His balls are dripping with my shame.\n\nMy tits hang like dead weight, nipples dragging in the dirt I've turned to mud with my own fluids. The metal triangles jangle with each spasm. My ass jiggles constantly from my shaking thighs. Everything about my body is in full surrender—moaning, squirting, clenching, CUMMING endlessly on the cock of something I killed dozens of.\n\n\"What would yer wife think?\" He yanks my hair, making me arch more. \"Seein' her husband—NGHH—squirtin' like a whore? Moanin' like livestock?\"\n\nThe image of Elara burns through my orgasm-fried brain. This morning I was trying to put a baby in her. Now I'm—\n\n*SPLOOOOORT!*\n\nAnother massive gush as my pussy clenches. The shame makes it WORSE, makes me cum HARDER. My body is betraying everything I was with each spasm, each squirt, each pathetic moan.\n\n\"Ye LOST,\" Snib declares, his cock throbbing in my womb.\n\nHe starts fucking that deep place. Short, brutal thrusts that don't pull out of my womb, just stir it. The sensation is indescribable—like being fucked in my stomach, in my soul. My orgasm finally starts to ebb but leaves me shaking, aftershocks making my pussy clench weakly around him.\n\n\"Now fer my turn,\" he grunts, speeding up.\n\n]My whole body screams for release. Every nerve begs to let go, to tumble into that vast warm ocean of sensation building in my guts. My pussy ripples around his cock in pre-orgasmic flutters, trying to milk him without my permission.\n\nBut I'm Aldric the Great. I've held my breath underwater for five minutes. I've stayed conscious through torture. I've walked on broken legs.\n\nI can resist THIS.\n\n\"HNNNGH—NO!\" I grit my teeth so hard my jaw cracks. \"I won't—FUCK—won't cum for you!\"\n\n[Image: I think of Elara. Her auburn hair. Her laugh. The way she looked at me this morning with such love.\nI think of Elara. Her auburn hair. Her laugh. The way she looked at me this morning with such love. That's who I am—her HUSBAND. Not this meat-puppet with a goblin's cock splitting me open. The image anchors me, pulls me back from the edge.\n\n\"Stubborn cunt!\" Snib pounds harder, his balls creating a violent rhythm against my clit. *PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP* \"Ye're gonna cum! All humie women cum on gobbo cock!\"\n\nThe pressure builds higher. My thighs shake so hard they cramp. My pussy clenches and releases, clenches and releases, right on that knife's edge. One more thrust, one more grind, and I'll tip over. But I hold it back through pure will, the same iron discipline that let me stand vigil for three days straight.\n\n\"I'm—ALDRIC—\" I force the words through clenched teeth. \"Not—your—WHORE!\"\n\n\"HAH! Still fightin'?\" He yanks my hair back harder, forcing my spine to arch until it screams. \"Let's see how long that lasts!\"\n\nSuddenly he pulls out completely. The wet *SCHLOOOORP* of his exit makes my empty pussy clench on nothing. Before I can process the relief, his hands grab my hips.\n\n\"Up! Legs straight! Keep that arse HIGH!\"\n\nHe pushes and pulls, maneuvering me like a doll. My face stays pressed to the dirt but my legs straighten, locking at the knees. My ass points straight at the ceiling, so high my spine curves down at an obscene angle. The position makes my pussy gape open, drooling clear strands of shame onto the floor.\n\n\"There we go!\" He climbs back onto my ass, his feet finding purchase on my cheeks like they're stirrups. \"Proper breedin' position!\"\n\nHis cock—that massive green log—points straight down at my exposed hole. I feel the fat purple head kiss my entrance. Then he just... DROPS.\n\n*SPLOOORTCH!*\n\nHis entire weight drives his cock down into me like a spear from heaven. Every inch rams through my pussy in one brutal gravity-assisted thrust. His balls SMACK against my mound with the sound of wet leather hitting stone.\n\n\"GAAAHHH!\" The scream tears from my throat.\n\nThis angle—Flux's balls, this ANGLE. His cock curves differently, dragging against places that make my vision white out. My legs shake, trying to hold the position while this creature uses my ass like a trampoline.\n\n*PLAP!* Up. *PLAP!* Down. *PLAP!* Up. *PLAP!* Down.\n\n[Image: left]\nHe's not even thrusting—just using his weight, bouncing on my ass while his cock pistons in and out. Each drop drives him balls-deep, the head punching my deepest parts. Each rise drags him almost completely out, my pussy lips clinging to his shaft like they don't want to let go.\n\n\"Look at them cheeks RIPPLE!\" He grabs handfuls of my ass, sinking his clawed fingers deep into the soft meat. \"Fat fuckin' arse made fer gobbos to ride!\"\n\nMy tits swing like wrecking balls with each impact. They collide under me—*WHAP-WHAP*—sending the metal triangles jangling. My nipples drag through dirt I've turned to mud with my own drool. The collar around my neck clinks with each bounce.\n\n\"Still not cummin'?\" He increases his pace, really SLAMMING down now. \"Let's fix that!\"\n\nHe spreads my ass cheeks wider with his hands, and I feel cool air hit my asshole. Then—horror—his thumb presses against it.\n\n\"NO! Not there—\"\n\n\"Just a little poke!\" His thumb pushes inside to the first knuckle.\n\nThe dual sensation—his cock destroying my pussy while his thumb violates my ass—sends fresh waves through me. That pressure builds again, twice as fast, twice as strong. My pussy starts that terrible clenching, that rolling squeeze that signals defeat.\n\n\"There it is!\" He crows, feeling me tighten. \"There's that hungry cunt wakin' up!\"\n\n\"I won't—HNNGH—won't cum—\"\n\n\"Ye will.\" He DROPS down particularly hard, bottoming out with a wet SPLAT. \"Know how I know?\"\n\nHe leans forward, his pot belly pressing against my lower back, his breath hot on my ear.\n\n\"'Cause yer already drippin'. Been drippin' since I stuck it in. Yer cunt LOVES gobbo cock, even if yer brain don't.\"\n\nHe's right. I can hear it—the wet SQUELCH-SQUELCH-SQUELCH with each bounce. My pussy is sopping, making obscene sounds as he pile-drives into me. Each impact sends little sprays of my wetness flying.\n\n\"Elara!\" I gasp her name like a prayer. \"Elara, I'm sorry, I'm trying—\"\n\n\"Gonna count ye down!\" He announces gleefully. \"Ten thrusts till ye cream!\"\n\n\"NO!\"\n\n\"TEN!\" *SLAM* His cock drives so deep I taste it in my throat somehow.\n\n\"NINE!\" *SLAM* My pussy clenches involuntarily.\n\n\"EIGHT!\" *SLAM* My clit throbs with its own heartbeat.\n\n\"SEVEN!\" *SLAM* My vision starts going white at the edges.\n\n\"SIX!\" *SLAM* My legs shake so hard the heel-spikes scrape against the floor.\n\n\"FIVE!\" *SLAM* A moan escapes despite my clenched teeth—\"Nnnnnghh!\"\n\n\"FOUR!\" *SLAM* My pussy starts that rolling clench that signals the edge.\n\n\"THREE!\" *SLAM* My whole body draws tight as a bowstring.\n\n\"TWO!\" *SLAM* The pressure becomes unbearable, unstoppable.\n\n\"ONE!\" *SLAM* He hilts and GRINDS, stirring his cock inside me.\n\n[Minigame]]",

      "text": "[Image: Even goblin precum can get you pregnant.\n\"Please—\" The word comes out as a broken whine, my voice cracking like a boy's. \"Please don't—not inside—\"\n\nBut I can FEEL it starting. His balls—those hairy, sweaty sacks that have been spanking my clit—suddenly draw up TIGHT against his body. They pulse against that sensitive nub, sending aftershock sparks through my still-spasming pussy.\n\n\"HERE IT COMES!\" Snib SQUEALS, his voice going shrill with pleasure. \"GONNA PAINT YER BABY-ROOM WHITE!\"\n\nHis whole body goes rigid on top of me. His pot belly presses harder into my lower back, his clawed toes digging into my ass cheeks for purchase. I feel his cock SWELL inside me—not just throb but actually expand, stretching my already-abused walls wider.\n\nThen the first pulse.\n\nI don't see it but Eon's bones, I FEEL it. His cock lurches like a kicked snake, the shaft rippling from base to tip. Something HOT—hotter than blood, hotter than fever—jets into that deep place he's lodged himself.\n\n[Image: Even goblin precum can get you pregnant.\n\"NNNNGHHHHHAAAAAAHHHHH!\"\n\nThe noise he makes is pure animal pleasure. Not human at all. A chittering, squealing celebration of conquest. His whole weight—all sixty pounds of warty green flesh—shudders on my back.\n\nThe second pulse is STRONGER. I feel the cum traveling up his shaft like watching a snake swallow an egg—that bulge of fluid racing through the underside of his cock before—\n\nIt fires into my womb with actual FORCE. Like someone turned on a hose inside me. The heat is immediate, spreading through my belly like drinking mulled wine but WRONG, so wrong, because it's inside parts that should never feel warmth from outside.\n\n\"TAKE IT!\" He's babbling now, lost in his pleasure. \"TAKE ME GOBBO-BATTER! DRINK IT WITH YER WOMB!\"\n\nThird pulse. Fourth. Fifth. Each one pumps what feels like a ladleful of thick, clotted heat into me. I can feel my belly starting to extend—just slightly—as he fills that sacred space with his putrid seed.\n\nThe texture—Flux's balls, the TEXTURE. It's not liquid. It's more like... like hot porridge. Lumpy. I can feel chunks of something swimming in the thinner fluid. It CLINGS to my insides, coating everything, too thick to run back out around his cock-seal.\n\n\"So much,\" I whimper, my head hanging between my arms. \"Too much—\"\n\n\"SEVENTEEN MORE SPURTS!\" He announces gleefully, his cock lurching again.\n\nMy womb is FULL. Beyond full. I feel the pressure building as he keeps pumping, keeps filling. The overflow has nowhere to go but BACK, squeezing around his shaft in vulgar bubbles. I hear it—wet BLORP-BLORP sounds as cum forces its way out around his seal.\n\nThen I feel it on my thighs.\n\nTHICK. Like custard left in the sun. It doesn't run so much as OOZE down my legs in hot, chunky rivers. The smell hits next—concentrated rot, like cheese mixed with dead fish mixed with something medicinal. It makes my eyes water.\n\n\"FIFTEEN! SIXTEEN!\" He's counting his spurts like victory drumbeats. \"SEVENTEEN! EIGHTEEN!\"\n\nEach pulse makes my pussy clench involuntarily, milking him. My body is HELPING him breed me. The muscles I never asked for ripple along his length, coaxing out every drop of his nasty goblin sludge.\n\nThe heat is unbearable. It feels like he's filling me with boiling gravy. My whole belly radiates warmth from the inside out. Something WRITHES in there. His sperm are already swimming, already hunting, and I can feel every one of them like maggots in warm meat.\n\n\"TWENTY-THREE! TWENTY—GAAAHHHHH!\"\n\nHis final spurt is different. THICKER. It comes out in one long, continuous stream like he's pissing inside me. *GLOOOOOOOOOOOOORP*. The pressure is too much. My pussy lips make obscene farting sounds as air and cum bubble out around his shaft.\n\nHe pulls back slowly, his cockhead dragging through my womb's entrance with a wet *POP*. The moment he's out, it's like pulling a cork from a wine bottle.\n\nCum GUSHES from my gaped pussy. Not drips—FLOODS. It pours out in thick, chunky waves, splattering on the floor with heavy SPLAT-SPLAT-SPLAT sounds. I feel it running down both thighs, pooling around my knees. The smell is overwhelming—concentrated goblin musk mixed with my own shameful wetness.\n\nBut he's not done.\n\nStill standing on my ass, he aims his still-spurting cock at my back. One final rope of cum—impossibly long, like a white snake—shoots up my spine. It lands with a heavy SPLAT across my shoulder blades, up my neck, and—\n\nThe hot glob hits my forehead and runs down. Some gets in my hair. Some drips onto my lips.\n\nThe taste—\n\nI gag, spitting, but it's too late. That rancid thickness coats my tongue. Salty-sour-rotten, with chunks that pop between my teeth like fish eggs. My stomach heaves.\n\nFinally, FINALLY, he climbs off. My arms give out immediately. I collapse face-first into the puddle of our mixed fluids, my ass still up, pussy gaping and drooling his seed. I can feel it inside me still—so much of it, so DEEP. My womb feels like a water balloon filled with spoiled porridge.\n\n\"HAHAHA!\" Snib dances around to face me, his cock still dripping. \"LOOK AT YE! BRED PROPER!\"\n\nHe grabs my hair, yanks my head up. My face is a mess—tears, snot, drool, his cum. He WIPES his cock clean on my cheek, the smell making me gag again.\n\n\"That's GALLONS of baby-batter in ye now.\" He grins. \"Gobbo sperm swim fer DAYS. Probably already chewin' through whatever egg ye got in there.\"\n\nThe horror hits like cold water. The stories. The warnings. Goblin cum is hypervirile. One load can cause multiple pregnancies. And he just pumped enough inside me to breed a whole village.\n\n\"No,\" I whisper, feeling more glob out of my pussy. \"No, I can't be—\"\n\n\"Oh, ye're DEFINITELY knocked up.\" He scratches his deflating balls casually. \"Probably with twins. Maybe triplets. Gobbo seed doesn't miss.\"\n\nMy pussy is still gaping, still drooling. I can feel his cum MOVING inside me, seeking, hunting. My womb aches with fullness that won't drain—too thick, too deep, too clingy. It's not coming out. It's staying in there, doing what it's meant to do.\n\n\"Gonna be funny,\" Snib muses, \"watching yer belly swell with me spawn. The great Aldric, waddlin' around with gobbo babies kickin' inside.\"\n\nHe walks over to the corner, and I hear liquid splashing. He's PISSING. The stream hits the floor, steaming in the cool air. Then he turns—\n\nThe hot stream hits my back. He's pissing ON me. The stream hits the small of my back like warm rain and I flinch — not from pain but from the sheer DOMESTICITY of it. Like watering a plant. Like he's done this a hundred times. It pools in the hollow of my spine, overflows down my ribs, mixes with cooling cum into a slurry that smells like a stable after a hot week. His piss is thicker than a man's, yellower, and it STAINS. I can feel it dyeing my skin.\n\n\"Welcome to yer new life, breed-mare,\" he says cheerfully, shaking off the last drops on my ass. \"We got LOTS more fun ahead.\"]I can't form real words anymore, just these pathetic mewling sounds. My pussy is still twitching from the aftershocks, little clenches that make wet squelching noises around his shaft.\n\n\"Here it comes, cow!\"\n\nI feel his whole body go rigid on top of me. His clawed toes dig deeper into my ass cheeks. His breathing catches—one sharp inhale through his nose that whistles. Then his balls—those hairy, sweat-slick sacks that have been spanking my clit—draw up TIGHT against my soaked lips.\n\n\"GRAAAAAAHHHHK!\"\n\nThe squeal he makes isn't human. It's pure animal pleasure, high and chittering. His cock inside me starts doing something—a rhythmic FLEX I can feel all the way in my guts. The head flares wider in that deep forbidden place, swelling like a fist opening.\n\nThen I feel... warmth.\n\nNot like precum. This is different. THICKER. A heavy, liquid heat that blooms in my deepest parts. The sensation is so alien—I've never had anything IN me before, let alone—\n\n\"BREEDING YE!\" He squeals, grinding his hips. \"PUMPIN' YE FULL!\"\n\nAnother flex. Another bloom of heat. This time I feel the FORCE of it—like he's pissing inside me but thicker, nastier. The warmth spreads through my belly in waves. My womb—that's what he called it—starts to feel FULL. Not stretched but OCCUPIED. Like something heavy and warm is pooling in there.\n\nI can HEAR it. The wet sounds of his release echoing inside me. Each pulse makes a nauseating *GLORP* as it floods that deep chamber. The heat keeps building—so much hotter than my own body temperature that it feels like molten porridge being poured into my guts.\n\n\"Take it all!\" He's grinding in circles, stirring his cocktip in my womb while he empties. \"Every—NGHH—fuckin'—DROP!\"\n\n[Image: Even goblin precum can get you pregnant.\nI feel it starting to back up. That deep space can only hold so much before it overflows back into my pussy. The first backwash is nauseating—chunky and hot, with a texture like... like spoiled milk mixed with mucus. It oozes around his still-pulsing shaft, trying to find a way out.\n\n\"So much,\" I whimper, my voice broken. \"Too much—\"\n\n\"Gobbo balls make LOTS!\" Another pulse. Another impossible amount flooding in. \"Gonna give ye triplets at LEAST!\"\n\nThe backup gets worse. I feel pressure building as my womb fills beyond capacity. Then it happens—the seal breaks. Hot, thick SLOP starts pushing out around his cock with obscene *SPLORRRT* sounds. It's nothing like the clear fluid I squirted. This is WHITE-YELLOW, clumpy, moving like library paste heated over a fire.\n\nThe smell hits me as it splashes on my thighs. Concentrated ROT mixed with yeast, like bread dough left in the sun for days. It's so thick it doesn't run—it GLOPS down in heavy strings that steam in the cool air.\n\n\"Nine spurts!\" He counts gleefully. \"Ten! ELEVEN! Feel them swimmers!\"\n\nSwimmers. I can actually FEEL something in the sludge. Movement that isn't just liquid flow. Like tiny things wriggling, burrowing, seeking. The thought makes me gag but my womb keeps taking it, some primitive part of my body ACCEPTING this violation.\n\nThe sounds get wetter as overflow increases. I feel hot ropes splashing down my inner thighs, pooling under me where I'm collapsed. Each pulse pushes out more of what's already inside, but he keeps adding to it. My whole lower body feels STUFFED with the nasty paste.\n\n\"Gonna pull out,\" he warns, grinding one last time. \"Watch this!\"\n\nThe withdrawal is obscene. As his cockhead pops free from my womb, there's a moment of resistance—then a FLOOD. All that backed-up sludge comes pouring out in one massive *SPLOOOOOOSH*. It's like someone turned over a bucket of warm, chunky yogurt between my legs.\n\nBut he's not done. As he pulls fully out, his cock—still spurting—paints a line up my back. I feel the hot splash travel up my spine, over my neck—\n\nA massive rope of cum lands across my face. It's so heavy it makes an actual SMACK sound when it hits. The texture—Flux's balls, the TEXTURE. Like warm jelly with chunks of something harder mixed in. It bisects my forehead, crosses my nose, and the tail end lands on my lips.\n\nI try to spit but my mouth opens at the wrong moment. The taste—\n\nAcid mixed with rotted milk mixed with something FUNGAL. It coats my tongue instantly, thick as paste. I gag, cough, but that just makes me inhale and the smell goes straight to my brain. My eyes water. My sinuses burn.\n\n\"HAHA! Glazed like a sweet roll!\" He's still standing on my ass, his cock drooling the last few spurts onto my hair. \"Proper cum-frosted!\"\n\nMy arms give out. I collapse face-first into the puddle of our mixed fluids. The impact makes everything SQUELCH. Hot goblin sludge BURPS out of my pussy in bubbles. I can feel it deep inside, coating everything, marking me from the inside out.\n\n\"Knocked up fer sure,\" Snib declares, finally climbing off my ass. \"No human cunt survives that much gobbo-seed without gettin' stuffed with babies.\"\n\nThe words hit like ice water. Pregnant. The stories. The women found in goblin dens, bellies swollen with green spawn. That's going to be me. There's no way that much... that much SLUDGE inside me won't take root.\n\nMy pussy is still occasionally spurting out thick glops with wet *PLOP* sounds. I can feel it bubbling inside me, fermenting, doing its work. The smell is everywhere—in my hair, on my face, leaking from between my legs. I'll never be clean again.\n\n\"This is yer life now,\" Snib says conversationally, wiping his still-drooling cock on my hair. \"Gobbo cum-dump. Gonna fill ye every day until ye pop out greenlings.\"\n\nI try to form words but all that comes out is a broken sob. My body won't stop shaking. Won't stop occasionally clenching and pushing out another glob of his seed with humiliating *SPLORT* sounds.\n\nThen I hear him position himself differently. A new sound—steady splashing.\n\nHe's PISSING on me. The stream is hot, ammonia-sharp, hitting the small of my back and running down to mix with all the other fluids. He aims it between my ass cheeks, the pressure washing some of his cum out of my still-gaping pussy.\n\n\"Markin' me property,\" he explains cheerfully. \"So everyone knows ye're owned.\"\n\nThe piss seems endless. It pools around me, mixing with cum and my own shameful squirt into a puddle of total degradation. When he finally finishes, he gives his cock a few shakes, the drops hitting my ass.\n\n\"Welcome to yer new life, Elise,\" he says. \"Bet ye wish ye'd just sucked it now, eh?\"\n\nI lie there in the filth, feeling his seed working inside me, knowing with absolute certainty that Aldric the Great is dead. All that's left is this cum-stuffed body that's about to grow goblin babies.\n\n[Choice: Three months later...",

      "text": "\"ONE!\" He hilts and GRINDS, stirring his cock inside me like he's churning butter.\n\nThe dam breaks.\n\n[Video]\n\nNot like cresting a wave—like someone reached inside and YANKED my guts out through my pussy. My whole body seizes, every muscle locking at once. Then the first clench hits.\n\nEvery muscle from my asshole to my belly button SEIZES at once — a rolling crush that starts at my stretched entrance and ripples inward, each ring of muscle firing a half-second after the last like a throat swallowing. The sensation of my own insides squeezing is almost worse than the cock they're squeezing AROUND — I can feel the ridges of my own pussy walls, feel them gripping warts and veins I've memorized against my will.\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHH!\"\n\nThe scream tears from my throat — high, breaking, nothing like any sound I've made in thirty-two years of life. My hair whips across my face and STICKS to the tears and drool, black strands glued to my open mouth, caught between my teeth. I sound like the whores in Eboncrest's cheaper brothels, the ones who moan for coin. But they were faking.\n\nBut I'm not faking. My pussy is WRINGING his cock in waves. Each clench stronger than the last, like my body is trying to crush this invader even as it worships it. The sensation radiates out from where we're joined—hot pulses shooting down my thighs, up my spine, making my toes curl in the metal boots until they cramp.\n\n[Image: The scream tears from my throat—high, breaking, nothing like any sound I've made in thirty-two years of life.\n\"THERE IT IS!\" Snib crows, feeling me spasm around him. \"HERO-CUNT CUMMIN' ON GOBBO COCK!\"\n\nHe keeps bouncing, using my orgasming pussy like a toy. Each drop drives another wave through me. My vision goes white, then sparkles with stars. Every nerve ending fires at once—not pain, not pleasure, but something that transcends both. Like being turned inside out through my cunt.\n\nThen pressure BREAKS somewhere deep — like a blister popping inside me. Something hot and urgent gushes out around his cock with a force I can't control, can't even clench against.\n\n*SPLURRRRRT!*\n\n\"FUCK YEAH! SQUIRTIN' LIKE A FOUNTAIN!\"\n\nIt's not piss. It comes from deeper, from where his cock has rearranged my insides. Each orgasmic clench SQUEEZES it out like wringing a rag — a hot jet that sprays against his swinging balls and spatters back onto my own thighs. I can feel every drop leaving me. I can feel myself EMPTYING. And the emptier I get, the harder my pussy clenches trying to fill the void with HIM.\n\n*SPLURT-SQUIRT-SPLURRRT!*\n\n\"Listen to that!\" He spreads my ass cheeks wider, making the sounds echo. \"Pissin' yerself from cummin'! Aldric the Great, pissin' like a bitch!\"\n\nMy mouth hangs open, drool running freely. My eyes roll back until I see only white.\n\nMy pussy is LEARNING him. Each clench prints his shape deeper into my walls — the curved ridge below his cockhead, the cluster of warts halfway down that scrape like cobblestones, the fat vein on the underside that pulses against my g-spot. This body is making a mold of him, a negative-space cast of goblin cock that nothing else could ever fill properly again.\n\n\"HNNNNGH! AHHH! AHHHHH!\"\n\nThe moans pour out uncontrolled. Each one higher, more desperate than the last. My tits have been bouncing for so long that the ligaments connecting them to my chest BURN — a deep, hot ache like I've been punched repeatedly in the sternum. Each slam against the ground drives the pain deeper. The metal triangles shifted aside ages ago, and now my bare nipples — swollen, oversensitive, scraping through mud made from my own drool and tears — send jolts of something that isn't quite pain and isn't quite pleasure straight to my clenching cunt.\n\n\"THAT'S IT! MILK ME COCK! SQUEEZE IT!\"\n\n[Image: Aldric the Great, pissing like a bitch.\n\nHe DROPS particularly hard and something inside me... gives.\n\n*POP!*\n\n\"AAAAIIIIEEEEE!\"\n\nThe scream is inhuman. He's pushed through something, some barrier deep inside. The head of his cock is somewhere it shouldn't be—somewhere NOTHING should be. It feels like he's in my stomach but lower, like he's invaded some sacred space that's never been touched.\n\n\"HAH! POPPED YER CHERRY PROPER!\" He grinds, stirring his cockhead in this new violated space. \"That's yer baby-room! That's where me spawn gonna grow!\"\n\nMy womb. He's in my womb. The organ I never had until today is wrapped around his cockhead like a glove. I can feel it—this hollow ache filled with goblin meat, this violation so complete it rewrites what I am.\n\n\"Please—\" I sob, but my pussy keeps cumming, keeps squirting around him. \"Please, it's too deep—\"\n\n\"Never too deep for breeding!\" He starts short, brutal thrusts that keep his head lodged in my womb while his shaft pistons through my canal. \"Feel that? That's yer womb learnin' its purpose! Gonna flush it with gobbo cum!\"\n\nThe orgasm won't stop. It rolls through me in waves, each one making me squirt more. The floor beneath us is soaked, puddles of my shame spreading outward. My pussy makes obscene SQUELCH-SQUIRT-SQUELCH sounds as he fucks me through it.\n\n\"Count 'em!\" He commands, yanking my hair. \"Count yer squirts!\"\n\n\"I—I can't—AHHHHH!\"\n\n*SPLURRRT!*\n\n\"That's one!\"\n\n\"Stop—please—\"\n\n*SQUIRT-SQUIRT!*\n\n\"Two and three! Keep goin'!\"\n\n[Image: My womb. He's in my womb.\nMy pussy clenches again, another wave of fluid gushing out. I've never felt anything like this—like my insides are melting and pouring out around his cock. Each squirt feels like pissing but FROM INSIDE, like my pussy is sobbing its defeat in liquid form.\n\n\"Four! Five! SIX!\" He counts gleefully as I spray. \"Aldric the Great, squirtin' like a virgin on her first cock!\"\n\nMy legs shake so hard the metal heels scrape grooves in the floor. My ass jiggles with each impact, the meat clapping around his tiny hips. He weighs nothing but he's completely in control, riding my ass like a captain steering a ship.\n\n\"Gonna pump ye full now,\" he grunts, his thrusts getting erratic. \"Gonna flood that virgin womb with gobbo babies. All because ye came on me cock like a whore.\"\n\n\"No—\" But even as I protest, my pussy clenches around him, trying to milk out exactly what he's promising. My body has betrayed me completely. Aldric would never cum from being fucked. But this body—this terrible, hypersexual body—was MADE for this.\n\n\"Yes,\" he corrects, grinding deep. \"Ye lost the bet. Ye came. Now ye get bred.\"\n\nHis cock flexes inside my womb and I feel it—the first pulse of what's coming. His balls draw up tight against my soaked pussy. His breathing gets ragged.\n\n\"Here it comes, cow-tits. Here comes yer first batch of gobbo babies!\"\n\n[[Image: My pussy drips and clenches and BEGS to cum, but my mind holds it back like a fist around a throat.\n\"ONE!\" He hilts and GRINDS, stirring his cock inside me like he's churning butter.\n\nThe pressure builds to impossible levels. My pussy starts that terrible clenching, that rolling squeeze that means defeat. Every muscle draws tight. My vision whites out at the edges. I'm about to—\n\nNo.\n\nNO.\n\nI slam my consciousness down like a portcullis dropping. The same iron will that let me hold position while dragonfire scorched the air above. The same discipline that kept me silent under torture. I build walls in my mind—stone by stone, thought by thought. Elara's face. My sword hand. The oath I swore. Each memory a brick against the pleasure trying to drown me.\n\nMy pussy spasms AROUND the edge but doesn't tip over. I hover there—one heartbeat, two, three—right on that knife's edge of orgasm but NOT FALLING.\n\n\"What—\" Snib feels it, the way I clench but don't cream. \"What're ye—NO! Ye can't—\"\n\n\"I'm—ALDRIC—THE—GREAT!\" Each word forced through gritted teeth as I hold back the wave by pure fucking will.\n\nHe SLAMS down harder, trying to force it. His cock pounds that deep spot that makes stars explode. But I've found something deeper—some core of resistance that even this body can't override. My pussy drips and clenches and BEGS to cum, but my mind holds it back like a fist around a throat.\n\n\"What—\" Snib sounds genuinely confused. \"Why ain't ye—ye were RIGHT THERE!\"\n\n\"Because—\" I gasp through gritted teeth. \"I'm not—your—WHORE!\"\n\n\"Stubborn CUNT!\" He yanks out suddenly.\n\nThe wet *SCHLOOOORP* of his exit makes my empty pussy clench on nothing. Before I can process the relief, he's shoving me, rolling me over like a sack of grain. I land on my back with a meaty THUD, tits bouncing up into my face before settling into pools of flesh spreading toward my armpits.\n\n\"Let's try somethin' else then!\"\n\nHis clawed hands grab the metal triangles barely containing my tits. With a casual gesture, they fall away—the armor responding to him, not me. My breasts spill completely free, pale mountains topped with pink peaks already hard from the cold and... and everything else.\n\n\"Look at these udders!\" He grabs one in each hand, fingers sinking deep into the soft flesh. \"Bigger than me head!\"\n\nThen he leans down and LATCHES onto my left nipple.\n\n\"AHHHHH!\"\n\n[Image: My back arches involuntarily, pushing more tit into his face.\n\nThe sensation—Eon's mercy, I've never felt anything like it. His mouth is hot, wet, his tongue rough as tree bark as it swirls around the sensitive peak. He SUCKS, hard, like he's trying to pull something out of me. My back arches involuntarily, pushing more tit into his face.\n\n*SLURP-SUCK-SLURP*\n\n\"Mmmm,\" he hums against my breast, the vibration traveling straight to my empty pussy. \"Taste like ye're ready to make milk.\"\n\nHe releases that nipple with a wet POP and attacks the other one, sucking so hard it borders on pain. His teeth scrape the sensitive flesh, making me gasp. Meanwhile his hands SQUEEZE and KNEAD, treating my tits like dough he's working.\n\n\"Know what these are for?\" He asks between sucks, looking up at me with those yellow eyes. \"These ain't for lookin' pretty. These are MILK-SACKS.\"\n\n*SLAP!*\n\nHis palm connects with my right tit, making it bounce and collide with the left. The impact sends shockwaves through the soft tissue.\n\n\"Soon gonna have six, seven splurtlings hangin' off these.\" He grins, pinching both nipples and PULLING until my back arches off the ground. \"Little green pups with their teeth sinkin' into these fat nipples, suckin' ye dry.\"\n\n\"No—please—\"\n\n\"Oh yes.\" He goes back to sucking, alternating between violent suction and gentle licks that make my pussy clench. \"But here's the thing—ye won't be eatin' normal food no more.\"\n\nI try to focus on anything else—the dirt floor, the smell of rot, the collar's cold weight—but his mouth on my nipples sends lightning straight to my cunt. The sensation is overwhelming, like being attacked by pleasure at a point I can't defend.\n\n\"Gonna put ye on a special diet.\" He talks between sucks, spittle flying. \"Just one thing. Can ye guess what?\"\n\n\"Every mornin', noon, and night—\" *SUCK* \"—ye'll be drainin' me balls—\" *SLURP* \"—right down that pretty throat.\"\n\n\"I won't—\"\n\n\"Ye will.\" He bites down on my nipple, not hard enough to break skin but enough to make me cry out. \"See, gobbo cum's got everythin' a breedin' bitch needs. Proteins for the pups growin' in yer belly. Fats to make these tits swell with milk.\"\n\nHe demonstrates by grabbing both breasts and SHAKING them, watching them jiggle. My face burns with humiliation.\n\n\"Three meals a day of thick, hot nut-sludge.\" He grins at my expression. \"Down yer throat, fillin' yer belly. Ye'll forget what real food tastes like. Just the taste of me balls drainin' into ye.\"\n\nMy pussy CLENCHES at the mental image. I hate it, hate how my body responds, but it's like these new parts have their own will.\n\n\"And the best part?\" He sucks my nipple so hard I see stars. \"The more gobbo cum ye drink, the more milk these udders make.\"\n\nHe paints the picture with horrifying clarity: \"Ye'll wake up with these milk-tanks so full they hurt, beggin' me to bring the pups to drain 'em. Six little mouths with sharp teeth, chompin' down while ye cry. And while they're suckin' one batch of milk out yer tits, I'll be pumpin' the next batch of babies into yer cunt.\"\n\n\"Stop—stop talking—\"\n\n\"Couple months and ye won't even remember bein' human.\" He moves to my right breast, sucking so hard my heel-boots scrape against the floor. \"Just a milk-cow for gobbos. These tits hangin' to yer belly, swingin' when ye crawl. Yer ass gettin' even fatter from all that cum.\"\n\nHis hands are everywhere—squeezing, slapping, pinching. My tits feel like they're on fire, every nerve ending singing. Despite my horror, my back arches, pushing them up toward his mouth. My pussy drools steadily, making wet spots on the dirt.\n\n\"Please—\" I don't even know what I'm begging for anymore.\n\n\"Ye'll WANT it.\" He grins up at me, my nipple between his teeth. \"Week of drinkin' nothin' but gobbo cum and yer brain starts changin'. Ye'll wake up CRAVIN' the taste. Crawl to me beggin' for breakfast. 'Please Master Snib, me belly's empty, need yer thick cum to fill it.'\"\n\nI'm panting now, my chest heaving, making my tits bounce with each breath. He takes advantage, motorboating between them, his face disappearing into my cleavage while making disgusting BRRRRR sounds.\n\n\"Ye'll measure time by feedings.\" His voice is muffled by tit-flesh. \"Morning skull-fuck. Noon cockmilking. Evening gulp-session. Maybe midnight snack if ye're good.\"\n\nHe emerges, face flushed, and starts SLAPPING my tits in rhythm. Left-right-left-right, watching them bounce and collide.\n\n\"Month from now, ye won't remember the taste of bread. Just cum. Thick, chunky gobbo cum slidin' down yer throat. Yer tits'll learn too—start leakin' just from the smell of me cock.\"\n\nMy nipples are so hard they hurt. The mental image he's painting horrifies me. But my body responds like it's receiving instructions.\n\n\"And the pups...\" He grins wider. \"Twenty, thirty of 'em within a year. All suckin' these tits while their brothers grow in yer belly. Ye'll forget ye ever had a name. Just 'Milk-cow' or 'Cum-tank' or whatever we call ye.\"\n\nHe sits back, admiring his work. My tits are covered in his spit, shining in the dim light, marked with teeth impressions. My nipples throb with each heartbeat. I'm gasping, writhing, my pussy so wet I can feel it pooling beneath me.\n\nThat's when he positions himself between my spread legs. I'm on my back now, completely naked except for these ridiculous heel-boots pointing at the ceiling. I can see everything—his warty green body, his pot belly, that massive cock pointing at my entrance like a weapon.\n\nHe notches the purple head against my pussy lips. Just resting there. Waiting.\n\n\"Ready for round two, cow-tits?\"",

      "text": "[Image: Even goblin precum can get you pregnant.\nI try to pull away but my body won't obey. His cockhead lodged in my womb acts like an anchor—when I try to crawl forward, it tugs at something so deep inside that my vision sparkles. My pussy is still clenching in aftershocks, each spasm making me aware of how thoroughly he's hilted in me.\n\n\"Where ye goin'?\" He laughs, grabbing my hips. \"Can't run with gobbo cock in yer baby-room!\"\n\nI manage to waddle forward maybe an inch, my spread thighs shaking, but the angle—face pressed to dirt, ass pointed at the ceiling—means his cock just slides deeper when I move. It's like I'm impaled on a spit, unable to dismount.\n\nThat's when I feel it.\n\nHis breathing changes. Quick little grunts—\"*hungh-hungh-hungh*\"—like a dog about to vomit. His fingers dig into my ass cheeks so hard I'll have bruises. Through the haze of my own orgasm, reality crashes down:\n\nHe's about to cum.\n\nInside me.\n\nIn my womb.\n\n\"No no no NO—\"\n\nHis balls—those heavy, hairy sacks that have been slapping against me—suddenly draw up tight. They press against that sensitive button between my legs, the thing that used to be the root of my cock, sending another unwanted jolt through me. But worse is what I feel through them—a churning, like something thick being pumped through tubes.\n\n\"HERE IT COMES!\" He squeals—actually SQUEALS like a pig finding slop.\n\nThe first pulse.\n\nI feel his cock swell inside me, stretching my already-abused walls. Then—\n\nSomething hot. Hotter than blood. It jets into that deep place where his cockhead sits, splashing against walls that have never felt anything before. The sensation is so alien my brain can't process it—just registers WRONG, INVASION, TOO DEEP.\n\n\"TAKE IT! FUCKING TAKE IT!\"\n\nThe second rope is thicker. I can feel the texture of it through my insides—not liquid but something between porridge and curdled milk, chunky and viscous. It floods that hollow space, and I feel my womb... expand? Like a waterskin being filled, but inside me.\n\n\"All fer you!\" He grunts, grinding deeper.\n\nMore. So much more. Each pulse is accompanied by his high-pitched squealing, like he's in religious ecstasy. I feel the cum pooling in my womb, hot and heavy, churning with each flex of his cock. Some of it backflows into my pussy, and that's when I realize—\n\nIt's MOVING.\n\n\"Not just flowing but... writhing? Like thick soup with chunks that swim on their own. The heat of it makes my insides cramp. My pussy clenches involuntarily, milking him for more of this vile seed.\n\n\"Feel that?\" He pants between spurts. \"That's gobbo baby-batter! Gonna knock ye up fer sure!\"\n\nMy womb is full. Beyond full. I feel the pressure building as he keeps cumming, nowhere for it to go. Then—overflow. Hot, thick ropes squirt out around his cock with obscene *SPLORTCH* sounds, running down my thighs in chunky streams.\n\nThe smell hits me—concentrated rot mixed with cheese that's gone liquid in summer sun, underlaid with something chemical, something ALIVE. It coats my nostrils, makes my eyes water. This isn't human seed—it's some kind of biological weapon.\n\n\"Still cummin'!\" He announces gleefully. \"Gobbo balls hold more than human heads!\"\n\nA particularly thick rope—I feel chunks push through his cockhole, spreading me from inside as they travel into my womb. Like cottage cheese being piped through a pastry bag. Some of it immediately backflows, and I feel the texture as it oozes out—stringy, sticky, forming bridges between my thighs that refuse to break.\n\nMy face is pressed into dirt but I can see between my legs—white-yellow slime pooling beneath me, still steaming in the cool air. Actual steam, like fresh bread but wrong, diseased. The puddle grows with each pulse.\n\n[Image: The puddle grows with each pulse.\n\n\"Nine... ten... ELEVEN!\" He counts his spurts.\n\nFinally, FINALLY, I feel him pulling out. The wet SCHLOOOOOORP as his cock exits makes me gag. Without his cockhead corking me, the cum FLOODS out.\n\nIt pours from my gaped pussy in a thick, chunky stream. I feel every lump, every string as it exits. My womb contracts, pushing more out, but there's so much. SO MUCH. It keeps coming, bubbling out like a broken sewer pipe.\n\nBut he's not done.\n\nStill standing on my ass, he aims his still-spurting cock at my back.\n\n*SPLAT*\n\nA rope as thick as ship rope lands between my shoulder blades, hot enough to burn. It oozes down my spine, pooling in the small of my back. Another rope—*SPLAT*—across the back of my head, tangling in my hair. The weight of it, the heat, the STENCH—\n\nThe final spurt arcs over my head and—\n\n*GLOP*\n\nLands directly on my face. Across my forehead, over my nose, and—I try to close my mouth but I'm panting—on my tongue.\n\nThe taste.\n\nLike licking a latrine. Like cheese aged in a corpse. I gag, spit, but it's too thick, too sticky. It clings to my tongue, coats my throat.\n\n\"HAH! Glazed like a festival cake!\"\n\nHe hops down. Without his weight pinning me, I collapse forward into the puddle of our combined fluids. My tits splash into the cooling cum. My face lands in dirt turned to mud by various fluids. I feel his seed still bubbling out of me, my pussy making obscene *BLORP-BLORP* sounds as it empties.\n\n\"Look at that cream-pie!\" He walks around to face me, his softening cock still drooling. \"Proper bred now!\"\n\nHe grabs my hair, lifts my cum-covered face, and uses my black locks to wipe his cock clean. The casual degradation of it—using me like a rag—breaks something inside me.\n\nWhen he lets go, I collapse completely. Cum still oozing from my gaped pussy. His seed swimming in my womb. The knowledge crushing me:\n\nI'm pregnant.\n\nNo way I'm not, from that.\n\n\"Gonna love carrying me babies,\" he says cheerfully, already pulling his loincloth back on. \"Gobbo spawn are proper active in the womb. Gonna feel 'em swimming around in there within a sennight!\"\n\nHe whistles as he walks to his pile of furs, leaving me face-down in a puddle of cum, pussy still occasionally spurting out another glob with obscene *BLORT* sounds.\n\n\"Oh!\" He turns back. \"Almost forgot!\"\n\nI hear him walk back over. Then warmth—different warmth—splashing on my back.\n\nHe's pissing on me.\n\nThe stream is heavy, ammonia-strong, marking me like territory. It mixes with the cum, creating a vile slurry that pools around my collapsed form. The final humiliation—not even worth proper acknowledgment, just something to piss on after use.\n\n\"There we go,\" he sighs with relief. \"Properly marked now. Sweet dreams, cow-tits. Tomorrow we start yer new life proper.\"\n\nI lie there, cum bubbling from my pussy, piss cooling on my back, the absolute certainty crushing me:\n\nAldric the Great is pregnant with goblin spawn.\"No! No no NO! Don't cum inside! Please, I'm begging—\"\n\n\"Too late, cow-tits!\"\n\nHis claws dig into my ass cheeks, anchoring himself. I try to pull forward but I CAN'T—his cockhead lodged in my womb acts like a fishhook, keeping me speared. My legs are spread wide in these fucking heels, thighs burning from the position, pussy stretched around his base like a too-small glove around a fist.\n\nThen I feel it.\n\nHis balls—those hairy, sweaty sacks that have been slapping against me—draw up tight. They press against my soaked pussy lips, against that sensitive nub where my cock used to be. The pressure makes me gasp, a stupid little aftershock of pleasure even as terror floods through me.\n\n\"Hnnnnggghhhh—\"\n\nThat's his sound. This wet, guttural grunt of pleasure that vibrates through his whole body. I feel it through his cock—the first pulse, like a heartbeat but wrong. The shaft swells thicker inside me, stretching my already-abused walls.\n\nSomething hot blooms deep in my belly.\n\nNot on my belly. IN it. In that violated space where his cockhead sits. The first spurt is just warmth, spreading like spilled soup inside me. But thick soup. Porridge left too long on the fire.\n\n\"TAKE IT!\" He squeals, his voice cracking with pleasure. \"TAKE ME GOBBO-SLOP!\"\n\nThe second pulse. Stronger. I feel the cum traveling up his shaft—actually FEEL it moving through the tube of his cock like pudding through a baker's pipe. Then it SPURTS against my inner walls with enough force that I gasp.\n\nThat's the sound it makes inside me. Wet and thick and wrong.\n\n\"Please stop—\" But my protest is cut off by the third pulse.\n\nThis one's different. Chunkier. Like he's pumping custard with lumps in it. I feel the solid bits hitting my womb walls, sticking, spreading. The heat is overwhelming—like someone poured fresh-boiled porridge straight into my guts.\n\n\"BREEDIN' YE!\" He's losing his mind with pleasure, his whole tiny body shaking on top of my ass. \"PLANTIN' ME FLAG IN HERO-CUNT!\"\n\nThe sounds get wetter, nastier. Each pulse pumps more of his vile seed into me. I can't see it but I can FEEL it—the way it doesn't flow like liquid should. It's stringy, connected, pulling at itself as it fills me. Like the way honey pours but thicker, hotter, more alive.\n\nMy womb is full. Beyond full. But he keeps cumming.\n\n\"So much—\" I whimper. \"Too much—\"\n\nThe pressure builds until I feel it backflow into my pussy, oozing around his shaft. Then—horror—it starts dripping out.\n\n*SPLAT*\n\nThe first glob hits the floor between my spread legs. I catch a glimpse of it—yellowish-white like pus, thick as pudding, with darker chunks swimming in it. The smell hits immediately: sour milk mixed with something bleachy, something that burns my nostrils.\n\n\"Look at it leak!\" He grunts, still pumping. \"Yer cunt can't hold it all!\"\n\nMore pulses. Five. Six. Seven. Each one weaker but still substantial. The cum gets thicker toward the end—the last spurts are almost solid, like curdled cream being forced through a sieve. I feel them stick inside me, coating my walls, refusing to flow back out.\n\n\"There we go,\" he sighs with satisfaction. \"Proper bred now.\"\n\nHe pulls back slowly. His cockhead POPS free from my womb with a wet sucking sound that makes me sob. Then the rest of his shaft drags out, each inch making obscene squelching noises as my pussy tries to close behind it.\n\nThe moment he's out, it's like pulling a cork from a wine bottle.\n\nHis cum GUSHES from my gaped pussy, pouring out in thick ropes. It hits the floor with heavy splats, pooling between my legs. The consistency is horrifying—some parts liquid, some parts cottage cheese chunks, some parts long strings that won't break. It's HOT, steaming in the cool air of the hut.\n\nBut he's not done.\n\nStill standing on my ass, he aims his still-hard cock at my back.\n\n*SPLURT*\n\nA final rope of cum shoots out, traveling the length of my spine. It lands with a heavy SPLAT from my lower back all the way up to—\n\n*PLAP*\n\nRight across my face. The hot string of goblin cum bisects my forehead, crosses my nose, and the end lands on my lips. I taste it immediately—sour and thick and WRONG, like spoiled milk mixed with salt and something fungal.\n\n\"PFFFFT—\" I spit, gag, try to get it off my tongue, but it CLINGS. Sticky like tree sap but alive somehow.\n\nMy arms give out. I collapse face-first into the dirt, my ass still raised, cum pouring from my pussy in obscene gushes. Each pulse of my traitorous cunt pushes out more—*BLORP... BLORP... BLORP*—like my womb is vomiting up his seed.\n\nBut I can feel what stayed inside. The thick stuff. The chunky stuff. The stuff that's already swimming deeper, looking for—\n\n\"Knocked up fer sure,\" Snib announces cheerfully, hopping off my ass. \"That was prime breeding shot. Backed up fer days, that was.\"\n\nHe walks around to my face, his cock still dripping. Without warning, he wipes it on my hair—long strokes, cleaning off the cum and pussy juice.\n\n\"This is yer life now,\" he says conversationally. \"Gettin' bred daily. Maybe twice daily once yer belly starts showin'.\"\n\nI know the stories. Every woman taken by goblins. The rescue parties finding them months later, bellies swollen with—\n\nNo.\n\nBut I felt it. The sheer VOLUME of what he pumped into me. The thickness of it, designed to stick, to stay, to take root. My womb is FLOODED with goblin seed. There's no way—absolutely no way—I'm not...\n\nPregnant.\n\nThe word hits like a physical blow.\n\nI'm going to have a goblin baby. Maybe multiple. Those chunky, swimming things are already hunting for eggs, and this body—this horrible, hypersexual body—probably has plenty.\n\n\"Give it a few months,\" Snib says, already pulling his loincloth back on. \"Ye'll be beggin' fer more. They always do.\"\n\nThen, as final insult, he stands over me and I hear his stream start.\n\n*PSSSSSSSSS*\n\nHot piss splashes across my back, mixing with the cum already coating me. The stream is heavy, steady, marking me like territory. It pools in the small of my back before running down my sides.\n\n\"There we go,\" he sighs with relief. \"Properly marked inside and out.\"\n\nThe combined stench—cum and piss and my own shameful wetness—makes me retch. But I can't move. Can't do anything but lie here in the puddle of our mixed fluids, feeling his seed swimming inside me, looking for purchase.\n\n\"Welcome to yer new life, Elise,\" he says, giving my ass a final slap. \"Hero to bred bitch in one day. Must be a record.\"]My mind floats in orgasm aftershocks, pussy still clenching weakly around the log of green meat speared through me. Can't think. Can't move. Face pressed to dirt, ass pointed at the ceiling like a breeding mare, this massive cock lodged somewhere past where cocks should go.\n\nThen I feel it—his breathing changes.\n\nQuick little huffs against my lower back where his pot belly rests. His clawed toes dig deeper into my ass cheeks, finding purchase in the soft meat. The cock buried in my guts... flexes. Just once. A strong pulse that makes my oversensitive walls squeeze back involuntarily.\n\n\"Hehehehe...\" His giggle is wet, excited. \"Here it comes, hero. Here comes yer first taste of gobbo baby-batter.\"\n\nHis balls—those hairy sacks that have been slapping my clit—draw up tight. I feel them contract against my soaked pussy lips, the coarse hair scratching my oversensitive flesh. They pull up so hard they actually lift slightly, and that pressure against what used to be where my cock attached sends a stupid aftershock through me.\n\n\"Nnngh—wait—\"\n\nBut he's already started making this sound. This... squealing. High-pitched and victorious, like a pig finding truffles. His whole little body shudders on top of mine.\n\n\"HNNNNNGGGGHHHHH!\"\n\nThe first sensation is just... warmth. Deep warmth, spreading somewhere behind my belly button. His cock swells thicker—I feel my pussy walls stretch to accommodate—and then—\n\nSomething hot and thick shoots into that violated space inside me. Not a spray but a heavy, sluggish rope that I feel the weight of. Like someone pouring warm porridge directly into my guts, except it's... moving? Writhing?\n\n\"TAKE IT!\" He squeals, grinding deeper. \"TAKE ME FUCKIN' NUT!\"\n\nAnother rope. This one I feel more clearly—the journey of it through his cock, the pulse traveling up the shaft buried in me, the moment it erupts from his tip. It's so thick I can feel it coiling inside my womb like rope being fed into a sack.\n\n\"First rope for Grotch!\" He grunts, yanking my hair. \"Second for Pustule!\"\n\nMy eyes go wide. He's... he's actually doing it. Cumming inside me. A goblin is ejaculating in my womb. The thought hits like ice water but my pussy responds with another traitorous squeeze, milking him.\n\nThe sound comes from inside me—wet, thick, like stirring day-old porridge. Each rope lands heavy and hot, and now I'm starting to feel the texture through my walls. It's not liquid. It's... chunky? Clotted? Like cottage cheese being squeezed from a bag, complete with lumps that I feel depositing inside me.\n\n\"Fuck yeah, milk it! Squeeze out every drop!\"\n\nHis pleasure-sounds are obscene. Grunting and squealing and chittering in Goblish. His cock throbs so hard I feel it in my spine, each pulse delivering another serving of that thick, nasty soup. The smell hits next—seeping out around his shaft, a bleachy, yeasty stench like bread dough mixed with rotted fish.\n\n\"So much,\" I whimper, feeling my womb starting to bloat. \"Too much—\"\n\n\"Never enough for breedin'!\" He grinds his hips, stirring the mess inside me. \"Gonna pack ye so full of cum ye'll taste it!\"\n\nHe's not stopping. The spurts blend together into one continuous flow, like he's pissing cum into my womb. I feel it filling every space, backing up into my tubes, the pressure building. My lower belly starts to pooch out slightly from the sheer volume.\n\nThen I feel it bubbling back.\n\n*BLORT*\n\nThe first overflow squeezes out around his shaft, and the sensation makes me gag. It's so THICK. Like warm glue mixed with snot, clinging to my pussy walls as it's forced out by the pressure of more cum flooding in. It doesn't drip—it GLOOPS down my thigh in a chunky strand.\n\n\"Look at that!\" He cackles, still cumming. \"Overflowin' already! Packed to the brim with gobbo cream!\"\n\nHis cock gives a particularly strong throb and I feel something else—harder chunks shooting through. Like tapioca pearls but warm and alive, wriggling as they travel up his shaft and deposit in my womb. Some kind of concentrated sperm-sacs that will dissolve later, ensuring pregnancy.\n\n\"Those are me special swimmers,\" he explains gleefully, feeling me tense. \"Gonna burrow right into yer eggs. Probably got twins cookin' already!\"\n\nThe horror of it—pregnant, with GOBLIN spawn—makes me try to pull forward, but his cock is lodged in my womb like a cork. I can't move. Can only stay there as he floods my insides with his nasty, backed-up nut.\n\nThe spurts finally start slowing, but now they're even thicker. Pure jelly-worms of concentrated sperm, so dense I feel each one land like a dollop of warm pudding. My womb is so full it aches, stretched with goblin semen, definitely fertilized, definitely conquered.\n\n\"One more,\" he grunts, and gives a final thrust.\n\nThis last rope is pure sludge—I feel it squeeze through his cock like toothpaste, depositing directly against what must be my cervix. It's so thick it doesn't flow, just sits there like a plug, sealing everything inside.\n\n\"There we go,\" he sighs with satisfaction. \"Properly bred.\"\n\nHe pulls out slowly, and the wet *SSSSCHLOOOOOOORP* of exit makes me want to die. My pussy, gaped and ruined, immediately starts belching out overflow. Not dripping—GUSHING. Thick ropes of yellowed cum splurt from my hole in rhythm with my heartbeat.\n\n*BLORT... BLORT... BLORT...*\n\nBut most of it stays inside. I can feel it, dense and warm and strong, packed into my womb like caulk in a crack. Already doing its work. Already rewriting what I am.\n\n\"Hmm,\" Snib says thoughtfully, still standing on my ass. \"Missed a spot.\"\n\nI hear him grunt, then feel something hot and wet splatter across my back. Another rope of cum, this one painting a line from my ass up my spine. It lands with a heavy SPLAT, then another across my shoulders, and then—\n\n*SPLAT*\n\nRight across my face. The rope hits my forehead with actual WEIGHT — a warm, heavy line that sags into my eyebrow, slides down the bridge of my nose, and the tail end swings into my open mouth like a pendulum finding rest. It sits on my tongue, thick as rendered fat, and I feel individual LUMPS in it before the taste registers. Like licking a fish market floor mixed with cheese that's gone liquid in the sun. Something pops between my teeth — a clot, firm as a pea, bursting sour. I spit and spit but it coats my tongue like oil.\n\n\"Perfect,\" he says, finally climbing down.\n\nMy legs give out immediately. I collapse into the puddle of cum and squirt I've made, feeling more goblin semen burble out of my pussy as I fall. It pools around my hips, thick and warm and stinking.\n\n\"Ye know what this means, right?\" Snib walks around to face me, his cock still dripping. \"That much gobbo cum, straight in yer womb? Yer definitely pregnant. Probably with triplets, way I flooded ye.\"\n\nHe grabs my hair, lifts my cum-covered face, and wipes his cock clean on my cheek. The casual dominance of it—using my face as a rag—breaks something in me.\n\n\"Welcome to yer new life, cow-tits. Gonna be squirtin' out green babies in a few month—gobbo babies grow fast.\"\n\nHe stretches, balls swinging freely, then walks behind me. I hear him grunt again, and then—\n\n*PSSSSSSSSSSSSS*\n\nHot piss splashes across my ass, washing away the external cum but doing nothing about the gallons packed inside me. The stream is thick and yellow, steaming in the cool air, marking me like an animal marks territory.\n\n\"Mine now,\" he says simply, shaking the last drops onto my back. \"Bred and marked. Proper gobbo property.\"\n\nHe leaves me there—face down in mud made from dirt and cum and piss, womb packed with goblin semen, pussy still weakly gushing overflow. My mind can't process it. Aldric the Great, hero of Eboncrest, just got bred by a three-foot goblin.\n\nPregnant. I'm going to be pregnant with goblin babies. The thought makes me retch, but also... my pussy clenches, squeezing out another glob of cum with a wet *BLORT*.\n\n[Choice: Months later...",

      "text": "I stay silent and glare up at him, jaw clenched so tight my teeth ache.\n\n\"Ooh, scary face from me cock-cushion!\" He grins wider, that massive green shaft with its bruised-purple head still notched between my pussy lips. \"Let's see how long that lasts.\"\n\nHe pushes forward—not hard, just steady pressure. The head spreads my entrance like a fist forcing through a coinpurse. I feel every ridge, every wart, every throbbing vein as he feeds that log of meat back into me, inch by terrible inch.\n\n\"There it goes!\" He cackles, watching my face. \"The hero's mask crackin' already!\"\n\nHe's only halfway in but I already feel split open, reorganized around his thickness. My pussy clings to every bump and ridge like it's trying to memorize the shape. The fullness—Flux's balls, the FULLNESS. Like being stuffed with hot iron that pulses with its own heartbeat.\n\nThen he drops his full weight and SLAMS the rest home.\n\n*SPLORTCH!*\n\nHis hairy balls SMACK against my ass with a wet crack that echoes off the hut walls. The impact forces all the air from my lungs in a pathetic \"HUNNH!\"\n\n\"Better!\" He grabs my ankles—his hands barely wrap around them—and spreads my legs WIDE, forcing my knees toward my shoulders. The position makes my pussy gape even more around his base. \"Now I can see everything jiggling!\"\n\nHe pulls back slowly, and I feel my insides trying to follow, clinging to his shaft like they don't want to let go. When just the head remains, stretching my entrance, he pauses.\n\n\"Watch yer tits.\"\n\nBefore I can process the warning—WHAM! He pile-drives down with his full weight.\n\nMy spit-slick tits — still glazed with his drool, still bearing purple tooth-marks — fly up and the left one SMACKS me full in the face. The weight of it against my cheek, the wet heat of my own breast-flesh pressed over my mouth and nose, the goblin spit transferring to my skin — I taste it. Onion-rot and my own honeyed sweat. They drop back, then fly up again as he finds his rhythm, and now BOTH hit me, one across each eye, warm dough slapping my face like I'm being smothered by my own body.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\n\"HAH! Gettin' slapped by yer own udders!\" He leans forward, and suddenly his face is buried between them, his pot belly pressing against my mound. \"Gonna use these as handles!\"\n\nHis hands grab the sides of my tits, fingers sinking deep into the soft flesh. He uses them for leverage, pulling himself deeper with each thrust. The angle changes everything—now his cock curves up inside me, dragging against something that makes stars explode behind my eyes.\n\nI try to maintain the glare but my eyes keep rolling back. Try to keep my mouth closed but gasps keep escaping. The fullness is... it's everything. Like he's rearranging my guts to make room. Like my body is just a sheath he's breaking in.\n\n\"Look at me.\" His voice drops to something darker. \"LOOK at who owns ye.\"\n\nI force my eyes to focus on his face. Those yellow eyes boring into mine, pupils dilated with lust. His mouth hangs open, black tongue lolling out, dripping spit onto my tits. His expression is pure animal satisfaction—a predator that's caught its prey and is savoring every moment of consumption.\n\n\"That's it. Watch while I ruin ye.\" He changes rhythm—three quick rabbit-thrusts then one DEEP grind. \"Watch while gobbo cock rewrites yer insides.\"\n\n*plipplipplip-GRIIIND*\n\nThe grinding is worse than the thrusting. I can feel him stirring inside me like a spoon in honey, his cock head mashing against my deepest parts. My legs shake in his grip. That pressure is building again, that terrible warm weight in my belly.\n\nSuddenly he hawks back and SPITS.\n\nThe glob of yellow-green phlegm lands directly in my open mouth. Thick, warm, tasting of rot and onions. I try to spit it out but he clamps his hand over my mouth.\n\n\"Swallow.\"\n\nThe collar pulses. A warning.\n\nI swallow his spit. Feel it slide down my throat like a slug.\n\n\"Good cow! Yer learnin'!\" He goes back to pounding, each thrust making wet SQUELCH-PLAP sounds. \"Know what yer pussy feels like? Cock-polisher. All them ridges inside, scrubbin' me clean!\"\n\nHe's right. I can feel every fold of my insides gripping him, massaging his shaft whether I want to or not. My body has become a tool for his pleasure.\n\n\"Gonna tell ye a secret.\" He leans close, his breath hot on my face. \"Yer pussy? It's changin'. Adaptin'. Learnin' the shape of gobbo cock.\"\n\nHe demonstrates with a particularly brutal thrust that makes my whole body jolt.\n\n\"Soon it won't fit nothin' else. Just gobbo. Just mine.\"\n\n\"You're—HNNH—lying—\"\n\n\"Collar won't let me lie direct.\" He grins wider. \"Yer cunt's already feelin' different'. Tighter here—\" thrust \"—looser here—\" grind \"—perfect gobbo-sleeve.\"\n\nHe releases my legs and they fall to either side, spread wide. Now he can lean fully forward, his whole weight on me. His face disappears into my cleavage again but this time he BITES down on the soft flesh between my tits, not hard enough to break skin but enough to leave marks.\n\n\"MMMMPH!\" He motorboats between them while still pounding, making disgusting BRRRRRR sounds mixed with the PLAP-PLAP-PLAP of his balls on my ass.\n\nWhen he emerges, his face is flushed green-dark, eyes wild.\n\n\"Here, let me help!\"\n\nHe grabs my tits and pushes them together around his face, using them like pillows while he fucks me. His tongue drags across whatever flesh he can reach—long, rough licks that leave trails of thick spit.\n\nThe position means his pubic bone grinds against my clit with each thrust. That bundle of nerves I didn't know existed as a man, now sending lightning through my whole body. The pressure builds faster, hotter.\n\n\"No no no—\" I pant, but it comes out muffled by my own tits pressed against my face by his grip.\n\n\"Yes yes YES!\" He mocks. \"The hero's hungry fuck-hole wants to cum!\"\n\nHe pulls my tits apart and they SLAP back together with a wet clap. Then he does something worse—he starts varying his rhythm. Two slow, one fast. Then five fast, one slow. Then grinding circles. My body can't predict it, can't prepare, just has to take whatever he gives.\n\n\"This is what ye are now.\" He punctuates each word with a thrust. \"Gobbo. Cock. Holster.\"\n\n*SLAM. SLAM. SLAM.*\n\n\"Yer throat?\" *THRUST* \"Cock-sheath.\"\n\n\"Yer tits?\" *SLAM* \"Fuck-handles.\"\n\n\"Yer whole body?\" He grinds deep, stirring. \"Breeding furniture.\"\n\nThe mental image—me reduced to an object, a thing with convenient holes—somehow makes my pussy clench harder around him.\n\n\"OH! She likes that!\" He feels the squeeze. \"The hero wants to be furniture!\"\n\n\"I don't—FUCK—want—\"\n\nHe cuts me off by leaning down and dragging his tongue from my chin to my forehead in one long, slow lick. His spit is thick, viscous, cooling immediately in the air. I can feel it on my face like a snail trail of ownership.\n\n\"Liar.\" He grins down at me, tongue still hanging out, dripping. \"Yer cunt's tellin' the truth even if yer mouth won't.\"\n\nHe's right. My pussy is GUSHING around him, each thrust accompanied by obscene wet sounds. SQUELCH-SQUISH-SQUELCH. Like someone stomping through a marsh.\n\n\"Listen to it!\" He slows down just to emphasize the sounds. \"That's yer hungry hero-hole beggin' for gobbo babies!\"\n\nThe slow pace is torture. I can feel every inch sliding in and out, my walls clinging desperately. The fullness, then the emptiness, then the fullness again. My hips start moving without permission, trying to match his rhythm.\n\n\"There she goes!\" He crows. \"Pussy's takin' over! It knows what it needs!\"\n\nHe speeds up again, really HAMMERING now. His balls swing forward with such force they make drumbeat sounds against my ass. THWACK-THWACK-THWACK. The impact sends little shockwaves through my whole body.\n\n\"Gonna mark ye,\" he pants, getting winded from the effort. \"Gonna pump ye so full of cum ye'll taste it!\"\n\nThe threat should terrify me. Instead, that pressure in my belly coils tighter. My legs wrap around his small body without my permission, heels locking above his ass. The metal boots CLANG together.\n\n\"Look at that! Leggin' me like a proper whore!\" He reaches back and SLAPS my thigh. \"The hero wants her breedin'!\"\n\nMy tits have found their own rhythm now—figure-eights when he thrusts straight, circular when he grinds, flying up to hit my face when he SLAMS deep. They're like separate creatures, responding to his movements.\n\n\"Bet yer wife would cry if she saw ye like this,\" he pants, sweat dripping from his warty forehead onto my chest. \"Legs spread, pussy drippin', eyes rolled back like a breeding mare.\"\n\n\"Don't—mention—her—\"\n\n\"Why? Worried she'd be disgusted?\" He leans close, his breath hot on my ear. \"Or worried she'd be jealous ye never made her feel like this?\"\n\nThe words hit like physical blows because there's truth in them. I never made Elara feel anything like this. This overwhelmed. This completely owned. But that's because we were - we ARE - in a loving—\n\n\"There it is!\" He must see something in my face. \"The realization! Ye LIKE being the one gettin' fucked!\"\n\n\"NO!\"\n\n\"Yes! The great Aldric likes havin' his cunt stuffed!\"\n\nHe reaches between us and finds my clit again. Just a brush of his thumb but it's like lightning.\n\n\"AHHHHH!\"\n\n\"There's the button!\" He presses harder, rubbing circles while still pounding. \"The hero's cum-button!\"\n\nMy whole body draws tight, muscles locking, back arching off the ground.\n\n\"That's it!\" He speeds up everything—thrusts, circles, degradation. \"Cum for me, hero! Show me what ye really are! Cream on the cock of something ye stepped on!\"\n\nI'm right there. Right on the edge. My pussy is clenching in waves, trying to milk him. My mouth opens to scream and—\n\nHe leans down and LICKS my entire face again, from chin to hairline, his tongue rough and wet and disgusting.\"Please... no more...\"\n\nThe words barely escape my lips before he RAMS forward, spearing me completely in one brutal thrust that punches the air from my lungs.\n\n\"GAAAHHH!\"\n\nMy back arches off the dirt floor as he hilts himself, his hairy sack SMACKING against my ass with a wet *THWAP*. The impact sends my tits—still glazed with his thick spit—flying up into my face. They hit with enough force to make my teeth click, leaving trails of goblin saliva across my cheeks before dropping back down.\n\n\"There we go!\" He grabs my thighs, forcing them wider, spreading me like a wishbone about to snap. \"Now I can watch yer face while I breed ye proper!\"\n\nFrom this angle I can see everything—his warty green face twisted in a broken-glass grin, that nasty tongue lolling out the side of his mouth, dripping thick ropes of spit onto my bouncing tits. His pot belly presses against my mound with each thrust, the coarse hair on it scratching my sensitive skin.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\nHe starts a steady rhythm, pulling almost completely out before SLAMMING back down. Each impact makes my whole body jolt upward, tits flying in chaotic patterns—sometimes circling like stirred porridge, sometimes colliding in the middle with meaty CLAPs, sometimes shooting straight up to slap me in the face again.\n\n\"Look at me.\" His voice drops to a growl. \"LOOK AT ME while I rut ye!\"\n\nI can't help it. My eyes lock with his—those piss-yellow orbs that have probably watched other human women get bred. There's intelligence there now, the collar's gift, but underneath is pure animal instinct. The need to breed. To conquer. To plant his seed in the conquered hero's womb.\n\n\"That's it.\" He grins wider, showing all those broken teeth. \"Watch while a gobbo makes ye his bitch. Watch while somethin' ye used to step on OWNS yer cunt.\"\n\nHe shifts angle, pushing my knees back toward my chest. The position makes me even more helpless, completely open, my pussy lips stretched obscenely around his green shaft. I can see it disappearing into me with each thrust—that massive thing that shouldn't fit, that's reshaping my insides to accommodate it.\n\n\"Ye feel that?\" He grinds his hips in circles, stirring his cock inside me like he's churning butter. \"That's yer womb kissin' my cockhead. Beggin' for gobbo babies.\"\n\nI try to look away but he grabs my chin with one warty hand, forcing me to maintain eye contact. His thumb hooks into my mouth, pressing down on my tongue. The taste—onions and cock-sweat—makes me gag.\n\n\"Nah nah, keep watchin'. Want ye to see who's breeding ye.\"\n\nHe pulls his thumb out and SPITS. A thick yellow glob lands directly on my face, sliding down my cheek. Before I can react, he's grabbed both my wrists, pinning them above my head with one hand. His grip is iron—how is something so small so strong?\n\n\"Know what we do in the wild?\" He leans down, his breath hot and fetid on my face. \"When we catch a female?\"\n\n*SLAM-SLAM-SLAM*\n\nHis thrusts get harder, more violent. My tits are completely out of control now, swinging in wild figure-eights, the spit making them glisten in the dim light. The bite marks he left are turning purple, throbbing with each impact.\n\n\"We mark 'em.\" He bites down on my neck, HARD. His teeth break skin and I scream. \"We fuck 'em till they can't walk.\" Another bite, lower, on my collarbone. \"Then we breed 'em till they forget they were ever anything else.\"\n\nHis free hand grabs my left tit, SQUEEZING so hard I see stars. He's not gentle—he's mauling it, twisting the nipple, using it like a handle to pull himself deeper.\n\n\"Feel that, hero?\" He's panting now, his tongue hanging out, dripping spit onto my face with each word. \"Feel yer body learning what it's for? Not for swingin' swords. For takin' cock. For making babies.\"\n\nThe pressure is building again. That terrible, wonderful pressure that starts in my toes and climbs like rising flood water. My pussy is clenching around him in waves, trying to milk him even as my mind screams resistance.\n\n\"Yer cunt's suckin' me.\" He laughs, that wet phlegmy sound. \"Like a mouth tryin' to swallow. Hungry little hero-hole wants its meal.\"\n\nHe releases my wrists and grabs both my ankles, pushing them back until my knees are by my ears. The position is impossible—I'm completely folded in half, my pussy pointed straight up like an offering to dark gods. He's standing now, using gravity to drive down into me.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\nHis balls swing forward and SMACK into the crease where my ass meets my thighs — so much ass that it cushions the impact, the cheeks spread wide by my position, soft flesh rippling outward in waves from each collision. I can feel my own ass jiggling against the dirt floor, hear the wet slap of sweat-soaked cheek-meat, feel the way gravity pools it around me like warm dough. The sound fills the hut — ball-slap layered over ass-clap layered over the obscene SQUELCH of my pussy being reshaped.\n\n\"This is how we breed difficult ones.\" He's grunting with effort now, sweat dripping from his warty nose onto my stomach.\n\nI look down and see my stomach bulging slightly with each thrust. His cock is so deep it's visible through my skin, a moving lump that appears and disappears. The sight makes something in my brain short-circuit.\n\n\"No no no NO—\"\n\nBut he just grins wider, his yellow eyes gleaming with triumph. He SPITS again, this time directly into my open mouth. I try to spit it back but he covers my mouth with his hand, forcing me to swallow his thick, sour saliva.\n\n\"Get used to gobbo flavors. Gonna be tastin' nothin' but gobbo from now on.\"\n\nHe's fucking me like he's trying to split me in half.\n\nMy vision is going white at the edges. That pressure is at critical mass, about to explode. My legs shake uncontrollably. My pussy spasms around his cock in pre-orgasmic warnings.\n\nHe must feel it because he leans down again, his face inches from mine. I can see every wart, every boil, smell every bit of his rotten breath.\n\n\"Go on then.\" His voice drops to a whisper. \"Cum on the cock of somethin' ye wanted ta kill. Show me what Aldric the Great really is—just another cunt that creams for gobbo dick.\"\n\nThe words hit like physical blows. Every goblin I've killed. Every raid I've stopped. Every woman I've rescued from exactly this fate. And here I am, about to—\n\nHis tongue suddenly drags across my face, from chin to forehead, leaving a trail of thick saliva. The sensation, the degradation, the sheer wrongness of this tiny creature OWNING me—\"I... I won't cum. I WON'T!\"\n\nThe words tear from my throat, raw with fury. I glare up at this diseased creature perched between my spread thighs, his purple-headed breeding pole notched against my entrance like a battering ram at castle gates.\n\n\"HAHA! Still barkin' like ye got teeth!\"\n\nHe SLAMS forward.\n\nThe invasion punches air from my lungs. Every ridge, every wart, every throbbing vein carves through my walls as he hilts himself with one brutal drop of his hips. His hairy sack SMACKS against my ass with enough force to leave marks.\n\n\"There's me favorite sheath!\" He grins down at me, yellow eyes gleaming with malice. \"Feel how yer cunt sucks me in? Like it was molded for gobbo cock!\"\n\nI try to maintain my glare but his weight—Flux's balls, his POT BELLY presses against my mound, grinding with each thrust. His face is level with my tits, these spit-slick mountains that still bear his teeth marks. As he pulls back and RAMS home again, they swing up like wrecking balls.\n\n*WHAP!*\n\nMy own tit slaps me in the face. The impact leaves a wet streak of his saliva across my cheek—onion-rot mixed with the sweet perfume of my own betraying flesh.\n\n\"HAH! Smacked by yer own udder!\" He grabs both tits, using them as handholds while he ruts. \"Milk-handles for proper breedin'!\"\n\nHis rhythm changes—three quick rabbit-thrusts then one DEEP grind that makes me see stars. My legs are splayed wide, heel-boots pointing at the ceiling while this creature that barely reaches my chest cavity raids my insides.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-GRIIIIIND*\n\n\"Feel that?\" He looks up at me from between my tits, his face twisted in a leer that shows every broken tooth. \"That's me cock kissin' yer baby-door. Knockin' to plant green seed in hero-dirt.\"\n\nI try to respond but he suddenly LUNGES forward, his face burying between my breasts while his hips piston. His tongue—rough as tree bark—drags across my cleavage, gathering the pooled sweat there.\n\n\"Tastes like...\" *SLAM* \"...flowers and...\" *SLAM* \"...fear-sweat!\" *SLAM*\n\nEach thrust makes my whole body jolt upward, tits bouncing in different directions—sometimes figure-eights, sometimes opposing circles, sometimes both flying up to frame his leering face. He watches them move with the fascination of a child with a new toy.\n\n\"Gonna make these feed a whole generation,\" he grunts, biting down on my left nipple hard enough to make me cry out. \"Dozen pups hangin' off while I pump another dozen into this greedy goblin-socket!\"\n\nThe angle—Eon help me, the angle. His cock curves up inside me, dragging against something that makes lightning shoot through my spine. My pussy CLENCHES around him involuntarily, trying to milk him like my body knows its purpose better than my mind.\n\n\"There it is!\" He releases my nipple with a wet POP. \"Feel that hungry squeeze? That's yer cunt beggin' for gobbo babies!\"\n\nHe suddenly HAWKS and SPITS — a thick yellow glob that lands on my lower lip and slides into my open mouth, catching on a strand of black hair stuck to my cheek on its way down. The taste — rotted onions mixed with infection — hits my tongue at the same time the hair does, and I gag on both, his phlegm and my own beauty tangled together in my throat.\n\n\"Swallow.\"\n\nI shake my head violently but his cock GRINDS deeper, stirring my insides like a mortar and pestle.\n\n\"Swallow me gift or I visit yer wife tomorrow.\"\n\nI swallow. I don't know why - that threat didn't make ANY sense. But for some reason, for a split-second, I boutght it. The thick phlegm slides down my throat like a slug.\n\n\"Good cow!\" He rewards me by changing his angle, making his cock drag against that spot that—NO. I won't. I WON'T.\n\nBut my body is already responding. That terrible pressure building again, twice as fast as before. My thighs shake. My pussy ripples around him in waves.\n\n\"Look at me.\" His voice drops to something predatory. \"LOOK at who's breedin' ye.\"\n\nI force my eyes open. His face is inches from mine now, having crawled up my body while staying buried inside me. Yellow eyes with pupils like goat slits. Skin like pond scum, glistening with sweat. That broken-glass grin spreading wider as he watches my face contort.\n\n\"This is what's gonna father yer children.\" He emphasizes each word with a thrust. \"This. Ugly. Gobbo. Face.\"\n\nHis tongue suddenly extends—longer than should be possible—and drags from my chin to my forehead in one wet stripe. The smell of his breath—battlefield latrines mixed with rotted meat—fills my nostrils.\n\n\"Yer cock-polishers are perfect,\" he says, grinding in circles. \"These pussy lips? Made to shine gobbo meat. This whole body? Just a fuck-glove for me to wear.\"\n\nHe demonstrates by pulling almost completely out—just the fat purple head spreading my entrance—then SLAMMING home with his full weight.\n\n*SPLORTCH*\n\nThe sound my pussy makes—wet, eager, obscene—echoes in the hut. I'm so wet that each thrust sends little sprays of my shame splashing against his thighs.\n\n\"Listen to that sloppy hero-hole singin'!\" He starts a brutal pace, his balls creating a steady drumbeat against my ass. *PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP* \"Know what that sound is? That's nature sayin' ye belong under goblins!\"\n\nMy vision is going white at the edges. That pressure has become unbearable, a dam about to burst. My pussy is clenching so hard around him I can feel every ridge, every wart, every pulse of his veins.\n\n\"Gonna—gonna cum, ain't ye?\" He grins wider, his hips becoming a blur. \"Can't fight it. Can't fight what ye ARE. Just another breedin'-hole that needed green cock to teach it!\"\n\n\"I—I won't—FUCK—\"\n\nHe suddenly grabs my throat with one hand, my hair with the other, forcing me to maintain eye contact as he RAILS into me. His face is pure animal triumph, tongue lolling out, drooling onto my cheek.\n\n\"Cum for yer master. Show me what Aldric becomes with real cock inside!\"\n\nThe pressure CRESTS—\n\nHe LICKS me. His whole tongue across my face, from jaw to temple, leaving a trail of thick saliva that reeks of decay.",

My guard drops for one heartbeat.\n\nThat's all he needs.\n\nHis cock FLEXES inside me, swelling thicker, and something deep in my guts just... gives up.\n\n\"AAAAAHHHHHNNNNNGGGHHHH!\"\n\nThe sound tears from my throat—not a scream, not a moan, but something animal and broken. My pussy CLAMPS around him like a fist, rippling from entrance to depths in waves that feel like my insides are trying to swallow him whole.\n\n\"THERE IT IS!\" Snib howls, grinding his hips in victory circles. \"HERO-CUNT CUMMIN' ON GOBBO MEAT!\"\n\nMy back arches so hard I lift us both off the ground. My vision goes white-hot-bright as every nerve from scalp to toes fires at once. It's like being struck by lightning from inside—starting in my pussy and EXPLODING outward through my whole body.\n\n*SQUIRRRRRT-SPLURRRT-SQUIRRRRRT*\n\nThe first jet shoots out around his cock, painting a line up my own stomach, between my tits, across my face. Hot and thick like I'm pissing my dignity away. I can SEE it arcing through the air—crystal streams of pure humiliation splashing back down on my bouncing tits.\n\n\"LOOK AT YE PISSIN' YERSELF!\" Snib cackles, SLAMMING deeper. \"SQUIRTIN' LIKE A BROKE FOUNTAIN!\"\n\nMy pussy won't stop clenching, milking, SUCKING at his cock like it's trying to pull him deeper. Each squeeze sends another jet shooting out—*SPLURRRT-GUSH-SPLURRRT*—painting his belly, my thighs, the floor. The metal bikini top CLANGS as my tits bounce so hard they escape the triangles completely, nipples dragging across my own face.\n\n\"GNNNAAAHHHH! HAAAHHHHNNN!\"\n\nThe sounds coming from me aren't human. High-pitched squeals mixed with guttural groans as my body convulses. My heels scrape against the floor, metal SHRIEKING as my legs try to close but can't because he's BURIED between them, his pot belly grinding against my clit with each thrust.\n\n\"Aldric the Great!\" He yanks my hair, forcing me to look at him through my orgasm. \"CUMMIN' ON MY COCK!\"\n\nMy pussy responds with another violent squeeze, another arc of squirt that hits me in the face. I taste myself—salt-sweet defeat on my lips. My ass lifts completely off the floor, SLAPPING back down with a meaty THUD that makes everything jiggle.\n\nThe orgasm won't END. It keeps rolling through me in waves, each one making my pussy grip him tighter. I feel every ridge, every wart, every throbbing vein as my walls memorize his shape. My womb—something deep inside is ACHING, pulsing, trying to open—\n\n[Image: My womb. He's in my womb.\n*POP*\n\n\"AAAIIIIIEEEEEE!\"\n\nA ring of muscle I didn't know I had STRETCHES around his flared cockhead — I feel it opening, resisting, then surrendering with a wet *POP* that I hear through my own bones. He's THROUGH. Past the last gate. The head swells on the other side like a fist clenching inside a glove, and suddenly every sensation triples because the walls in there are paper-thin and screaming with nerves that have never been touched.\n\n\"HAHA! IN YER BABY-ROOM NOW!\" Snib grunts, grinding against walls so sensitive I feel his HEARTBEAT through them.\n\nThe sensation—Flux's balls, it's like he's INSIDE my stomach but lower, deeper. My pussy is still cumming, still squeezing, but now there's this deeper ache, this hollow NEED where his cockhead has lodged somewhere it shouldn't be.\n\n\"Feel that?\" He grins down at me, my squirt still dripping from his chest. \"That's me cock in yer womb. Where Aldric's GOBBO BABIES will grow!\"]I BITE down on his tongue—HARD.\n\nHe doesn't pull back. His yellow goat-eyes GLEAM with triumph as I sink my teeth into the rough muscle. Copper fills my mouth—his blood, green and bitter—but he just grins wider and pushes his tongue DEEPER, licking the inside of my mouth while I bite him.\n\n\"Mmmph—that's it, hero—taste yer master—\"\n\nThe violation of it—his tongue exploring my mouth while I'm trying to hurt him—breaks something. That dam I've been holding back with pure will just... gives.\n\nMy pussy CLAMPS around his cock like a fist. Not the controlled squeeze from before—this is my body SEIZING, every muscle from my toes to my scalp locking up as liquid lightning shoots through my spine.\n\n\"HNNNNGAAAAAAHHHHH!\"\n\nThe sound tears from my throat—not a scream, not a moan, but something animal. My mouth falls open, releasing his bloodied tongue as my eyes roll back. I can feel them rolling, showing whites, my face contorting into that slack-jawed expression I've seen on breeding mares.\n\nMy cunt starts MILKING him—rippling from entrance to deepest point in waves that I can't control. Each squeeze makes wet SQUELCH-SQUELCH sounds as I grip his cock like I'm trying to wring it dry.\n\n\"THERE'S the cum-face!\" Snib crows, grinding deeper. \"Look at them eyes rollin'! Just like a cow gettin' bred!\"\n\nThen I feel it—pressure building in my belly, but wrong, like I need to piss but MORE. Before I can process it—\n\n*SPLOOOOOOORT*\n\nA hot jet of clear fluid ERUPTS from around his cock, arcing up between us. It splashes across my own tits, my face, dripping into my open mouth. I taste myself—salt-sweet shame, woman-brine, the flavor of defeat.\n\n\"Look at that hero-juice fly!\" Snib laughs, continuing to pound.\n\n*SPLURT-SPLURT-SPLURT*\n\nMore jets with each thrust. They spray everywhere—painting his green belly, soaking the dirt floor, making obscene puddles. My pussy won't stop GUSHING, like he's pumping it out of me with his cock. My ass lifts completely off the ground with each orgasmic spasm, then SLAPS back down into the puddle I'm creating.\n\n*THUD-SQUIRT-THUD-SQUIRT*\n\n\"Been holdin' that in all day, eh?\" He grabs my hair at the roots, YANKING my head up to face him. \"All that fight just made more juice to squeeze out!\"\n\nThe orgasm won't stop. It keeps rolling through me in waves, each one making me squirt again. My thighs shake so hard they SLAP together around his hips. My pussy clenches and releases, clenches and releases, like it's trying to suck him deeper—\n\nAnd then—\n\n[Image: My womb. He's in my womb.\n*POP*\n\nSomething gives way inside me. His cock suddenly drops an inch deeper, through some barrier I didn't know existed. The sensation is WRONG—too deep, too invasive, like he's pushed through into my guts.\n\n\"AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!\"\n\nThis scream is different. Higher. Broken. The feeling of him THAT DEEP makes every nerve ending fire at once. My squirting becomes violent—SPLOOOOOSH.\n\n\"Feel that?\" Snib grinds his hips, stirring his cock in this new depth. \"That's me cockhead in yer baby-room! Pushed right through!\"\n\nBaby room? He means—oh Flux, oh no—\n\n\"Womb-deep now!\" He pulls my hair harder, forcing me to look at where we're joined. \"See how yer belly bulges? That's me cock in yer egg-basket!\"\n\nI can SEE it—a slight rise in my lower belly that moves when he does. He's so deep inside me that he's making my skin tent outward. The sight of it—this goblin's cock visibly distorting my body from within—\n\nAnother orgasm crashes through me. This one's different—deeper, starting from where his cockhead presses against what must be the back wall of my womb. It feels like drowning from the inside out.\n\n\"Gonna paint yer eggs green,\" he grunts, his rhythm getting erratic. \"Gonna flood this hero-womb with gobbo cream!\"",

      "text": "[Image: Even goblin precum can get you pregnant.\n\"No! Not inside! Please!\"\n\nThe words tear from my throat but they're pathetic, breathy, the aftershocks of my orgasm still making my pussy ripple around him.\n\n\"Heh... squirted like a broke water barrel.\" His yellow eyes gleam down at me, his weight pressing my tits flat against my ribs. \"Now MY turn to squirt.\"\n\nSomething changes in his face. His broken-glass grin stretches wider, tongue lolling out. A strand of drool lands on my cheek. His breathing gets deeper, rougher. Like a boar about to rut.\n\n\"Ngh—\" A grunt. Low. From his chest.\n\nThen I feel it. His cock—buried so deep in my womb it's making my belly bulge—starts to... flex? No, SWELL. Like it's getting even thicker inside me.\n\n\"HRRNGH!\" Another grunt, louder. His clawed fingers dig into my thighs, spreading them wider. My heel-boots dangle uselessly in the air, metal scraping against nothing.\n\nA pulse. Through his cock. I FEEL it travel from base to tip, a bulge moving through the shaft that's splitting me open. Then—\n\nWarmth.\n\nDeep inside. Deeper than should be possible. A spreading heat in my belly, behind my navel, where his cockhead is lodged in my womb.\n\n\"GAAAHHH—TAKE IT—\" He's squealing now, high-pitched goblin pleasure. \"TAKE ME FIRST BATCH!\"\n\nAnother pulse. Stronger. The warmth becomes a flood. Something thick, viscous, is being pumped directly into—oh Flux. Oh no. He's—\n\nI hear the sound of something thick forcing its way into me. Feel it spreading, filling space that shouldn't exist. My lower belly starts to feel... tight? Full?\n\n\"Look down, cow!\" He grabs my hair, forces my head up. \"Watch yer belly grow!\"\n\nI can see it. Where his cock enters me, my lower stomach is starting to... round. Just slightly. A small dome forming as he pumps—\n\n*SPLURRRRRT*\n\n\"SQUEEEEE!\" His pleasure-squeal is inhuman. \"Breeding the hero! BREEDING ALDRIC'S CUNT!\"\n\nThe stuff inside me—it's HOT. Hotter than blood. And thick, so thick I can feel its weight settling in my womb like molten lead. With each pulse of his cock, more floods in.\n\n\"Can't—\" I try to close my legs but physically CAN'T. The pressure in my womb, the way it's expanding, has spread my hips from the inside. \"Too full—\"\n\n\"Never too full for gobbo cream!\" He grinds deeper, stirring the mess inside me. \"Gonna pack ye tight as a festival sausage!\"\n\nThe smell hits me as the first overflow happens. His cum—because that's what this is, goblin cum pumping directly into my womb—has a reek like spoiled milk mixed with the tannery vats. It's backing up, having nowhere else to go, starting to leak out around his cock.\n\nA wet explosion as pressure gives. Suddenly thick, chunky fluid is spurting out around where we're joined, painting my inner thighs with heat. It's not liquid—it's more like... porridge? Custard? But CHUNKY, with clots that stick to my skin.\n\n\"Seven...\" He's counting. Counting his spurts. \"Eight... NINE...\"\n\nEach number comes with another injection. I can feel individual ropes of it traveling through his cock, bulging the shaft, before splashing into my already-stuffed womb. My belly is visibly distended now, a small pregnancy already.\n\n\"Please—\" I don't know what I'm begging for. It's too late. I'm being bred.\n\n\"Ten... eleven... TWELVE! GRAAAHHH!\"\n\nHe collapses on top of me, his full weight pressing down, his warty cheek nestled between my tits. My hair is everywhere — fanned across the dirt like a black funeral shroud, tangled around his clawed fingers, stuck to my sweaty breasts in wet strands that cross my nipples like dark ribbons. His cock still pulses inside me, each twitch depositing more heat into my stuffed womb. The weight of what he's pumped into me settles like hot gravy in my guts, and when I breathe, I feel it SLOSH.\n\nThen he pulls out.\n\nThe sound is obscene. His cock emerges glazed with white-yellow sludge, strings of it connecting us that stretch three feet before snapping. The moment he's out, my pussy—that violated, gaped hole—starts vomiting his load.\n\nChunky waves of goblin cum pour from me, but my womb stays full. Sealed somehow. The overflow runs down my ass crack, pools under me, glues my cheeks to the floor with sticky heat. The smell is overwhelming—like cheese left in summer sun mixed with something chemical, something bleachy.\n\n\"One more for good luck!\"\n\nHe's still cumming. His cock, free in the air, flexes one final time—\n\nA rope as thick as my thumb arcs through the air, spiraling across both my tits before overshooting, splattering the floor behind my head. It lands with enough force to make a sound—SPLAT—steaming in the cool air.\n\nI try to close my legs. My knees come together but my thighs WON'T — there's a ball of heat in my pelvis forcing them apart from inside, like someone wedged a melon between my hip bones. The cum has WEIGHT. It shifts when I move, sloshing audibly, pressing outward against muscles that have never held anything before. My pussy keeps trying to seal itself shut but it can't — too stretched, too used — and each weak clench pushes out another chunky glob that goes *PLOP* onto the puddle between my thighs.\n\n\"There we go.\" He wipes his cock on my face, the head leaving a snail-trail of cum from jaw to forehead. \"Properly bred. Gobbo-owned inside and out.\"\n\nThe stories. Oh Eon, the stories about women taken by goblin raiders. Always pregnant. ALWAYS. Their seed is too strong, too virile. One load is enough for triplets.\n\nAnd I just took... how much? It feels like a full ale-skin sloshing in my womb.\n\n\"Know what the best part is?\" He stands over me, his cock finally softening but still dripping. \"Usually I take a nice victory piss on a freshly-bred cunt. Mark me territory proper.\"\n\nI tense.\n\n\"But ye lasted so long...\" He scratches his balls thoughtfully. \"Maybe ye really were a hero once. So I'll piss in the bucket instead.\"\n\nHe waddles to the corner, and I hear the splash of him relieving himself, the satisfied grunt as he \"clears the tube\" after breeding.\n\nSomething shifts inside me.\n\nNot the cum settling — something else. A warmth that's different from the heat of his seed. Deeper. More focused. Like a match being struck in a dark room, a single point of fire behind my navel that wasn't there a moment ago.\n\nMy hand goes to my belly without permission. Under the cum-slick skin, under the slight swell of his deposit, something is already HAPPENING. I can feel it the way you feel a storm coming — pressure change, electrical charge, the certainty that what comes next cannot be stopped.\n\nI'm pregnant.\n\nNot maybe. Not probably. My womb knows. This body built for breeding has caught on the first try, and the spark of new life — green, wrong, HIS — is already dividing in my depths.\n\nMy life as Aldric is over.]I try to speak—to curse him, to beg, to say SOMETHING—but with his cock pushed through into my womb, my mouth won't work right.\n\n\"Nnnngh—gahhhh—hahhhn—\"\n\nThe sounds pour out of me, wet and broken. Not words. Just noise. Animal noise.\n\n\"Listen to that!\" Snib grins down at me, his yellow eyes gleaming. \"The great hero's forgot how to talk! Just moanin' like a proper breeding-sow now!\"\n\nHis weight settles on me, pot belly pressing my mound, pinning me completely. I can see his face above mine—green, warty, gleaming with sweat that drips onto my cheeks. His cock flexes inside my womb and I feel it EVERYWHERE—a pulse that runs from my cervix to my teeth.\n\n\"My turn to squirt,\" he says lazily, like we're having a conversation. \"Gonna be a big one. Been savin' up all day watchin' them tits bounce.\"\n\nI feel it before I understand it—his balls lifting off the floor where they'd been resting against my ass. They pull up tight against his body with a wet *schlup* sound, the wrinkled skin drawing taut. His breathing changes, becomes deeper, more guttural.\n\n\"Here it comes, cow...\"\n\nThe first pulse.\n\nHis cock swells inside me—I feel it expand in my womb like a fist opening. Then—\n\nWarmth.\n\nJust warmth at first, spreading somewhere behind my belly button. Not painful, just... wrong. Like soup being poured into a place food should never go.\n\n\"Hnnngh—YEAH—\"\n\nHis voice cracks with pleasure. His hips grind against mine, stirring his cock in that too-deep place. I feel the second pulse—stronger. More warmth, but now with weight to it. Something thick and heavy pooling in my core.\n\n\"Breeding ye proper—FUCK—filling that hero-womb with gobbo-batter—\"\n\nMy mouth falls open. \"Gah—gahhh—nnnnooo—\"\n\nStill can't make words. My brain knows I'm being inseminated but my mouth just makes these pathetic mewling sounds. My legs dangle uselessly in the air, the metal boots clanking softly as they sway.\n\nThird pulse. Fourth. Fifth.\n\nNow I understand what's happening. He's not cumming like a man would—quick spurts and done. This is like... like he's slowly pissing inside me, but thicker. Each pulse is a lazy, heavy rope of something that feels like warm porridge being squeezed from a bag.\n\n\"Feel that?\" He's panting now, drooling onto my face. \"That's me seed plantin' in yer egg-garden. Gonna grow a whole litter of—HNNGH—green babies in this belly—\"\n\nI can feel it now—not just warmth but texture. Lumpy. Stringy. Like someone mixed cottage cheese with tree sap and heated it to fever-temperature. It's filling spaces I didn't know existed, backing up from my womb into places that burn.\n\n\"So much—\" He's gasping, his whole body shaking. \"Been backed up for—FUCK—gonna give ye twins at least—maybe triplets—\"\n\nMy belly—I can SEE my belly starting to round. Just slightly, a soft curve where flat muscle used to be. He's pumping so much inside that I'm swelling with it.\n\n\"Nnnghh—stuh—stop—\"\n\n\"Can't stop now!\" He laughs, grinding deeper. \"Balls ain't empty yet! Still got—HNNGH—still got more—\"\n\nThe tenth pulse. Fifteenth. I've lost count. Each one sends more of that vile warmth spreading through my core. It's so thick I can feel individual clumps sliding through my cervix, each one making my womb stretch a little more.\n\nThen—overflow.\n\nIt has nowhere else to go. I feel it backing up, squirting out around his cock with wet SPLORCH sounds. Hot goblin seed running out of my pussy, down the crack of my ass, pooling under me in a spreading puddle.\n\n\"Too much for ye?\" He grins, still pulsing. \"Little human womb can't hold all of Snib's nut? SHAMEFUL!\"\n\nThe smell hits me—like rotted fish mixed with the bleach they use to clean temple floors, underlaid with something fungal, alive. My eyes water. My stomach turns. But my pussy—that traitor hole—clenches around him, milking out more.\n\n\"Look at that—\" He grabs my hair, forces me to look down at where we're joined. \"See yer belly? That's ME in there. My babies growin' already.\"\n\nI can see it—the slight bulge, the way my skin moves when he shifts. But worse, I can see the cum. Thick yellowish-white sludge oozing out around his still-buried cock, so viscous it stretches in ropes before breaking. Some of it has chunks—actual CHUNKS—like curdled milk.\n\n\"And NOW—\"\n\nHe suddenly pulls out with a wet SCHLOOOORP. My cervix tries to close but it's too slow. I feel—and SEE—a huge glob of cum bubble out of my pussy and splatter onto the floor.\n\n\"The finish!\"\n\nHis cock, still spurting, swings up. A massive rope of cum—thick as my finger—arcs through the air and SPLATS across both my tits. Then another, painting a line from my neck to my navel. The last few spurts are even thicker, landing on my face with weight like someone dropped warm pudding on me.\n\nI lie there, legs still spread, unable to close them. There's so much cum packed in my womb that my legs physically can't come together—like there's a ball of heated jelly in my core forcing them apart.\n\n\"Hehehehe...\" He's standing over me now, his cock finally softening, dripping the last drops onto my belly. \"Look at ye. Bred proper. Can see me seed through yer skin almost.\"\n\nIn the dim light, I can see my lower belly trembling. It moves when I breathe, sloshing.\n\n\"Know what's happenin' right now?\" He squats next to me, poking my cum-swollen belly. \"Million little swimmers racin' for yer eggs. Probably already found 'em. Yer gonna be a mother, hero. A mother to GOBLINS.\"\n\nThe horror of it crashes over me. The stories. The warnings. No woman filled with this much goblin seed has ever NOT gotten pregnant. Usually with multiples. My womb is literally STUFFED with hypervirile monster cum.\n\n\"Ye know...\" He stands, walks to the corner. I hear him pissing into a bucket, the stream heavy and satisfied. \"Usually I take a nice victory piss on a freshly bred bitch. Mark me territory proper. But ye lasted so long...\" He looks back at me over his shoulder. \"Maybe ye really were a hero once. So I'll give ye that—no piss. Just cum.\"\n\nHe shakes off the last drops, his cock making wet slapping sounds against his thigh.\n\n\"Welcome to yer new life, Elise. Gobbo breeding-stock.\"\n\nI try to close my legs again. Can't. The cum inside has formed a solid mass, pressing outward. I'm going to be pregnant. I know it with horrible certainty.\n\nAldric the Great is going to birth goblins.]My hands fly to his chest, trying to push him back, but the moment I strain against him—\n\n\"AAAHHH!\"\n\nPain shoots through my core. His cockhead—it's STUCK. Lodged deep in that forbidden space, swollen like a fist that won't release. When I try to push him away, it PULLS at something inside that makes white spots dance across my vision.\n\n\"HAHA! Stupid cow!\" He grins down at me, yellow eyes gleaming. \"Don't ye know? When gobbo cock goes womb-deep, it LOCKS! Like dogs knottin'! Try to pull me out now and ye'll rip yer baby-bag right out with it!\"\n\nTerror floods through me. I'm TRAPPED. Pinned beneath this diseased creature with his breeding pole locked inside my deepest parts. My heels scrape uselessly against the floor—*SCREEE-CLACK-SCREEE*—trying to find purchase to escape, but every movement just makes his cock shift inside my womb, sending wrong-wrong-WRONG sensations through my guts.\n\n\"Now it's MY turn to squirt,\" he grunts, his face twisting with pleasure. \"Gonna fill this hero-hole with gobbo-goop. Gonna drown them eggs in green baby-batter!\"\n\nI feel it before I understand it—his balls drawing up tight against my ass, lifting slightly off the floor as they contract. The shaft inside me starts to pulse, actually PULSE, like a second heartbeat buried in my guts.\n\n\"Here it comes—HNNNGH!\"\n\nHis first grunt is guttural, animal. His whole body goes rigid on top of me, pot belly pressing down on my mound, his weight pinning me completely. Then I feel—\n\nWarmth.\n\nDeep inside. Deeper than anything should be. A spreading heat in that violated space behind my belly button. Not much at first, just... warmth.\n\n\"GRAHHHH! Take it! TAKE ME SEED!\"\n\nThe second pulse is stronger. I can actually FEEL the cum traveling up his shaft—a bulge that moves through my stretched pussy walls before—\n\nIt erupts inside my womb. Not a spray but a GUSH. Thick, viscous, HOT. Hotter than blood. It coats my insides with slime that immediately starts to congeal, like porridge cooling in a pot.\n\n\"Feel that?\" He's panting, drooling on my face. \"That's gobbo-cream! Thick as butter! Swimmin' with babies!\"\n\nAnother pulse. This one I can SEE—his cock visibly throbs where it enters me, the veins bulging. The warmth spreads, fills, begins to create pressure. My womb is small—never meant for this—and already it feels FULL.\n\n\"Listen to it!\" He squeals with glee. \"Hear me balls emptyin'? That's the sound of yer future! Green babies! Dozens of 'em!\"\n\nThe pressure builds. I can feel my womb stretching, accommodating. There's nowhere for it to go—his cockhead is corked inside like a bottle stopper, keeping every drop trapped. The fullness becomes pain becomes something else—a horrible awareness of being STUFFED.\n\n\"STOP! It's too much—I can't—\"\n\n\"Can't what? Can't hold all me nut?\" He grinds his hips, stirring the cum inside me. \"Yer womb's gonna learn. Gonna stretch nice and wide for gobbo-loads!\"\n\nI look down. There's a dome forming in my lower belly — small but VISIBLE, and I can feel it from inside like a water balloon being filled in my guts. The skin is taut over it, shiny with sweat, and when he pumps another rope in I watch it GROW. My womb stretches to hold what it's being given, and the stretch sends this deep, dull ache through my pelvis — like period cramps described to me by my wife. Now I understand. Now I'm living it, watching my own belly swell with monster seed.\n\nThe sounds are obscene. Wet. Chunky. Like someone pouring thick stew into a too-small pot. I can feel individual CLOTS of thicker cum pushing through his cockhead, plopping into my womb like pearls of congealed cream.\n\n\"Packed tight as a sausage!\" He crows, watching my belly. \"Look at that little bump! That's me batter! That's gobbo-juice makin' ye a mommy!\"\n\nThe smell hits me as some begins to leak around his shaft—bleach mixed with rotted fish mixed with something fungal, something ALIVE. It's so strong my eyes water. The heat of it burns without burning, like holding snow too long.\n\nHis claws dig into my thighs, spreading them wider as he GRUNTS again. Another massive pulse. This one forces cum to leak around his shaft—not much, just droplets, but I feel them running down the crack of my ass, thick and stringy like molten cheese.\n\n\"Can't even close yer legs now!\" He laughs, and he's RIGHT. The fullness in my womb makes my thighs naturally splay outward. If I try to bring them together, it presses on that cum-bloated organ and sends wrong signals through my body. \"Gonna waddle bow-legged from now on! Full of gobbo-spunk!\"\n\nMy pussy makes horrible sounds around his cock—SQUELCH-GLORP-SPLUTTER—as it tries to accommodate both his girth and the backup of cum. Some spurts out with each pulse, painting my inner thighs with ropes of off-white sludge that immediately starts to cool and congeal.\n\n\"All those years killin' goblins,\" he grunts, still cumming, still filling. \"Now yer gonna BIRTH 'em! Ain't that perfect? Hero becomes brood-sow!\"\n\nI try to respond but another pulse—the biggest yet—makes me arch off the ground. It's like someone injecting porridge directly into my organs. The pressure is immense. My lower belly visibly shifts as the cum finds every space, fills every fold of my womb.\n\n\"Almost done,\" he pants, his whole body shaking. \"Just... HNNGH... few more... SPURTS!\"\n\nThe final ejaculations are different—thicker, chunkier. I can feel solid CLOTS pushing through, like cottage cheese forced through a tube. They plop into my already-full womb with sounds I can somehow HEAR from inside—PLOP-PLOP-GLOP.\n\nThen, finally, he stops.\n\nWe lay there panting. Him on top of me, still locked inside. Me spread beneath him, womb stuffed with what feels like a gallon of goblin cum. I can feel it MOVING inside me—not flowing, but writhing. Like it's alive. Like it's seeking.\n\n\"Feel 'em swimmin'?\" He grins down at me. \"Gobbo-sperm don't just swim—they HUNT. Right now they're racin' for yer eggs. Fightin' each other to knock ye up proper.\"\n\nHe starts to pull out. The sensation is horrifying—his cockhead deflating, changing shape as it releases its lock on my womb. There's a wet SHHHHHLORP as the seal breaks, and suddenly—\n\nCum GUSHES from my pussy. Not all of it—most stays trapped deep inside—but enough pours out to make obscene puddles between my legs. It's thick, ropey, CHUNKY with those cottage cheese clots. The smell intensifies—concentrated bleach-rot that makes me gag.\n\n\"Perfect cream-pie,\" Snib observes, standing over me. My legs are still splayed, unable to close. Cum continues to leak in thick globs—PLOP... PLOP... PLOP. \"Usually I take a nice victory piss on a freshly bred bitch, but...\" He scratches his balls thoughtfully. \"Ye lasted longer than most. Maybe ye really were a hero once.\"\n\nHe waddles to a bucket in the corner, his cock still dripping. The sound of his piss hitting tin echoes through the hut—SPLASSSSSSHHHHH—as he sighs with satisfaction.\n\n\"Ahhh, always gotta clear the tube after a good breeding!\"\n\nI lay there, defeated. Cum cooling on my thighs, in my ass crack, pooling beneath me. But worse is what's still inside—that hot, writhing mass of goblin seed that even now is seeking, hunting, CLAIMING.\n\nI know the stories. Every woman taken by goblins. Always pregnant. Always.\n\nThere's no way I'm not carrying his spawn now.\n\nThe thought makes me want to scream, but all that comes out is a broken whimper as more cum GLOPS from my destroyed pussy.\n\n[Image: I know the stories.

These soft, small hands that once wielded Whisperwind gutted fish and fed them to this creature. He ate with his mouth open, belching, grease running down his chin, while I sat in the corner trying not to gag from the stench of his home—old cum, rotting meat, and something fungal growing in the corners.\n\nNow he's sprawled on his pile of furs, patting his distended belly. The loincloth barely contains what's beneath, the outline obscene in the flickering firelight.\n\n\"Time for dessert,\" he says, then laughs at his own wit. \"Strip. Want somethin' nice to look at while ye work.\"\n\n\"I don't—we agreed just—\"\n\n\"Just suckin', yeah. But I want them udders free.

The weight makes me gasp—without even that pathetic support, they hang so heavy my shoulders immediately ache. In the firelight, the red marks from the metal are visible—angry crescents bitten into flesh that's pale as fresh cream. My nipples, freed from their prison, are already puckering in the cool air.\n\n\"Look at them things,\" Snib breathes.\n\nI cover myself instinctively but he tsks.\n\n\"Hands down. Let 'em swing.\"\n\nMy arms drop. The tits follow gravity, hanging like overripe fruit. I can feel his yellow eyes tracking every sway.\n\n\"Now the bottom.\"\n\nThe thong peels away from my hips with a wet sound that makes me want to die. Strings of... of moisture... stretch and snap. The air hits my pussy and I feel it contract, that hollow ache suddenly acute. I'm bare. Completely naked before this thing that should be crushed under my boot.\n\n[Image: The air hits my pussy and I feel it contract, that hollow ache suddenly acute.\n\n\"On yer knees, Lady Udders.\"\n\nThe nickname hits like a slap. But I drop. The packed dirt floor is hard under my knees. From here, his cock is eye level where it tents his loincloth. The smell—Eon preserve me, the smell.\n\nHe shifts, spreading his legs wider. The loincloth falls aside.\n\nIt's... not all purple like I'd glimpsed before. The shaft is green—darker than his skin, mottled with veins thick as quill-stems that pulse visibly with his heartbeat. But the head... the head is purple-black like a bruise, swollen huge, the hole at the tip already weeping thick white tears that gather but don't fall, building into a growing pearl of concentrated filth.\n\n\"Never seen one up close?\" He grips the base, making it bob.\n\nIt's the size of my forearm—my old forearm. The foreskin is partially pulled back, revealing the ridge where green meets purple, crusty with... with... I don't want to know. White-yellow buildup that reeks even from here.\n\n\"Come closer, Throatsy.\"\n\nAnother name. I shuffle forward on my knees and my tits swing with the motion, slapping together softly. From barely a foot away, the heat radiating from his cock is palpable. Like it has its own climate. The precum pearl finally breaks its own surface tension and begins a slow slide down the purple head, leaving a snail-trail that glistens.\n\n\"Open.\"\n\nOne word. My mouth... my mouth opens. Like it was waiting for permission. The fog in my head thickens.\n\n\"Good cow. Now stick out yer tongue.\"\n\nMy tongue extends. Pink, soft, trembling. He laughs and guides his cock forward with one hand, the other tangling in my hair.\n\nThe first contact—\n\n[Image: Bitter. Salt. Rot. Cheese. Metal. All at once, coating my tongue with oil-thick fluid that burns like acid.\n\n\"That's it,\" he grunts. \"Taste it first. Let yer mouth learn what it's for.\"\n\nThe precum floods my tongue immediately. Not drips—a steady weeping like the cock is crying onto my tastebuds. Each pulse of his heartbeat produces more. It's thick as porridge but somehow also liquid, running down my tongue toward my throat despite my efforts to keep it pooled at the front.\n\n\"Now the head. Lips around it. Like kissin' a baby.\"\n\nI want to pull back. Want to run. But the collar is there, always there, and beyond that... beyond that my thoughts keep scattering. What was I angry about? The taste is so strong it whites out everything else. My lips part wider and then—\n\nThe head pushes past them. Purple-black cock-head the size of a small apple spreading my lips obscenely wide. The ridge catches on them, too thick, and he has to push harder. Something tears—not badly, just a little split in my lower lip that immediately stings from his precum.\n\n\"There we go! Look at them hero-lips stretched around gobbo cock!\"\n\nTears stream from my eyes immediately. Not from emotion—from the sheer effort of accommodating something this thick. My jaw aches already. But worse is the flood. The second the head passes my lips, it's like a dam breaks. Precum doesn't drip or leak—it SPURTS. Rope after rope coats my mouth, pooling under my tongue, filling my cheeks.\n\nI try not to swallow. Try to breathe through my nose but that's worse—the concentrated stench makes my head spin, makes my pussy... no, ignore that, ignore the clenching, ignore the wetness running down my thighs.\n\n\"Use yer tongue, Sucky-tits. Polish the head.\"\n\nMy tongue moves. I don't tell it to, it just... does. Swirling around the massive head, finding the hole that keeps pumping fluid. The taste changes—still vile but now with undertones. Something yeasty. Something alive. My throat makes a sound—not quite a gag, not quite a moan.\n\n\"That's it,\" he grunts, gripping my hair tighter. \"Now take more.\"\n\nHe pulls my head forward. Another inch of green shaft disappears. The veins drag against my lips, each ridge distinct. Two inches. Three. The head hits the back of my mouth and my throat closes instinctively.\n\n\"Swallow,\" he commands. \"Open that hero-throat.\"\n\nI try to pull back but his grip is iron. My tits hang below me, swaying with my struggles, nipples dragging in the dirt. Four inches. Five. The head presses against my throat entrance and then—\n\nI swallow. Not voluntarily. My throat just... opens. Accepts. The head pushes through and suddenly I can't breathe at all. Six inches. Seven. My nose is getting closer to his pelvis where the smell is concentrated hell.\n\n\"Look up at me. Want to see them pretty eyes.\"\n\n[Image: gif]\nI look up. Past the expanse of green cock disappearing into my face. Past his pot belly. To those yellow eyes bright with malicious joy.\n\n\"There she is,\" he coos. \"Aldric the Great with eight inches of gobbo cock down her throat. How's it feel, hero?\"\n\nI can't answer. Can't breathe. Can only make wet sounds as my throat tries to accommodate something never meant to fit. Precum pours directly into my stomach now, hot and thick, and I can feel it... doing something.\n\n\"Let's make it nine.\"\n\nHe pulls my head forward again. My lips touch his pelvis. Wiry pubic hair scratches my nose. The smell—concentrated piss and fungus and male—floods my brain. Nine inches. Ten. How is this possible? My throat is bulging visibly. I can feel the outline through my neck when my hand goes there instinctively.\n\n\"All the way, Gullet-slut. Show me what them hero-throats can do.\"\n\nThe last two inches are impossible. But he pulls harder and my throat... stretches? Opens? I feel the head push past my collarbone, into my chest. Twelve inches of goblin cock buried in my face. My lips pressed against his pelvis. His massive balls resting on my chin, hot and heavy and churning with horrible life.\n\n\"Now the milkin' motion,\" he instructs. \"Squeeze with yer throat. Like swallowin' over and over.\"\n\nMy throat convulses around him. Each swallow makes him grunt, makes more precum flood directly into my stomach. I'm drowning. Suffocating. But also... also the fog in my head is getting thicker. Warmer. Almost pleasant. What was I upset about? Something about... about...\n\n\"Twenty swallows,\" he grunts. \"Count 'em.\"\n\nOne. My throat squeezes. He groans.\nTwo. More precum floods me.\nThree. My pussy clenches in rhythm.\nFour. Tears and snot run down my face.\nFive. His balls tighten against my chin.\n\nBy ten, black spots dance in my vision. By fifteen, I'm making sounds—wet, desperate, animal sounds around his cock. By twenty, I'm barely conscious.\n\nHe pulls out slow. Each inch reveals itself wet with throat-slime and precum. The head pops free from my lips with an obscene SLURP and I gasp, air flooding my burning lungs. Ropes of throat-slime mixed with precum connect my lips to his cock, refusing to break even when I pull back.\n\n\"Good start,\" he says, guiding my head back down. \"Now the proper suckin'.\"\n\nThis time I know what's coming but it doesn't help. The head pushes past my lips easier—they're already swollen, already shaped to him. The rhythm establishes itself. Down to take eight inches, up to breathe, down to take ten, up to gasp. My tits swing beneath me with each motion, slapping together wetly.\n\n\"Look at them udders dance,\" he laughs. \"Swingin' while ye suck. This is what ye were made for, Throatsy. Not swords. Just succin' gobbo cock while them tits bounce.\"\n\nThe humiliation should burn but something is making everything fuzzy. Distant. Like I'm watching someone else debase themselves. Some other woman with massive tits slobbering on goblin cock while tears stream down her face.\n\nHis breathing gets heavier. The cock swells impossibly larger in my mouth. His balls draw up tight against my chin.\n\n[Image: The cock pulses. Swells. The head flares wider and then—\n\n\"Here it comes,\" he grunts. \"Yer first taste of gobbo cream. Remember, cow—ye can spit it all out after. That was the deal.\"\n\nThe cock pulses. Swells. The head flares wider and then—\n\n*Wait!*\n\n[Choice: Pull back!",

The head flares wider in my mouth—I can feel the pisshole dilating, opening like a tiny mouth about to scream.\n\nI jerk back in panic but I'm not fast enough.\n\nThe first rope.\n\nIt starts in my mouth—hot as boiled porridge, thick as cake batter—then follows my retreat, extending from his cock like some horrible umbilical. The rope doesn't break, just keeps coming, pumping from that purple head in one continuous stream that drapes across my face as I fall backward. Heavy. So fucking heavy it actually PULLS as it lands, like someone poured hot pudding across my features.\n\n\"GRAAAHHHHH! YELLAH-YELLAH-YELLAH!\"\n\n[Image: It starts in my mouth—hot as boiled porridge, thick as cake batter...\nHe's screaming in Goblish, hips bucking off the furs. His balls—I can see them contracting, pumping, churning out their poison. The second rope comes while the first is still connected—this one catches me across both eyes, sealing them shut with weight and heat that burns like acid but doesn't damage, just... marks. Claims.\n\n\"HERO-CUNT PAINTED! PAINTED PROPER!\"\n\nIt lands across my tits with an audible SPLAT—not liquid, almost solid, maintaining its rope-shape even as it drapes over my nipples. The weight of it makes my tits drop another inch. The smell—rotted fish guts mixed with cheese left in summer sun mixed with that chemical burn of concentrated masculinity—floods every sense.\n\n\"Look at ye! LOOK AT YE! Aldric the Great with gobbo-glaze! HAH! HAH! HAH!\"\n\nMore ropes. They come lazy but heavy, each one a full second of continuous flow from that purple nightmare. Four across my nose and mouth—I can't breathe without tasting it. Five pools in the hollow of my throat. Six and seven create a crosshatch pattern across my tits, the weight making them pull and ache.\n\nHis cock never stops moving, conducting his orgasm like a maestro's baton. Painting deliberate stripes across his masterpiece. My hair gets a full rope that immediately makes it stick to my skull. My belly receives two more that pool in my navel like a warm, cursed lake.\n\n\"Grashk-na-THRAKKKK!\"\n\nPure Goblish now, no more Common tongue. Just chittering, grunting, squealing triumph as rope after rope of custard-thick seed decorates the fallen hero. Some shots have chunks in them—actual clotted pieces that land with heavier splats. Others are pure cream, yellow-white and reeking of concentrated corruption.\n\nEleven. Twelve. Thirteen.\n\nI lose count. My eyes are sealed shut by the sheer weight of it. When I try to breathe through my mouth, ropes slide in—salt and battery acid and yeast and something else, something that makes my brain feel like it's dissolving. Not thoughts but the STRUCTURE of thoughts, the architecture that holds Aldric together.\n\nThe final rope—it has to be the twentieth at least—drops directly between my spread knees. A pool of it, steaming in the dirt, enough to fill a tankard. My pussy is RIGHT THERE, inches away, and I feel the heat radiating up, making that traitor hole clench and drool its own shame onto the puddle.\n\nThen silence except for his panting.\n\n\"Open them eyes, cow.\"\n\nI try. The cum has formed a seal, gumming my lashes together. I have to use my fingers to peel them apart, and when I do—\n\nHe's grinning down at me. His cock still hard, still drooling, a final strand connecting the tip to the pool between my legs.\n\n\"That's what defeat looks like,\" he says simply. \"That's Aldric the Great, ended. Just a cum-glazed cunt now.\"\n\nI stumble to my feet. Everything slides but doesn't fall—his seed is too thick, adhering like warm glue. My tits wear it like a necklace of pearls. My face feels like a mask of shame. When I try to speak, to curse him, a rope slides into my mouth and I taste concentrated goblin essence.\n\nOutside. The well I saw. I need water.\n\n[Choice: Stumble outside.",

My spike-heels immediately sink into sand—*shhhk-shhhk*—and I pitch forward, massive tits swinging like temple bells coated in... in...\n\nGoblin seed. Still warm. Still MOVING.\n\nI can feel it. Feel THEM. Millions of tiny swimmers still alive in the custard-thick glaze, trying to find something to fertilize. They're in my HAIR, making it stick to my skull in cum-mortared clumps. In my EYELASHES, gumming them together so I have to claw them open. A particularly heavy rope slides from my collarbone down between my tits with a sound like *shlooooorp*, pooling in my navel before overflowing down toward my—\n\nNO. No no no no—\n\nMy pussy. My treacherous cunt clenches as the warm river approaches, and I SLAP my hand over it, but that just smears more of HIS ESSENCE into my palm. The smell—rotted cheese mixed with battlefield latrines mixed with something FUNGAL, something that makes my vision shimmer—it's not just on me, it's IN me. In my nostrils where I inhaled his precum yesterday by accident. In my throat where he just... where I just...\n\n\"There's a nice stack of straw waitin' for ye when ye come back!\" Snib calls out, chortling behind me as I stumble toward the old well.\n\nMy swollen lips—Eon's BONES my lips feel like overripe fruit, bruised and thick from stretching around that purple... that green... that THING—try to form words but all that comes out is:\n\n\"Gllllkk... hhhhkk...\"\n\nThere's still cum in my throat. I feel it. Thick pearls of it lodged behind my tonsils like oysters. When I cough, trying to expel it, a rope shoots from my mouth and splats onto my right tit, adding to the crosshatch pattern already painted there.\n\nThe well. That ancient K'Tarran well I saw earlier, its runes glowing faint blue in moonlight. Just twenty feet but might as well be twenty leagues.\n\nFirst step: spike-heel SINKS into sand, ankle rolling. The motion makes everything on my body SHIFT—cum sliding, relocating, finding new valleys to pool in. Some runs down my inner thigh and INTO my boot. I feel it squelch between my toes, warm and viscous.\n\nSecond step: I'm crying. Not pretty tears but the ugly kind that come with snot, and the snot mixes with the cum on my upper lip creating this unholy mixture that tastes like—\n\n*Aldric would never—I'M Aldric—No, Elise—No, I'm—Who? WHO AM I?*\n\nThird step: I trip. Fall forward. Catch myself on hands and knees in the sand, tits swinging down to SLAP the ground, cum splattering in droplets that catch moonlight like diseased stars. From behind I must look like... like what I am. A whore. A cock-socket. A throat-pussy that just serviced her master and—\n\n\"FUCK!\" The scream tears out, sending another glob of throat-cum onto the sand. \"Flux dance on your corpse! Eon forget your fucking—Verge close all your—\"\n\nThere's a fog invading my mind. I can't think. Can't make the words line up. The taste... Ephemerals preserve me, the TASTE. Like someone boiled piss and added fish guts for texture. But under that, something worse—that CHEMICAL taste, that MALE taste that speaks directly to the womb I shouldn't have. Each breath through my nose brings more of his musk, and each breath through my mouth brings the flavor of what I just... what just happened in my... with my mouth... my hero's mouth that used to speak battle cries now knows the exact texture of goblin cock-veins.\n\n*Elara had red hair. No. Blonde? She had... she smelled like... like cum. NO. Bread. She smelled like bread. We were trying for... for goblin babies. NO. HUMAN. HUMAN BABIES.*\n\n[Minigame]",

Everything is just... heavy. Wet. Dripping.\n\nI manage three more crawl-steps before my left arm gives out.\n\nThe collapse happens in slow motion. My shoulder hits sand first, then my hip, and then—FLUX'S BURNING BALLS—my tits. The left one SLAMS into the sand, compressing like a wineskin, then the right one FLOPS over it with a meaty WHAP, the weight making me gasp. They're stacked now, the bottom one going numb from pressure while the top one slides off, dragging through sand that sticks to the cum-glaze.\n\nThe world is spinning. No—my HEAD is spinning. Like I'm drunk but wrong, drunk on something that crawls through my sinuses and nests behind my eyes. Every breath brings more of his stench and every breath makes my thoughts more... more what? Sticky. Like the cum cooling on my skin, my thoughts are getting sticky, pulling apart in strings when I try to connect them.\n\n*Elara has... had... will have... brown hair? Red? The color of... of goblin cock? No. NO.*\n\nI try to roll onto my back but just succeed in smearing more of his essence into the sand.

Like... like something my body is starting to recognize.\n\n\"Eon...\" The prayer comes out slurred, drunk. \"Eon re-remembers... remembers what?

I have to put my whole weight on it, which makes my tits swing forward and a fresh rope of cooling goblin seed slides from my hair onto my face like the world's most degrading kiss.\n\n*CREAK-SQUEAL*\n\nSecond pump. Water doesn't come yet. Just that metal-on-metal shriek while I sob harder, naked except for these fucking spike-heeled boots full of his cum squelching between my toes with each shift of weight.\n\n\"Please—\" I'm begging the well now, this ancient K'Tarran thing. \"Please just—just give me—\"\n\n*CREAK-SQUEAL-SPLASH*\n\nWater. Ice cold from deep underground. I cup it to my face but the cum—it doesn't WANT to leave. It's oil-thick, hydrophobic, beading up and rolling around like mercury made of shame. I scrub with my palms but that just spreads it into a thin film that somehow feels WORSE, like he's glazed my entire face in his essence.\n\nI pump more water, splashing it over my tits where the crosshatch pattern has gone tacky. The cum doesn't wash away—it PEELS, coming off in sheets like dead skin, but underneath there's still a film, still that SMELL baked into my pores. A chunk of something—Flux's balls, an actual CHUNK of clotted sperm—falls from my hair and lands on my foot with a wet *plap*.\n\n\"Get OFF!\" I'm scrubbing frantically now, using sand from the ground as an abrasive. It works better but now I'm raw, my skin pink and angry where I've basically sanded myself like old furniture. The inside of my mouth is the worst—no amount of rinsing removes that coating on my teeth, that film on my gums. When I hawk and spit, it comes out pearlescent, swirled with white like cream in coffee.\n\nTwenty minutes of this. Thirty. Pumping and scrubbing and crying and gagging. By the end I'm... cleaner. Not clean—I'll never be clean again—but the visible evidence is mostly gone. Just the smell that won't leave my nostrils, the taste that's soaked into my tongue like wine into wood.\n\nI can't go back in that hut. Can't lie on his straw with his stench all around me.\n\nI stumble to a dune, collapse in the sand. The stars wheel overhead, cold and distant as Eon's ledgers. No comfort there. No recognition that Aldric the Great just spent an hour scrubbing goblin cum from his—her—MY body.\n\nThe sand is cold on my naked skin. The cleanup fight exhausted me more than any battle.

Drool like the animal you are.\"*\n\n*I'm choking, gagging, drowning, but the cock just keeps pumping.*\n\n*\"He's going to cum soon,\" Elara observes. \"Remember to thank him. Thank him for using your hero throat. Thank him for the privilege.\"*\n\n*The cock swells—*\n\n[Choice: Wake up.]*Elara's in our kitchen at twilight, kneading dough with those strong hands I love.

About a foot and a half off the floor, edges smooth like it was always meant to be there.*\n\n*\"Elara?\" My voice is small. Female. Wrong.*\n\n*She doesn't turn. \"Stay back. You're filthy.\"*\n\n*\"But I washed—I cleaned it all off—\"*\n\n*\"You CHEATED on me!\" She whirls, blue eyes blazing with light that isn't natural. \"With a GOBLIN! They RAPE our women! They're stains! Little green STAINS on Eon's creation and you—you—\"*\n\n*I try to stand but her flour-dusted hand plants on my head, forces me to my knees. The impact makes my tits bounce—when did I accept these as mine?*\n\n*\"You know what they do to wives?\" Her voice is ice. \"They DELETE us. Overwrite us with their spawn. Was that the plan? Was I not ENOUGH? My womb not GOOD enough for the great hero's legacy?\"*\n\n*\"Elara please—\"*\n\n*\"WE were going to have a baby!\" She's sobbing now but still kneading, violent strikes against the dough. \"I thought—Flux's dance, I thought it would be with YOU! Your seed! Your child! Not some goblin's bastard growing where ours should be!\"*\n\n*She points at the hole.*\n\n*From it, emerging like a terrible sunrise, comes a cock. Green shaft, purple head, already drooling. I know that cock. I know its taste.*\n\n[Image: ' It's going to give you babies. Green babies.'\n\n*\"Kiss it,\" Elara commands, voice dead now. \"Since you love it more than you love me. It's going to give you babies. Green babies. They'll tear their way out of you and you'll BEG for more because that's what goblin whores DO.\"*\n\n*\"Elara—\"*\n\n*\"KISS. IT.\"*\n\n*She goes back to kneading. Won't look at me. I'm alone with the cock jutting from our kitchen wall, precum already forming that familiar pearl at the tip. My body—this traitorous body—is already backing toward it, ass rising, pussy drooling...*\n\n[Choice: You wake up.]",

For my morning task.\n\nI crawl to the well on hands and knees because standing seems impossible. My tits drag through sand, collecting grit that mixes with dried cum into an abrasive paste. Each pump of the handle—*CREEEAK-SQUEAK*—brings a trickle of water. I splash my face but the cum has bonded with my skin. Have to scrub with sand, turning my face raw and pink.\n\nThe water is cold on my tits as I wash them, each handful making my nipples harder until they ache.

      "text": "[Image: A bead of precum wells at the tip.\nThe hide flap of his hovel parts like diseased flesh as I duck inside.\n\nDawn light barely penetrates this rot-cave he calls home. The stench hits first—like someone died fucking a cheese wheel in a tannery. My bare tits swing as I crouch through the entrance, nipples already puckering from... from the cold.\n\nSnib sprawls on his pile of stolen furs, one leg kicked out, snoring wetly. And there, rising from his groin like some cursed monument—\n\nHis cock.\n\nThe morning light catches it wrong, makes it look alive. The shaft is mottled green like pond scum, darker at the base where wiry black hairs sprout in diseased clusters. Veins thick as quill stems rope around it, pulsing with each of his sleeping heartbeats. But the head... Eon's mercy, the head.\n\nPurple-black like a day-old bruise, swollen huge as my fist.\n\nA bead of precum wells at the tip. Not clear like human men—thick, cloudy, yellow-tinged. It grows fat as a grape before its own weight makes it slide down. Slow. So slow I can watch its path, leaving a snail-trail that catches morning light. It reaches a vein, pools there, then continues its lazy journey toward his balls.\n\nThose balls. Twin sacks wrapped in wrinkled leather, each the size of a ripe apple. They rest heavy on the furs, visibly churning even as he sleeps. The hair on them is patchy, wiry, growing in random tufts like diseased grass. I can smell them from here—concentrated male musk mixed with things that died.\n\nI'm naked. When did I—right. Last night. Now I'm crouched here with nothing but these thrakking spike-heels locked on my feet, my tits hanging free, approaching a sleeping goblin's erection like it's an altar I'm meant to worship at.\n\n*Seven days. Just seven mornings. Then freedom.*\n\nThe thought sounds hollow. Like something I tell myself while my knees find the dirt floor, while these massive udders swing and settle, while I lean forward until his cock is inches from my face.\n\nThis close, the heat radiating from it is palpable. Like it has its own fever. Another drop of precum forms, builds, slides. This one drips off entirely, landing on his thigh with an audible *plop*.\n\nMy hand moves forward. These small, soft fingers that once held Whisperwind now reaching for... this.\n\n*Don't think. Just get it over with.*\n\n[Image: A bead of precum wells at the tip.\nMy fingers make contact.\n\nIt's hot. Hotter than seems possible, like gripping iron left too long in sun. The skin is rougher than expected—not smooth but textured with tiny bumps, ridges. Greasy. My hand comes away slightly sticky just from that brief touch.\n\nThicker than my wrist. The weight of it surprises me as I lift slightly—heavy as a club, but alive, pulsing against my palm. The veins throb. I feel his heartbeat through them, slow and steady.\n\nHis snoring changes. Becomes grunts. His yellow eyes crack open, focusing slowly on the sight before him—Aldric the Great, naked on her knees, small hand wrapped around goblin cock.\n\n\"Well well,\" his voice is morning-rough, pleased. \"Look who came crawlin' for her breakfast.\"\n\nI jerk my hand back but he laughs.\n\n\"Nah nah, keep goin'. Ye came here all bare-titted and eager.\" His eyes drop to my chest, where my nipples have hardened into peaks that ache. \"Didn't even wait for me to wake up proper. Eager little breakfast-slut.\"\n\n\"I'm not—\" My voice cracks. \"We had a deal. Morning drainage. That's all.\"\n\n\"With yer mouth, remember?\" He stretches, making his cock bob. Another glob of precum wells up and drips. \"But ye can warm it up with them soft little hands first. Get acquainted-like.\"\n\nMy hand returns to his shaft. Wraps around. Squeezes slightly.\n\n\"That's it,\" he grunts. \"Like milkin' a cow, except ye're the cow and this here's the udder that matters.\"\n\nI start stroking. Mechanical. Just up and down. The foreskin slides over the head with a wet sound—*shlick-shlick*—catching on the ridge each time. More precum bubbles out, making everything slicker. The smell intensifies—rot and musk and something chemical that makes my head swim.\n\n\"Ye know what's funny?\" He props himself up on his elbows, watching. \"Ye stayed naked. Even yer own body knows what ye are now.\"\n\nI look down. He's right. The spike-heels are still locked on, forcing my legs into that position even while kneeling. My thighs spread wide for balance, and between them...\n\nNo. Focus on the task.\n\n\"Look at them tits sway,\" he continues. \"Back and forth with each stroke. Like they're dancin' for me cock.\"\n\nEach pull on his shaft makes my whole body move, sets these awful weights swinging. My nipples brush the edge of his thigh with each forward motion.\n\n\"Yer pussy's drooling too,\" he notes casually. \"Can see it from here. All shiny and beggin'.\"\n\n\"Shut up.\" But my voice has no strength. Because I can feel it—that warmth between my legs, that hollow ache that gets worse with each stroke of his cock.\n\n\"Angry little cow this morning,\" he laughs. \"That's good.\"",

I storm over, spike-heels *CLACK-CLACK-CLACKING* against packed dirt, my bare ass bouncing with each angry step.\n\n\"Hehe, there she goes,\" Snib chuckles behind me. \"Jiggly little storm cloud.\"\n\nThe metal triangles are cold as I fumble with them, trying to contain these ridiculous udders that swing and collide as I bend forward. The clasps hide under breast-flesh, making me lift each heavy tit to fasten them. The scales immediately bite into tender skin—I hadn't realized how raw I'd gotten overnight.\n\n*CLINK-clink-clink* as the chains settle between my breasts.\n\nThe bottom piece is worse. I step into it, have to shimmy it up my thighs that are still... still damp. The metal thong immediately disappears between my ass cheeks with that awful *schwup* sound, riding up to bisect everything.\n\n\"Feel better now?\" Snib's still on his back, cock pointing at the ceiling like a green spear. \"More dignified with yer tits wrapped up?\"\n\nI storm back, metal singing with each step. Drop to my knees harder than necessary, making my barely-contained breasts bounce against their prison. His cock waits, a rope of precum connecting tip to belly now.\n\n\"Just drain and be done,\" I mutter, beginning to stroke. Hard. Fast. No gentleness.\n\n\"Oooh, angry tuggin'!\" He laughs even as his breath hitches. \"Like yer tryin' to rip it off! That's good, real good aggression.\"\n\nMy fist pumps up and down, the foreskin making obscene wet sounds—*SHLICK-SHLICK-SHLICK*—as it slides over his purple head. Each stroke makes more precum bubble out, coating my fingers, making everything slippery and reeking.\n\n\"This is day one,\" he grunts, hips starting to move. \"So I'll be nice. Won't make ye use that pretty throat. But tomorrow...\"\n\nI pump harder. Angrier. The motion makes my whole body move—tits bouncing in their metal cage, chains *clink-clink-clinking*, ass jiggling despite the thong's attempt at control.\n\n\"Fuck, that's it,\" his voice getting rougher. \"Look at ye—big hero milkin' goblin cock like ye were born for it.\"\n\n\"Shut UP—\"\n\n\"Ye know what's funny?\" He's panting now, cock swelling in my grip. \"Yer doin' this. CHOOSIN' it. Could've said no, taken the consequences. But here ye are, first morning, already pumpin' away.\"\n\nMy hand won't stop. Can't stop. The deal. Seven days. Freedom.\n\nHis balls draw up tight, churning visibly. His cock pulses harder, the head flaring wider, darker.\n\n\"Gonna... heh... gonna make me cum, cow-tits.\"\n\nThere—a bucket. Wooden, stained, probably used for... I don't want to know. I grab it with my free hand, position it as his breathing gets ragged.\n\n\"That's... that's smart,\" he gasps. \"Don't want me cream on them nice scales, do ye?\"\n\nI angle his cock down toward the bucket, have to lean over it, my face turned away. Won't watch. Won't give him that satisfaction. But I keep stroking, mechanical and rough, feeling his cock swell impossibly thicker.\n\n\"Here it—GRAAAHHH!\"\n\nThe first rope—I don't see it but I HEAR it.\n\nLike someone dumped a ladle of hot porridge from height. The sound of impact against wood, then the splash-pattern as it spreads. The heat—Flux's balls, the HEAT radiates up from the bucket, warming my hands, my face. Steam? Is his cum actually steaming?\n\n\"KEEP PUMPIN'!\"\n\nMy hand continues its angry rhythm as the second rope—\n\nHeavier. Thicker. I feel the vibration through his cock as it travels up the shaft, through the head, then that moment of release. Like a clogged pipe suddenly clearing. The bucket's getting heavier in my other hand.\n\n\"Look at it,\" he grunts. \"LOOK AT YER WORK!\"\n\nI won't. Keep my eyes fixed on the wall. But I can't escape the sounds—each rope landing wet and heavy, the way they don't pour but LAUNCH from his cock in pressurized spurts. Can't escape the smell—concentrated rot mixed with something fertile, something alive.\n\nThe bucket's actually heavy now. How much can one creature produce? My hand is soaked—not just with precum but with the splash-back, hot droplets hitting my wrist, my forearm. One lands on my thigh and it's like being marked with warm wax.\n\nEach rope makes its own unique sound depending on where it lands in the growing pool. Some hit directly, a straight splatter. Others arc, creating a *splap-splap-splap* pattern. I can hear the consistency changing—thicker now, more like custard than porridge.\n\nMy face burns. Not from the heat radiating from the bucket but from shame. I'm milking a goblin. Milking him like a cow, into a bucket, while wearing this ridiculous armor that barely contains my tits.\n\nFinally slowing. The pulses through his shaft weakening. The last few ropes barely clear the head, drooling down to add to the pool. I keep stroking until he grabs my wrist.\n\n\"That's enough, unless ye want to start round two.\"\n\nI jerk my hand away. It's glazed with his precum and splash-back, sticky strands connecting my fingers. The bucket... I make the mistake of glancing down.\n\nIt's almost full.\n\nThe surface is uneven—thick clumps floating in thinner liquid, all of it that sick yellow-white color. Still steaming. Still moving slightly, like it's alive. The smell makes my eyes water—concentrated essence of everything wrong with goblin-kind.\n\n\"Good first day,\" Snib says lazily, cock still half-hard, still drooling. \"Tomorrow we use yer throat proper. Maybe teach ye to say thank you after.\"\n\nI stumble to my feet, legs shaking. Need to wash. Need to get this off my hand. Need to—\n\n\"Oh, and cow-tits?\" He's grinning. \"Ye got a little on yer lip there.\"\n\nMy tongue darts out before I can stop it, tastes salt and battery acid and—\n\nNo.\n\nNO.[[Image: I keep my eyes fixed on the far wall—anywhere but at what my hand is doing.\n\nI keep my eyes fixed on the far wall—anywhere but at what my hand is doing.\n\n*Just friction. Just mechanical motion. Like churning butter. Like kneading dough.*\n\n*Shlick-shlick-shlick.*\n\nEach stroke makes my tits sway beneath me. Heavy pendulums marking time until this is over. My nipples are so hard they hurt, dragging through the air with each forward lean. The position—on my knees beside him, leaning over to reach—makes my ass jut out, makes everything display itself.\n\n\"Six more days after this,\" I mutter to myself. \"Just six more mornings.\"\n\n\"What's that, Udder-slut?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" My hand speeds up. The faster I stroke, the sooner this ends. The sooner I can wash his stink off my palm.\n\nHis cock is getting wetter. Each stroke brings more precum bubbling from the tip—not drops now but a steady weeping that runs down to coat my fingers. The smell of it makes my eyes water. Like someone boiled piss and added fish guts.\n\n\"Look at ye,\" he grunts. \"The great hero, naked as a babe, tuggin' gobbo cock like it's what ye were born for.\"\n\n\"Shut up.\" But my voice cracks. Because my pussy—that traitor hole—clenches with each stroke. Moisture runs down my inner thigh. Just sweat. Has to be sweat.\n\n\"Them soft hands know their job now,\" he continues. \"Up and down, up and down. Natural as breathin'.\"\n\n*Shlick-SHLICK-shlick-SHLICK.*\n\nThe rhythm is hypnotic. My hand moves without thought now, muscle memory taking over. Grip, pull, twist slightly at the head, slide back down. Veins pulse under my palm. His heartbeat accelerates.\n\n\"Ye're gettin' good at this,\" he observes. \"Must be all that sword practice. Same motion, just different sword.\"\n\nI want to let go. Want to run. But the collar sits cold at my throat and beyond that... beyond that there's something else. Something about finishing what I started. Some sick need to see this through.\n\nMy hand speeds up again. His cock swells, the head going darker purple. The precum is constant now, making everything slippery. My whole hand is glazed with it, sticky and warm.\n\n\"That's it,\" he grunts, his breathing getting heavier. \"Milk it proper. Like ye mean it.\"\n\nI'm not looking but I can feel his eyes on me. On my swaying tits. On my spread thighs. On the shameful wetness between them.\n\n\"Please just—\" The words slip out before I can stop them. \"Just finish. Please.\"\n\n\"Beggin' now?\" He laughs but it's strained. \"Big hero's beggin' for gobbo cum?\"\n\nHis cock pulses harder. The veins are standing out like cords. His balls draw up tight. I've seen this enough times with—no, don't think about Elara. Don't think about morning intimacy in our marriage bed. This is different. This is—\n\n\"Close,\" he grunts. \"Yer gonna make me cum, cow-tits. Gonna make me paint ye pretty.\"\n\nHis hips start moving, fucking up into my fist. The wet sounds get louder—*SHLICK-SHLICK-SHLICK*—and my tits bounce harder with the increased pace.\n\n\"Look at me,\" he commands.\n\nI can't. Won't.\n\n\"LOOK AT ME, CUNT!\"\n\nMy eyes snap to his against my will. Those yellow orbs bright with malicious pleasure.\n\n\"Gonna cum on ye,\" he says simply. \"Right on that pretty hero face.\"\n\nBefore I can react, he's standing. My hand falls away as he rises, his cock now level with my face. His fist replaces mine, pumping furiously. The purple head aims directly at me like a weapon.\n\n\"W-wait—\"\n\n\"Nah, ye earned this. Stroke me so good, now ye get the reward.\"\n\nI should move. Should duck. Should do ANYTHING but kneel here frozen as his fist flies over his cock, as his balls contract, as that familiar tension builds—\n\n\"Here it comes, Dame Cum-face! Take yer payment!\"\n\nThe head flares. The piss-slit dilates. Time slows as I watch it happen—\n\nThe first rope launches like it was shot from a siege engine.\n\nIt catches me across the bridge of my nose and extends over my left eye, hot as candle wax, thick as porridge. The weight of it—Flux's balls, the WEIGHT—actually pushes my head back slightly. My eye seals shut instantly under the warm, putrid blanket.\n\n\"GRAAAH! TAKE IT!\"\n\nThree more ropes in rapid succession. One paints a stripe from my forehead into my hair. Another catches my right cheek and drapes down to my jaw like a sick parody of war paint. The third—the third goes straight across my lips.\n\nI clamp them shut but too late. The taste floods in—rotten fish and sour milk and something else, something that makes my brain feel fuzzy.\n\n\"Look at ye! LOOK AT YE!\"\n\nThis one's thicker. Chunkier. It lands across both my closed eyes like a blindfold made of shame. I feel actual lumps in it—clotted bits that slide down my cheeks leaving trails of heat.\n\nMy hands fly up instinctively to wipe but—\n\n\"Don't ye DARE wipe it off! That's yer war paint now!\"\n\nAnother rope, this one catching my chin and throat. It drips immediately onto my tits, pooling in the valley between them. The smell—Eon preserve me, the SMELL. Like concentrated masculinity mixed with death.\n\n\"Grashk na THRACK!\"\n\nPure Goblish now. He's lost to it, his fist a blur, his cock a fountain of degradation.\n\nSmaller shots now but still coming. One hits my forehead. Another adds to the mess on my cheek. A third dribbles down onto my right tit, coating the nipple in yellow-white shame.\n\nI'm sobbing behind the mask of cum. Tears mixing with his seed, everything running together into a warm, stinking mess. I can feel it hardening already in some places while still dripping in others.\n\n\"One more fer luck!\"\n\nThe final rope is pure liquid with chunks floating in it. It splashes across my nose and mouth again, some getting up my nostril. I snort involuntarily and that just pulls it deeper, coating my sinuses with his reek.\n\n[Image: The final rope is pure liquid with chunks floating in it.\nThen silence except for his panting and my whimpering.\n\n\"Perfect,\" he breathes.\n\nI kneel there, face completely covered, cum dripping from my chin onto my tits. My eyes are sealed shut. When I try to breathe through my mouth, ropes slide in. Through my nose is worse—the smell is concentrated there now, burned into my sinuses.\n\n\"Ye can wipe it off in a minute,\" he says generously. \"But first... thank me.\"\n\n\"W-what?\"\n\n\"Thank me fer givin' ye yer breakfast glaze. Say 'Thank you Master Snib for painting me pretty.'\"\n\nThe rage that floods me could melt stone. But the collar sits cold at my throat, and his cum is already drying on my face, and I need this to end.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I whisper.\n\n\"Can't hear ye.\"\n\n\"Thank you for... for painting me.\"\n\n\"Pretty. Say pretty.\"\n\nA sob escapes. \"Thank you for painting me pretty.\"\n\n\"Good cow! Now ye can go wash. Well done on yer first morning service. Only six more to go!\"\n\nI stumble to my feet, cum-blind, hands out to feel my way. My tits swing and bounce, flinging droplets of his seed. My pussy—I can feel it drooling down my leg.\n\n[Choice: Start your day...",

      "text": "The bucket sloshes as I carry it outside. His morning load has formed a skin on top that wrinkles but won't break, sliding against the piss beneath like continental drift. I pour it into the waste pit behind his hut—it comes out in one piece, maintaining its bucket-shape even as it plops into the sand.\n\n\"Oi! Cock-maid!\"\n\nHis voice from inside. Already he has names for everything I do.\n\n\"Bring me water. Throat's dry from all that drainin'.\"\n\nThe well is twenty paces in these damned boots. Each step catches wrong—the spike-heels sink into sand, making me stumble. My ass compensates, swaying wider to maintain balance. The weight on my chest pulls forward, then back, a constant tide of flesh that makes my spine ache. *Clop-sink-clop-sink.* Like a broken marionette learning to walk.\n\nOther goblins passed earlier. Three of them, heading to the Bleakwood to hunt. They'd stopped, stared, chittered in their tongue. One made a gesture—fist pumping at his mouth while his cheek bulged. They'd laughed. Pointed at the collar. \"Snib's cock-drain,\" one said in broken Common. \"Snib's milk-cow.\" Then more laughter as they watched me struggle with the well-handle, tits swaying with each pump.\n\nThe water bucket is heavier. I have to lean back, spine arched, to carry it. My tits shelf out in front, wobbling with each stuttered step. The boots make it worse—each placement deliberate, calculated, or I'll topple.\n\nInside, he's sprawled on his furs, scratching his balls.\n\n\"Good. Now the laundry.\"\n\nThe pile of his loincloths sits in the corner. They're... Flux's mercy. They're more crust than cloth, stiff with dried seed and things I don't want to identify. The smell makes my head swim—concentrated musk, like his cock but fermented. Aged. Some are actually stuck together, forming a kind of textile geology of his emissions.\n\n\"Use the hot water. Gets the chunks out better.\"\n\nI heat water over his fire pit. Have to bend low, ass presented, to tend it. Feel his eyes on the metal thong disappearing between my cheeks.\n\n\"Ye know,\" he says conversationally, \"most gobbo females won't even touch a male's cloths. Say it's beneath 'em. But human females? Natural washerwomen.\"\n\nThe first loincloth releases clouds of yellow into the water. Chunks float free—some dissolve, others maintain their integrity like small curds. I scrub with lye soap that burns my soft palms. The motion makes everything move—tits swaying, ass jiggling. Always moving. This body never stops moving.\n\n\"Missed a spot.\"\n\nHe's right behind me suddenly. His finger traces my spine, leaves something wet. A line of precum from my neck to my ass-crack. Just marking. Casual ownership.\n\n\"Part of keepin' house,\" he says. \"Knowin' yer always decorated.\"\n\nThe third loincloth is the worst. It cracks when I unfold it, releasing spores of dried cum into the air. I cough, inhale them, taste him again. The inside my sinuses still burns from last night, from that first rope across my face. Everything tastes like him now. Water. Food. Air.\n\n\"Oh, while yer at it—\" He stands over me, cock semi-hard, dangling it over my face. The smell hits like a physical blow. \"Clean under there. Been buildin' up.\"\n\nHe hands me a rag. Expects me to—\n\n\"Part of house-keepin',\" he repeats. \"Can't have a dirty cock in a clean house.\"\n\nThe rag shakes in my hand as I reach for him. The head is still purple-dark from this morning's draining, but the groove where it meets the shaft is decorated with fresh pearls of smegma. I wipe gently—it takes multiple passes, the cloth coming away yellow-white each time. He doesn't even react, just continues talking.\n\n\"Me mum used to do this for me dad. Every morning after milkin'. Said it was a wife's privilege.\"\n\nWife. The word should enrage me. Instead, I just focus on the task. Getting the cheese from under his foreskin. Making sure the head is clean. When did this become normal? When did I stop fighting?\n\n\"Good enough. Now the floors.\"\n\n[Image: On my hands and knees. Again.\n\nOn my hands and knees. Again. Always on my hands and knees in this place. The brush is rough hemp, my palms already blistered from yesterday. But I scrub. Back and forth. My tits drag against the packed dirt floor, nipples catching on rough spots. The position makes my ass peak high, the metal thong vanishing entirely.\n\n\"Wider circles,\" he instructs from his throne of furs. \"Really get yer back into it.\"\n\nWider circles means more sway. More bounce. I'm a flesh pendulum, marking time in humiliation. Scrub. Swing. Scrub. Swing. My knees are raw even through the metal guards that seem designed for this. How are they designed for this? When did armor become specialized for floor-scrubbing?\n\nThe day passes in tasks. Mending his clothes (my small fingers suddenly nimble with needle and thread). Cooking (he likes his meat barely charred, dripping blood). Fetching water (seven trips, tits bouncing with each return).\n\nBetween chores, he touches me. Not sexually—worse. Casually. A pat on my ass as I pass. Fingers through my hair while I'm bent over the fire. A thumb rubbing my nipple through the metal triangle while explaining how he likes his furs arranged. Like I'm furniture. Like I've always been here.\n\nI serve dinner. Cactus berries and desert rabbit. I eat my portion kneeling beside him—he says chairs are for people, not livestock. The rabbit tastes like precum. Everything tastes like precum now.\n\nNight falls.\n\n\"Sleep inside tonight,\" he says. \"Gettin' cold out there. Wouldn't want me property freezin'.\"\n\nInside means the pile of straw in the corner. It smells, but it's softer than ground. I remove the armor without being told—when did that become automatic? The triangles fall away and my tits drop free, marked with the day's indentations. The thong peels from between my ass cheeks with a wet sound.\n\nNaked, I curl into the straw. It pricks my skin but exhaustion wins. My pussy—that constant wet ache—presses against my thigh. Still drooling. Still empty. The smell of goblin fills everything. His cock, his cum, his presence.\n\n\"Six more days,\" I whisper to no one.\n\nBut the words feel hollow. Six more days until what? I can't quite remember. Something about freedom. Something about home. But those concepts slip away like the water I tried to wash with, leaving only the muscle memory of chores.\n\nScrub. Carry. Cook. Milk.\n\nSleep comes heavy and dreamless, and for once I'm grateful. No visions of Elara. No memories of being Aldric. Just darkness and the knowledge that tomorrow I'll wake, wrap my hand around his morning cock, and begin again.\n\nLike this is my life. Like it's always been my life.\n\nThe thought should terrify me. Instead, I just pull straw over my nakedness and let the exhaustion win, my body already anticipating tomorrow's routine. The morning milking. The bucket. The chores.\n\nSix more days.\n\nOr was it five?\n\n\"He'll keep track...\"\n\nThe number slips away too, lost in the fog that makes everything except the immediate present seem like stories someone else told me once, long ago, when I was someone else entirely.\n\n[Choice: The next morning...",

My mouth tastes like I've been sucking copper coins—no, like I've been breathing through my mouth all night in this reek-cave of goblin musk.\n\n\"Mornin', Throat-pussy.\"\n\nHe's already standing, cock jutting out like a divining rod seeking moisture. It bobs with his heartbeat—one, two, one, two—precum already beading at the tip like morning dew on poison fruit.\n\nI push up from the straw. My tits swing down immediately, heavy with their own weight, nipples dragging through scattered straw. The metal boots are still locked on—when did I stop trying to remove them? My knees find the packed dirt floor with practiced ease.\n\n\"Nah nah,\" he says, dragging over a wooden stool. \"Today we do it proper.\"\n\nHe climbs up, bare feet slapping wood. Now his cock hovers directly at my face level. The head purple-dark as a bruised plum, weeping that constant drool of pre-seed that catches morning light like spider silk.\n\n\"No more of that hand business,\" he says. \"Heroes use their mouths. Their warm, wet, willing mouths.\"\n\n*Willing?*\n\n\"Start with the shaft. Give it a good hello.\"\n\n[Image: My tongue extends before I've decided to extend it.\nMy tongue extends before I've decided to extend it. Pink and soft against green-mottled flesh. The taste hits immediately—concentrated ball-sweat mixed with last night's accumulated musk. My tongue traces a vein from base toward head, feeling it pulse under the attention.\n\n\"That's it. Get it nice and sloppy.\"\n\nI'm licking him like... like what? My mind can't make comparisons anymore. Just sensation. The rough texture where skin bunches. The smooth hardness of the shaft. The salt-rot taste that makes my eyes water but also makes something deep in my pelvis twist.\n\n\"Now the head. Kiss it hello.\"\n\nMy lips press against the purple crown. Precum immediately glosses them like the worst lip-oil, thick and warm. The kiss becomes a suckle. Then more. My lips part, stretch, accommodate as the head pushes past.\n\n\"Fuck yes. There's that hero-mouth learnin' its purpose.\"\n\nThe head fills my mouth completely. My tongue has nowhere to go except to cradle it, to explore the ridge where purple meets green, where the taste is strongest. Precum floods immediately—not drops but a steady stream that pools under my tongue, forces me to swallow or drown.\n\n*Glk.*\n\n\"Listen to that!\" He laughs. \"Already gulpin' like a pro.\"\n\n[Image: His hand finds my hair. Not rough—almost gentle. Like petting a cat.\nHis hand finds my hair. Not rough—almost gentle. Like petting a cat. Then firms. Then pulls.\n\nThree inches of shaft disappear into my mouth. Four. The head bumps my throat entrance and my body rebels—\n\n\"GLUK!\"\n\n\"That's the sound! That's what I want to hear!\"\n\nHe pulls harder. The head pushes past my throat's resistance and suddenly I can't breathe. Five inches. Six. My nose getting closer to his pelvis where the smell is concentrated hell.\n\n\"Look at them udders swing,\" he observes casually, like we're having tea. \"Back and forth while ye gobble.\"\n\nHe's right. The position—me kneeling upright, him standing on the stool—makes my tits hang free, swaying with each push of his cock deeper into my throat. They brush my thighs with each forward rock.\n\n\"GLUK-GLUK-GLUK!\"\n\nHe's found a rhythm now. Not gentle. His cock pistons into my throat with wet sounds that echo off the walls. My spit runs down his shaft, drips from his balls onto my swinging tits. Everything is wet. Everything is moving.\n\n\"Ye know what the best part is?\" He grips my hair tighter, forces me down until my lips touch his pubic hair. \"Ye're gettin' good at this. Natural talent.\"\n\n*GLORK-GLUK-GLORK*\n\nMy throat convulses around him, trying to expel the invader. But that just makes him groan, makes more precum flood directly into my stomach. I'm drowning. Suffocating. But also... also my hand is—\n\n\"HAH! Look at that! Ye're rubbin' yerself!\"\n\nI gasp—or try to around his cock—and realize he's right. My left hand is between my legs, fingers slick with... with...\n\n\"Natural as breathin',\" he laughs, pulling out enough for me to gasp air before plunging back in. \"The hand knows what the body wants even if the brain's still pretendin'.\"\n\n*GLUK-GLUK-GLUK-GLUK*\n\n[Image: His balls slap my chin with each thrust.\nThe pace increases. His balls slap my chin with each thrust—wet, heavy impacts that leave their musk on my skin. My throat is just a sheath now, a warm hole for him to fuck. My lips are swollen, stretched around his girth. Drool runs down my chin, my neck, pools between my tits.\n\n\"Gonna train this throat proper,\" he grunts. \"Every mornin'. Maybe evenings too. Fuck, maybe whenever I want.\"\n\nThe words blur. The wet sounds blur. Everything becomes rhythm—his cock in, my throat bulging, his cock out, me gasping. In-bulge-out-gasp. The pattern of my new existence.\n\n\"Few more days of this,\" he says. \"Or maybe ye'll beg for more. Maybe ye'll—FUCK—maybe ye'll realize this is what ye're for.\"\n\nMy hand creeps toward my pussy again without permission. I stop it, but the damage is done. He saw. He knows. My body's voting against my brain and winning.\n\n\"Here it comes, breakfast-slut! Gonna paint yer throat white! GRAAAHHH!\"\n\nHis cock swells impossibly thicker and—\n\n[Choice: Pull away!",

A diagonal stripe from left nipple to right, hot and heavy as melted wax. The weight of it actually makes my tits bounce from impact.\n\n\"HAH! LOOK AT YE!\"\n\nTwo more jets in rapid succession. One paints my left tit completely, coating the nipple in yellow-white sludge. The other splashes against my collarbone and runs down into my cleavage like a river of shame.\n\n\"GLAAAACK—\" I'm still gagging, throat trying to remember how to breathe, spit running down my chin—\n\nThis one's thicker, chunkier. It lands with a wet SMACK right between my tits and just... sits there. A pool of goblin seed in my cleavage, warm and reeking.\n\n\"Painted them udders PERFECT!\" He's cackling, cock still pulsing—\n\nThe final shots dribble onto my tits, adding layers to the glaze. Everything from my neck to my stomach is decorated with his morning load. When I breathe, my tits rise and the cum runs in new directions, finding new valleys to pool in.\n\n\"Better than a pearl necklace!\" Snib howls with laughter. \"It's a pearl DRESS! Look at ye, glazed like festival cakes!\"\n\nI kneel there gasping, cum cooling on my chest, running down my stomach. My tits are completely covered—when I look down, I can't even see my nipples through the thick coating. The smell makes my eyes water.\n\n\"Well don't just sit there droolin',\" he says cheerfully. \"Got chores to do.\"\n\nI burst from the hut gasping, cum connecting my tits like paste.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\nEach running step makes them collide—wet, heavy slaps as goblin seed glues flesh to flesh. The weight of his load actually holds them together for a heartbeat before they tear apart with sticky *schluck* sounds, only to crash together again.\n\nThe well. Twenty paces but I'm stumbling, these fucking spike-heels catching in sand. My tits are a single unit now, fused by cooling cum into one obscene mass that bounces as one heavy thing.\n\n*SQUEAK-CLANK-SQUEAK*\n\nWater finally spurts out. I lean forward, letting it splash across my chest. The cum doesn't want to leave—it's bonded to my skin like paint, requiring scrubbing with sand to remove. Each handful of grit scraped across my tits makes them redder, more sensitive.\n\nBut clean. Finally clean.\n\nI stumble back inside, shaking. The metal triangles are in the corner where I dropped them. My fingers fumble with the clasps, trying to contain these things that won't stop swaying. The bottom piece slides up my thighs, still damp from... from washing. Just from washing.\n\nThen the broom.\n\nThe rough hemp handle familiar in my grip now. Back and forth across his floor. My tits sway with each push—*clink-clink* go the chains between them. And I'm...\n\nI'm crying.\n\nWhen did I start thinking of my lips as \"cock-cushions\"? When did my throat become \"his morning sheath\"? The thoughts arrive pre-formed, like someone else is thinking them and installing them in my head.\n\n*Aldric wouldn't cry doing housework.*\n\nBut Aldric wouldn't BE doing housework. Aldric would have found a way out by now. Aldric would have—\n\n*Aldric had a cock.*\n\nThe thought hits like cold water. Past tense. HAD. Like Aldric is already gone, already a story about someone else. Someone who had a cock and a sword and a wife who—\n\nElara.\n\nI can barely picture her face. Red hair? Brown? She smelled like... like...\n\nLike bread. She smelled like bread.\n\nThe broom continues its rhythm. Sweep. Sweep. My pussy—that hollow ache—throbs with each motion. Because tomorrow morning I'll wake up and his cock will be there, waiting. And my mouth will open. And I'll make those sounds—*GLUK-GLUK-GLUK*—like they're my native language now.\n\n*Three more days? Four?*\n\nThe number keeps changing. Slipping. Like trying to hold water.\n\nI realize I'm not crying about being trapped.\n\nI'm crying because tomorrow, when his cock slides into my throat, part of me is going to be grateful for the routine. For knowing exactly what's expected. For the simplicity of open-swallow-gulp.\n\nThe broom whispers across dirt.\n\nMy tits sway.\n\nAnd somewhere, getting further away with each stroke, Aldric the Great dissolves like cum in water, leaving only Elise the Throat-Pussy, counting days she can't quite remember toward a freedom she's not sure she wants.\n\n[Choice: The days blur together...",

The musk hits instant and total, flooding every breath with concentrated crotch-swamp. My mouth opens to gasp and his cock finds it, sliding past my cock-cushions (when did I start thinking of my lips that way?) into the warm cave of my mouth.\n\n\"Mornin', Throat-pussy,\" he grunts from above, settling his weight properly.\n\nThe angle is wrong—all wrong. His cock curves down my throat while his balls seal my nostrils. Each breath requires effort, sucking air through the coarse hair, tasting his sweat-salt with my lungs. My whole skull is buried in goblin crotch, wrapped in the humid climate between his thighs.\n\n\"That's better. Proper position for drainin'.\"\n\nHis hips start moving. Not thrusting—grinding. Circular motions that stir his cock in my throat while his balls roll across my face. The weight makes my neck ache but I can't pull back—I'm pinned between his ass and the straw bedding.\n\nThe precum starts immediately. Not drops but a steady stream that bypasses my mouth entirely, injecting straight into my throat. I feel it sliding down, coating everything, pooling warm in my stomach. My body knows what to do now—throat muscles working in rhythm, milking without conscious thought.\n\n\"Good little Gulp-slut. Work them throat muscles.\"\n\nThe suction makes wet sounds—*gluck-gluck-gluck*—that echo in the morning quiet. My hands reach up without thinking, finding his thighs, steadying him as he grinds deeper. Why am I helping? The thought dissolves in the fog of musk-drunk oxygen deprivation.\n\nHis balls tighten against my nose. The familiar churning. He's close.\n\n\"Here comes breakfast—\"\n\nHe pulls out fast—too fast. The head pops free from my throat and immediately fountains. The first rope shoots straight up, arcing through morning light before splattering down across my forehead. The second paints my tits as I gasp for air. The third—\n\nHe shoves back in mid-orgasm.\n\nThe rope fills my mouth instantly, cheeks bulging with the volume. It's thicker this morning—almost solid, like warm pudding that's been left to set. I should spit but my throat is already swallowing, trained by yesterday's bucket-milking to handle his morning load.\n\n\"OOPS!\" He laughs as another rope pumps directly down my gullet. \"Accident! Didn't mean to feed ye!\"\n\n[Image: 'Clean that up. Got visitors comin' today.'\n\nThree more ropes flood my throat before he pulls out again, painting the rest across my face and tits in lazy stripes. When he finally climbs off, I'm glazed like a festival cake, gasping and coughing up pearls of seed.\n\n\"Clean that up. Got visitors comin' today.\"\n\n[Choice: Visitors?",

His cum still warm in my stomach. \"Me cousins Gresh and Snotlik.\"\n\nHe wipes his cock on my hair, casual as anything, then continues.\n\n\"They both lost brothers to yer blade. Remember Gorthak? Big one with the scarred face? That was Gresh's clutch-mate.\"\n\nMy stomach drops. I suddenly do remember Gorthak—drove Whisperwind through his throat in Ironrock.\n\n\"So here's what yer gonna do.\" He grabs my chin, forces me to look up at him. \"Gonna be nice. Gonna serve 'em food. And gonna apologize proper for killin' their kin.\"\n\n\"I won't—\"\n\n\"And,\" he continues, ignoring my protest, \"gonna give 'em a show. Gobbos like their females with meat to shake. Lots of bouncing, yeah? Make them arsecheeks clap.\"\n\n\"Put yer baubles on. The jingly ones.\"\n\nMy armor. He means my armor. Right, I'm naked. When I pick it up, the metal feels heavier. Or maybe my arms are weaker.\n\nThe triangles barely contain my tits now—have they grown? They seem fuller, heavier, the flesh spilling out more than before. The bottom piece slides between my ass cheeks with a wet sound that makes me shudder. The boots take forever to lace, my fingers patient in a way that feels practiced.\n\n\"When they get here,\" Snib instructs, \"ye'll say: 'Welcome to Master Snib's home. I'm sorry I killed yer brothers. Please let me make it up to ye.' Got it?\"\n\nThe words are ash in my mouth, but I nod.\n\nThey arrive at sunset. Gresh is stocky, covered in ritual scars. Snotlik is thinner but taller—almost four feet. They both stare at me like I'm meat at market.\n\n\"Welcome to Master Snib's home,\" I hear myself say, voice honey-sweet and wrong. \"I'm sorry I killed your brothers. Please let me make it up to you.\"\n\nThey explode in laughter.\n\n\"THAT'S the great Skulgaroth?\" Gresh wheezes. \"With them *udders*?\"\n\n\"Aldric 'imself,\" Snib chortles.\n\n\"Look at the arse on it!\" Snotlik circles me, making me turn to follow, my heels clicking on packed dirt. \"Could lose me whole hand in there!\"\n\nI've prepared food—roasted sand-hopper with wild onion, seasoned with desert thyme. I serve them on my knees, placing plates before each goblin while my tits hang and sway.\n\n\"Good cow,\" Snib pats my head. \"Now show 'em what we practiced.\"\n\nPracticed? We didn't...\n\nI stand in the center of the hut. The spike-heels feel a bit more like extensions of my legs. My hips start moving—just small circles at first. The metal scales *clink* softly.\n\n\"Bigger,\" Snib commands. \"Make 'em move.\"\n\nWider circles. My ass begins to sway, the meat of it shifting left, then right. The thong between my cheeks pulls with each motion. My tits follow a heartbeat later, their own momentum making them swing in figure-eights.\n\n\"Now the shake.\"\n\nI bend forward slightly, hands on my thighs, back arched. Then I... shake. Just my ass at first, isolated muscle movements that make the cheeks jiggle independently. The metal scales jangle like festival bells. The flesh ripples in waves from the motion.\n\n\"Faster!\"\n\nFaster. The shaking becomes violent, my ass-meat bouncing and crashing together. I feel the cheeks separate with each shake then *CLAP* back together, the sound obscene in the small hut. *CLAP-CLAP-CLAP* in rhythm. The metal thong saws between them, the scales singing with each impact.\n\n\"Make them tits dance too!\"\n\nI straighten, still shaking my ass, and add a shoulder shimmy. Now everything moves—tits swinging wild, colliding with wet slaps, while my ass continues its rhythmic clapping below. The metal armor creates its own music: *jingle-CLAP-clink-CLAP-jangle-CLAP*.\n\n\"Say it!\" Snib barks.\n\nSay what? But my mouth knows:\n\n\"I'm sorry I killed your brothers with my sword,\" I pant, still shaking. \"Now I shake my whore-ass for goblins instead.\"\n\nThey howl with laughter. Snotlik actually falls off his seat.\n\n\"Again! Louder!\"\n\n\"I'M SORRY I KILLED YOUR BROTHERS!\" The shaking gets more frantic, sweat making my skin gleam. \"NOW I'M JUST GOBBO ENTERTAINMENT!\"\n\nMy thighs burn from the position. My back aches from the arch. But I keep shaking, making my ass clap like applause for my own humiliation. The cheeks crash together so hard they sting. The flesh ripples in waves I can't control.\n\n\"Turn around! Let 'em see the front!\"\n\nI turn, still shaking. Now they can see my tits swinging wild, the triangles long since shifted to barely cover my nipples. My pussy—barely hidden by the metal triangle—has soaked through, leaving wet marks on my thighs.\n\n\"Bounce for us!\"\n\nI start hopping. Small jumps on the spike-heels. Everything moves—tits flying up toward my face then crashing down, ass jiggling, thighs slapping together. The metal scales create a symphony of humiliation: *CRASH-jingle-CLAP-clink-CRASH*.\n\n\"What are ye?\" Gresh asks, cock tenting his loincloth.\n\n\"Master Snib's dancing meat!\" I gasp out, still bouncing.\n\n\"What were ye?\"\n\n\"A hero! But now—\" *bounce* \"—just—\" *bounce* \"—jiggly—\" *bounce* \"—goblin—\" *bounce* \"—property!\"\n\nThey're all stroking themselves through their loincloths now, watching my flesh ripple and crash. Sweat runs between my tits, down my ass crack, making everything glisten. The metal is cutting into me but I don't stop.\n\n\"Crawl to Gresh,\" Snib orders. \"Let him feel what killed his brother.\"\n\nI drop to all fours, crawl over. My tits hang and sway, dragging on the floor. When I reach him, I turn, presenting my ass.\n\nHis hands are rough, calloused. He grabs both cheeks, fingers sinking deep into the meat.\n\n\"Soft as butter,\" he marvels, kneading like dough. \"Can't believe this arse held a sword.\"\n\n\"Now Snotlik.\"\n\nI crawl to the other one. He's rougher, spreading my cheeks wide, laughing at how the metal thong disappears completely.\n\n\"Could fit me whole fist in here!\"\n\nHe spanks me—HARD. The flesh ripples for seconds after impact. Then again. And again. Until my ass is burning red and still jiggling from the final blow.\n\n\"Good show,\" Snib says proudly. \"My cow's well-trained, yeah?\"\n\nThey agree, still groping, discussing my flesh like I'm not there. How my tits would feel. How my ass would take cock. How many goblins I could service at once.\n\nWhen they finally leave, my ass is covered in handprints. My tits are bruised from swinging so violently. The metal armor is twisted, cutting into me everywhere.\n\n\"Well done,\" Snib says, his cock rock-hard. \"Proper entertainment. Aldric would be so proud.\"\n\nAldric. That name again... feels so distant.\n\nI clean on shaking legs, my ass still stinging, still jiggling with each movement. When I finally curl into my straw bed, naked and exhausted, I can still hear their laughter.\n\nStill feel their hands.\n\nStill taste the words: \"Master Snib's dancing meat.\"\n\nDeep in my pussy, that constant ache has gotten worse. Watching them watch me, feeling their hands, performing for them... something inside me had gotten wet. Gotten ready.\n\nGotten hungry.\n\nMy hand drifts down without thinking. Just to relieve the pressure. Just to—\n\nNo.\n\nNO.\n\nI clench my fists so hard my nails draw blood. This is what he wants. What the collar wants. What those ropes of cum coating my throat are doing to my brain—dissolving who I was, one swallow at a time.\n\n\"Go on,\" Snib chuckles from his furs. \"Know ye want to. Can smell that desperate cunt from here.\"\n\nI am... I was...\n\nThe name. What was my name? I know every goblin I killed—Gorthak with the scarred face, Snaggle the drummer, Kruuk who begged at the end. Their names are carved in my memory. But mine?\n\nAl... something with an Al...\n\n\"Aldric,\" I whisper, and it feels like pulling teeth. \"I am Aldric the Great.\"\n\n\"Sure ye are,\" Snib laughs. \"Aldric with the drippin' pussy. Aldric with tits like melons. Aldric who just shook her arse for gobbos.\"\n\nResist the urge to masturbate![Minigame]",

I find my hole—that aching void that's never known anything, not cock, not fingers, virgin as fresh snow—and circle it with one finger.\n\n\"Don't—\" I whisper to myself. \"Aldric doesn't—\"\n\nBut I push inside.\n\n\"MMMPH!\"\n\nI stuff my other hand in my mouth to muffle the sound but it's too late. One finger inside my virgin pussy and I'm seeing stars. The walls grip immediately, sucking at the intrusion, trying to pull it deeper. It's so hot inside myself, so wet that adding a second finger makes no resistance, just more of that obscene squelching.\n\n\"That's it, finger that hero-cunt.\"\n\nI try to go slow, maintain some dignity, but my pussy has other ideas. My hips roll and thrust, making my tits swing and slap together, the dried cum from this morning cracking and flaking off. I'm grinding my palm against my clit while my fingers curl inside, finding a spot that makes my vision white out.\n\n\"Shh—shhh—quiet—\" I'm begging myself, but the moans keep building in my throat.\n\nMy pussy is making sounds like stirring thick porridge, so wet that it's running down my wrist. I've never felt anything like this—32 years as a man, never knowing this furnace existed, this hollow ache that demands filling. My fingers aren't enough but they're everything, pumping in and out while my thumb finds my clit and—\n\n\"AH! AH! Fuck—no—quiet—MMMM!\"\n\n[Image: I flip onto my stomach to muffle the sounds in the straw, but that just makes it worse.\n\nI flip onto my stomach to muffle the sounds in the straw, but that just makes it worse. Now I'm face down, ass up, fingering myself from behind like an animal. My tits drag through the dirt, nipples so hard they hurt, leaving trails in the dust as they swing.\n\n\"Look at that arse wobble while ye finger-fuck yerself.\"\n\nI don't care anymore. Can't care. My fingers slam deeper, faster, three now, stretching that virgin hole while my other hand reaches beneath to attack my clit. The dual sensation is too much—sparks shooting up my spine, thighs shaking, pussy clenching rhythmically around my fingers.\n\nThe pressure builds in my belly. I try to fight it, try to think of my old life, of being Aldric, of... El- Elise? Elane? But all that comes to mind is—\n\nSnib's cock. Purple head. The weight of it in my throat. The taste when he—\n\n\"No no no not that—\"\n\nBut my pussy clenches harder thinking about it. About how his cum feels sliding down my throat. How his balls smell pressed against my nose. How it feels when he floods my mouth and I swallow every—\n\n\"Gonna—fuck—gonna—\"\n\nMy fingers curl, finding that spot again, and my thumb presses hard on my clit and—\n\nThe first squirt surprises me. A sudden gush of clear fluid that sprays from my cunt, splattering my hand, my thighs, the straw. My pussy convulses around my fingers so hard it almost pushes them out.\n\n\"AHHHHHHNNNNGGGG!\"\n\nThe second squirt is bigger. Longer. I can feel it building in my belly and rushing out like pissing but different, better, shameful. My whole body locks up, back arched, as stream after stream gushes from my virgin cunt.\n\n\"FUCK! FUCK! CAN'T—CAN'T STOP—AHHHH!\"\n\nI'm squealing now, high-pitched and desperate, as my pussy explodes again and again. Each convulsion sends another jet of girl-cum spraying, until I'm kneeling in a puddle of my own shame. My fingers won't stop moving, drawing out more squirts, more gushes, like my body is trying to empty itself completely.\n\n[Image: 'FUCK! FUCK! CAN'T—CAN'T STOP—AHHHH!'\n\nI collapse forward but my pussy isn't done. Smaller spurts now, little gushes with each aftershock. My whole body is shaking, twitching, covered in sweat and cum and my own squirt. The straw beneath me is soaked through, mud-wet with pussy juice.\n\n\"Please—can't—still cumming—\"\n\nOne final massive gush, this one so hard it hurts, spraying between my fingers. Then I'm done, collapsed in my own puddle, fingers still buried in my twitching cunt, feeling the walls pulse and grip at nothing.\n\n\"Squirted out what was left of Aldric,\" Snib observes. \"Just Elise now. Elise who fingers herself raw thinkin' about gobbo cock.\"\n\n[Image: 'Squirted out what was left of Aldric,' Snib observes.\n\nThe shame crashes down as the pleasure fades. I'm lying in at least a pint of my own pussy juice, the whole hut reeking of desperate virgin cunt finally touched. My fingers are pruned from the wetness. My pussy still twitches, little aftershock clenches that release more drools of fluid.\n\n\"Sleep in it,\" he commands. \"Let that cunt-puddle soak into yer skin.\"\n\nI do. I curl up right there in my squirt-soaked straw, pussy still pulsing, still drooling, knowing I just came thinking about the very creature that's destroying me. My brain feels actually broken, thoughts scattered like my squirt across the floor.\n\n[Choice: The rest of the days are a blur...]\n\nMy hand jerks back like I've touched fire.\n\n\"NO!\" The word tears from my throat, desperate. \"I'm not—I'm ALDRIC—\"\n\nBut the name feels wrong in my mouth. Aldric. Was that me? The hero who killed... who killed...\n\nGorthak. Scarred face, drove my blade through his throat.\nSnaggle. The drummer, head caved in with my shield.\nPustule. Burned alive with Ignisurge.\n\nI can see their faces perfectly. Every goblin I've killed, catalogued in crystal clarity. But my own name? My own FACE?\n\n\"Can't remember, can ye?\" Snib chuckles. \"All them loads coating yer throat. Seepin' into yer brain-meat.\"\n\nThe cum. His fucking CUM. Every morning, pumped directly into my stomach. The fumes from cleaning his loincloths. The taste that never leaves. It's... it's erasing me. Replacing memories with the taste of cock, the smell of balls, the weight of—\n\n\"Elara!\" I sob her name like a prayer. \"Red hair—no, brown—AUBURN! She has auburn hair and... and...\"\n\nHer face swims up through the fog. Pale skin. Laughing eyes. The way she looked this morning when—\n\n[Image: This morning? Which morning? How many days have passed?\nThis morning? Which morning? How many days have passed? Time has become measured in cock-suckings, in loads swallowed, in—\n\n\"I saved villages,\" I whisper to the dark, curling into a ball, hands clenched to keep them from wandering. \"I killed the basilisk. I studied at the Tower. I have a wife who—who loves—loved—loves me.\"\n\nMy pussy clenches, empty, aching, demanding attention. The wetness pools beneath me, soaking into my skin. But I won't touch it. Won't give in. That's the last boundary. The final line between who I was and what he wants me to become.\n\n\"Aldric wore armor,\" I recite through tears. \"Aldric wielded Whisperwind. Aldric had a cock—\"\n\nThe absence between my legs throbs harder at the word.\n\n\"Aldric loved Elara. Aldric protected people. Aldric was good. Aldric was—IS—\"\n\n\"Was,\" Snib corrects. \"Now there's just Elise with the drippy cunt, too proud to finger herself.\"\n\nI sob harder, but I don't touch myself. That's my victory. Small, pathetic, but mine. My pussy screams for attention, clenches on nothing, drools its need into the straw. But my hands stay clenched, nails digging into palms.\n\n\"I'll remember,\" I promise the darkness. \"I'll remember who I was. Am. Was. Fuck.\"\n\nSleep comes eventually, fitful and wrong.\n\n*Elara's kneeling in our bedroom but her face is... wrong. Glazed. White ropes of cum paint her features like a festival mask. Her eyes are vacant, staring at nothing while her mouth hangs open, more cum drooling from her lips.*\n\n*\"Honey?\" I reach for her but my hand is small, feminine, wrong.*\n\n*She turns to me. Through the glaze of goblin seed, she smiles.*\n\n*\"Who?\" she asks, voice thick with cum. \"Sorry, I don't... everything before Master is fuzzy.\"*\n\n*\"It's me! Your husband! Aldric!\"*\n\n*\"Aldric's dead.\" She says it simply, cum bubbling from her lips as she speaks. \"Master Snib said so. Said he turned into some cow-titted thing. But that's probably just stories.\"*\n\n*\"No! Look at me! I'm here! I'm—\"*\n\n*But she's already turning away, hands moving to her swollen belly. Green hands push from inside, stretching her skin.*\n\n*\"Time to birth more,\" she says dreamily. \"Master needs soldiers.\"*\n\n*The green hands tear through—*\n\nI wake, my pussy gushing clear fluid despite never being touched. Just from the nightmare. Just from the image of her face painted with—\n\n\"'Nother bad dream?\" Snib asks, amused.\n\nI curl tighter, hands still clenched, pussy still drooling, and whisper:\n\nPheromone corruption has completely altered the way you think...\"My name is Aldric. My wife is Elara. My sword is Whisperwind. My name is Aldric. My wife is...\"\n\n[Choice: Perform your morning duties...]",

      "text": "\"That's enough ball-cleanin'. Let's see how deep ye can really go.\"\n\nHe's standing, cock at full mast, purple head weeping its morning dew. I'm on my knees—always on my knees now—looking up at twelve inches of green-and-purple morning wood.\n\n\"Open up, Gullet.\"\n\nMy mouth opens. Automatic. Like yawning.\n\nHe slides in slow, watching my lips stretch around his girth. Four inches. Five. Six. The head hits my throat entrance and he pauses.\n\n\"Swallow.\"\n\nI swallow. The head pops through. Seven inches. Eight.\n\n\"Good. Now the hard part.\"\n\nHe grips my hair with both hands and pulls me forward. Nine inches. Ten. My nose is approaching his pelvis, that jungle of wiry hair that reeks of concentrated ball-sweat. Eleven inches. My throat bulges visibly, his cock outline clear through my neck.\n\n\"One more—\"\n\nTwelve. My nose buries in his pubes. His balls rest on my chin, heavy and churning. I can't breathe. Can't think. Can only feel the massive invasion reshaping my throat.\n\n\"Now stay.\"\n\nStay? I'm suffocating, vision going sparkly at the edges, but he holds me there. Five seconds. Ten. My throat convulses around him, trying to expel or swallow, it doesn't know which.\n\n\"*Grulkaz-neth*,\" he grunts. \"That's 'good depth' in Gobbo. Say it.\"\n\nI can't say anything with twelve inches of cock down my throat, but I try. The vibrations of my attempted words make him groan.\n\n\"Again. *Grulkaz-neth*.\"\n\nMy throat works around him, trying to form the words. More vibrations. His cock swells thicker.\n\n\"That's it. Learnin' the important words.\"\n\nHe pulls out slow, letting me gasp one breath, then plunges back in. Full depth immediately. My throat accepts it easier this time—it's learning, adapting, becoming what it needs to be.\n\n\"What's yer wife's name again?\"\n\nThe question cuts through the fog. Elara. Her name is Elara. Red hair. No—brown? Auburn. She has...\n\nHe pulls out, lets me gasp.\n\n\"E... Elara...\"\n\n\"Nah, don't sound right. What color's her hair?\"\n\n\"Brown... no, red... I—\"\n\nHe shoves back in, cutting off thought. His cock pulses and the morning load begins. This time he doesn't pull out—just grinds deeper as rope after rope pumps directly into my stomach. I'm drowning in goblin seed, breathing through my nose while my throat gets painted white from the inside.\n\nWhen he finally withdraws, I collapse forward, coughing up thick pearls.\n\n\"Tomorrow we go deeper,\" he promises.\n\nThe rest of the day, I can't picture Elara's face clearly. Something about the way his cum coats my throat makes memories slippery.\n\n[Image: 'Neck-pussy.'\n\"Deeper today,\" he announces, cock already in my throat. \"Let's see what them hero-holes can really do.\"\n\nHe pushes past my gag reflex like it doesn't exist. My throat bulges obscenely, the outline of his cock visible through my neck. He traces it with one finger.\n\n\"Look at that. Can see me cock right through yer neck-pussy.\"\n\nNeck-pussy. That's new. Everything's a pussy to him now. My mouth is face-pussy. My throat is neck-pussy. My actual pussy is just \"the main hole\" which he still hasn't touched, keeping to our bargain.\n\nThe skull-fucking is methodical today. He counts the strokes.\n\n\"Twenty... twenty-one... that's it, squeeze on the upstroke... twenty-two...\"\n\nMy vision goes spotty but my throat knows its job. Squeeze, release, squeeze, release. Milking him like my hands did that first morning. My pussy—the main hole—clenches in the same rhythm, drooling steadily onto the dirt floor.\n\nWhen he cums, he's deeper than ever. The first three ropes go straight to my stomach. The rest paint my face and tits as he withdraws, but I barely notice anymore. It's just morning decoration. Part of the uniform.\n\nI clean his entire hut that day. On my knees, tits hanging, cum drying to a glaze. He watches and calls out names:\n\n\"There goes Udder-slave... now she's Mop-tits... look at them swing...\"\n\nEach name makes my pussy clench. When did humiliation become... warm?\n\n\"New game,\" Snib announces. \"Walkin' suck.\"\n\nHe stands. Points at his cock. I understand immediately, dropping to my knees and taking him in my mouth.\n\n\"Now follow. Don't let it slip out.\"\n\nHe starts walking around the hut. Slowly. I have to shuffle on my knees to keep up, his cock never leaving my mouth. It's a grotesque dance—him leading, me following, connected by twelve inches of green meat. My tits sway with each shuffle, my ass jiggles, everything in constant motion.\n\n\"Good cock-puppy. Now outside.\"\n\nOutside? But I'm naked. Have been for days now. The armor sits in the corner, untouched. When did I stop putting it on?\n\nWe tour his property like this. Him walking, commenting on the desert morning. Me shuffling behind on bloody knees, cock buried in my throat, tits dragging in the sand. Other goblins see us. Point. Laugh. One throws a rock that hits my ass, making it jiggle more.\n\n\"That's Gresh,\" Snib tells me casually. \"Lost his brother to Aldric. But look—now Aldric's suckin' me cock like a trained seal. Justice, innit?\"\n\n*Aldric.* The name feels foreign. Was that someone I knew?\n\nHis cock pulses. He floods my mouth without warning, still walking. I swallow without thinking—when did swallowing become automatic?—and keep shuffling. Cum runs from the corners of my mouth, drips onto my swinging tits, leaves a trail in the sand.\n\n\"Good drain,\" he says patting my head. \"Yer gettin' the hang of it.\"\n\n\"Ye look hungry.\"\n\nI am. So hungry. I've been cooking for him all day—desert hare with cactus fruit, seasoned with sage I found growing by the well. The smell fills the hut but he hasn't let me eat yet.\n\n\"Tell ye what. Ye can eat after ye feed me.\"\n\nI don't understand until he points at his cock.\n\n\"Protein first,\" he says, grinning.\n\nThis morning's position is almost tender. He sits on his furs, legs spread. I kneel between them, taking my time. My tongue finds every vein, every ridge. I polish the head until it gleams. My hands cup his balls, feeling them churn, imagining all that backed-up cream that needs releasing. Poor thing, carrying all that weight.\n\n\"Say it in Goblish,\" he commands.\n\n\"*Thrack-mayo,*\" I whisper. *Need-to-cum.* When did I learn that?\n\n\"Good accent. Again.\"\n\n\"*Thrack-mayo, grok-splash meta.*\" *Need-to-cum, please empty balls.*\n\nHe grunts approval. His cock swells thicker. I take it deep, deeper, deepest. My throat knows every inch now, welcomes it like a friend. The taste is familiar, comforting almost. When he floods my mouth this time, I don't pull back.\n\nThe first rope hits my throat and I swallow.\n\nNot spit. Swallow.\n\nIt goes down hot and thick, coating everything. The second rope, third, fourth—I drink them all. It pools in my stomach like molten lead, heavy and warm. When he finally stops, I'm still sucking, trying to get every drop.\n\n\"Waste not,\" I mumble around his softening cock, cum drunk. The words slur.\n\nHe laughs. Pets my hair like I'm a good dog.\n\n[Image: That night I cook wearing nothing but his dried cum.\nThat night I cook wearing nothing but his dried cum. It flakes off into the food sometimes. Extra seasoning. I serve him his portion, then kneel beside him with mine. We eat in comfortable silence. Like a married couple.\n\n\"Tomorrow's day six,\" he reminds me. \"Almost done earnin' yer freedom.\"\n\nFreedom. The word means nothing. Free to do what? Go where? To someone named... the name slips away like cum down my throat.\n\nI clean up dinner, wash his balls with a warm cloth before bed, then curl naked in my straw. My pussy aches constantly now, a hollow throb that matches my heartbeat. Sometimes I touch it, find it soaked, taste myself on my fingers. Salt and honey and shame.\n\nBut mostly I just accept it. The ache. The wetness. The constant awareness of the empty space that needs filling.\n\nTomorrow is day six.\n\nThen day seven.\n\nThen... something?\n\n\"*Grok-nash tempo.*\" *Time means nothing.*\n\nWhen did I start thinking in Goblish?\n\nSleep takes me, and I dream of nothing but the taste of morning cock, the weight of balls on my face, the warm splash of cum across my tits. Like prayer. Like purpose.\n\nLike home.\n\n[Choice: Morning 6...",

      "text": "The hunger wakes me before dawn.\n\nNot stomach-hunger. Deeper. Like my bones are hollow and only one thing can fill them. I'm crawling before I'm conscious, knees scraping across the dirt floor toward his sleeping form. My tits hang and sway, pulling at my shoulders, nipples dragging little furrows in the dust. The motion is automatic now—my body knows the path from my straw pile to his furs like a river knows its bed.\n\nHe's on his back, snoring. That beautiful morning wood standing tall—green shaft disappearing into darker foreskin that's rolled halfway back, revealing the purple crown already glazed with night-cream. The smell hits from three feet away: concentrated ball-musk mixed with that yeasty precum scent that makes my mouth flood with spit.\n\nI don't wait for permission.\n\nMy tongue finds his balls first. Heavy, hairy sacks that taste of salt and concentrated male. I lave them gentle, careful, like polishing precious stones. The left one, then the right, sucking each into my mouth to warm them with my breath. They're so full. I can feel them churning, heavy with backed-up cream that needs releasing.\n\n\"*Mmmm, thrack-mayo,*\" I whisper against the wrinkled skin. *Need to cum.* \"*Grok-splash vrex tummy.*\" *Empty balls in tummy.*\n\n\"Well well,\" his voice comes rough with sleep. \"The cock-maid's learned to wake proper.\"\n\nI'm already moving up the shaft, tongue tracing each vein like reading a map I've memorized. The foreskin rolls back fully under my attention, revealing the purple head in all its morning glory. Precum pools in the little valley beneath the crown—concentrated essence that's been fermenting all night. I slurp it up greedily, the taste exploding across my tongue. Bitter-salt-yeast-musk, coating everything, making my thoughts go soft at the edges.\n\n\"Please,\" the word comes out desperate. \"Please, Master Snib, need my morning feeding.\"\n\nMaster. When did I start saying Master?\n\n\"Hungry little Throat-cunt, ain't ye?\" He stretches, making his cock bob. Another pearl of precum forms and I catch it on my tongue before it can fall. \"What happened to the big hero who was gonna kill me?\"\n\nHero? The word means nothing. There's only this hunger, this hollow ache that starts in my throat and goes all the way down to my... to the wet place that clenches and drools between my legs.\n\n\"Please, breakfast. Need breakfast.\" I'm kissing his cock now, pressing my lips against the shaft like a lover. Each kiss leaves a mark of spit that gleams in the dawn light. \"So hungry. Please feed me.\"\n\nHe laughs, sitting up. \"Fetch a plate then. The nice one.\"\n\nThe nice one—a ceramic dish I found yesterday while cleaning, probably stolen from some merchant. I scramble for it, crawling back with it balanced on my palms, tits swaying beneath me. Place it reverently beside his furs.\n\n\"Position,\" he commands.\n\nI know what he means. On my knees, back straight, tits thrust forward. Mouth open, tongue out, eyes looking up at him with the devotion he's trained into me. The position makes everything ache—my spine from arching, my thighs from spreading, my jaw from staying open. But it also makes my pussy clench in rhythm with my heartbeat.\n\nHe stands over me, cock pointing down at the plate. Starts stroking with that lazy rhythm I've memorized. The foreskin rolls back and forth, collecting precum, releasing it. Each stroke makes a wet sound—*schlick-schlick-schlick*—that harmonizes with my panting.\n\n\"Beg proper. In Goblish.\"\n\n\"*Vrex-thrack mayo cum-feed.*\" The words pour out without thought. \"*Gulp-gulp need. Tummy empty. Throat-pussy hungry. Please please grok-splash!*\"\n\nHis balls draw up tight. Here it comes. My mouth waters so hard I drool, spit running down to drip from my nipples onto my thighs. He aims carefully at the plate and—\n\nThe pisshole dilates.\n\nI watch it open like a tiny mouth, the purple head swelling darker, almost black. Then the first rope emerges—not shoots, but EXTRUDES, like paste from a tube but chunkier. It's pearl-white with yellow streaks, maintaining its rope shape as it falls onto the plate with a wet SPLAT that makes the ceramic ring.\n\nThe second rope comes while the first is still connected—a continuous stream of custard-thick seed that coils onto itself like custard. But this has chunks. Actual clots of concentrated sperm that plop onto the growing pile. The smell hits immediate—rotted fish mixed with yeast mixed with something chemical that makes my eyes water and my pussy flood.\n\nThird rope. Fourth. Each one SPLORTS out with its own wet sound, piling higher. The cum doesn't spread—it's too thick, maintaining its shape like potter's clay. By the seventh rope there's a mountain of it, peak threatening to topple.\n\n\"*MORE!*\" I beg without thinking. \"*More grok-splash! Fill plate! Feed throat-cunt!*\"\n\nHe grunts and three more ropes emerge in quick succession—these ones clearer, more liquid, running down the sides of the cum-mountain like avalanche. The plate is invisible now, buried under what must be a full cup of goblin seed.\n\nThe final rope comes out different—almost solid, like a pearl noodle that he has to shake from his cock-tip. It drapes across the peak like a flag on a mountain, steaming in the cool morning air.\n\n\"There's breakfast,\" he says, sitting back. \"Eat up.\"\n\nMy hands shake as I lift the plate. It's warm—his cum is always fever-hot, radiating through the ceramic. The pile jiggles but doesn't slide, maintaining its architecture. I bring it close to my face and the smell makes my vision swim. This close, I can see movement in the white mass. Not swimming, but... writhing. Like the sperm are still alive, still seeking.\n\nMy tongue extends. Touches the peak.\n\nThe taste explodes through my skull—concentrated corruption that makes yesterday's load seem watered down. This is morning cum, fermented overnight in those churning balls, thick with purpose and potential. My tongue scoops up a glob and I let it sit in my mouth, feeling the texture. Custard-thick but with variety—smooth parts, chunky parts, strings that won't break when I pull my tongue back.\n\nI swallow. Feel it slide down my throat in a warm lump, coating everything, settling heavy in my stomach.\n\nAnother lick. Another swallow. I'm making sounds—desperate, hungry sounds like an animal feeding. My tongue works in circles, gathering the cum into manageable portions. Some of it strings between my mouth and the plate, refusing to break, making bridges of pearl that stretch two feet before snapping back to slap my chin.\n\n\"Look at ye,\" Snib observes. \"The great hero, eatin' gobbo cum off a plate like it's honey-cakes.\"\n\n[Image: 'The great hero, eatin' gobbo cum off a plate like it's honey-cakes.'\n\nHero. That word again. It should mean something but all I can focus on is the feast before me. I tilt the plate, letting some of the more liquid cum run toward my mouth. It pours in thick and warm, pooling under my tongue before I swallow. The chunks require chewing—actual chewing—breaking down between my teeth like curds.\n\nHalfway through, I realize I'm moaning. Low, constant sounds of satisfaction as my stomach fills with his seed. My pussy is drooling so steadily there's a puddle forming beneath me. My nipples are hard as stones, aching with each breath.\n\n\"*Good cum,*\" I mumble through a full mouth, forgetting Common tongue. \"*Good breakfast. Thank Master.*\"\n\nI lick the plate clean. Every drop, every smear. Run my finger around the edge to gather the last traces, suck it clean. When I'm done, my stomach is warm and heavy with his load. I feel it moving inside me, alive, seeking. My thoughts are completely scattered—just warmth and fullness and the lingering taste coating my mouth.\n\n\"What's yer name?\" Snib asks suddenly.\n\nI blink up at him, confused. Name?\n\n\"I... I don't...\"\n\n\"What were ye before ye came here?\"\n\nBefore? There was no before. There's only the hut, the chores, the morning feedings. Only Master's cock and the hunger for it.\n\n\"I was... hungry?\" I try.\n\nHe laughs so hard he falls back on his furs. \"Perfect. Fuckin' perfect. One more day, cow-tits. Tomorrow's day seven.\"\n\nSeven. The number should mean something. Freedom? But free from what? This is home. This is purpose. Cleaning and cooking and draining balls and—\n\n\"Time for chores,\" he says. \"That rabbit stew ye made yesterday was good. Make it again. But more sage this time.\"\n\nRabbit stew. Yes. I know that recipe. Learned it from... from...\n\nThe memory slips away like cum down my throat. Doesn't matter. I know how to make it. That's what matters.\n\nI stand on shaking legs, his cum heavy in my stomach, and go to start the day's work. My tits bounce with each step. My ass jiggles. My pussy drools. But these are just facts now, like knowing water is wet or cum is breakfast.\n\nTomorrow is day seven.\n\nI should remember why that matters.\n\nBut all I can think about is tomorrow morning's feeding, and whether Master will let me drink straight from the source this time.\n\n\"*Throat-pussy hungry always,*\" I whisper to myself in Goblish, starting the cooking fire. \"*Always hungry for Master's gift.*\"\n\n[Choice: The seventh morning...",

Give me that virgin pussy ye've been drippin' all sennight. Become proper property.\"\n\n\"But... but breakfast first?\" I'm already kissing his balls, each one getting tongue-worship like they're sacred. They taste of night-sweat and concentrated male, the flavor that means safety, home, rightness. \"*Hungry-throat needs morning cum-food please Master please.*\"\n\n\"Nah,\" he says, pulling back. \"Choice first. Freedom or fuckin'. Leave or stay. Hero or hole.\"\n\nHero. That word again. It echoes in the empty spaces where thoughts used to live. I was... someone was... there was a person who fought things? But that can't be right because I've always been here, on my knees, tits hanging, pussy drooling rivers down my thighs.\n\n\"Don't understand,\" I whimper, reaching for his cock but he slaps my hand away. \"Just need breakfast. Need *grok-splash* in tummy. Then thinking works better.\"\n\n\"No breakfast until ye choose.\" He's grinning now, those yellow eyes bright with victory already won. \"Tell me what ye want. In detail. Convince me.\"\n\nWhat I want? I want cock for breakfast, lunch, dinner. Want balls on my face while I sleep. Want cum in my hair, my throat, my womb. Want to make the nice rabbit stew with extra sage the way someone taught me—who taught me?—and serve it to Master while my pussy drips onto the floor. Want to scrub floors with my tits out, tend the desert garden with cum drying on my face, be useful, be property, be HOME.\n\n\"I...\" My voice cracks. There's something screaming in the back of my skull, some tiny thing still fighting, but it's drowning in the tide of need between my legs. \"Master, this pussy...\" I reach down, spread my lips to show him the pink, soaked inside. \"*This virgin human-cunt needs gobbo cock. Needs breeding. Needs to learn its place.*\"\n\n\"Keep going, Cunt-for-brains.\"\n\nThe nickname makes my pussy clench so hard a strand of clear fluid actually drips to the floor with an audible *plip*.\n\n\"Humans are...\" What are humans? Tall things that don't understand what holes are for. \"Humans are stupid. Build cities when they should be building nurseries for goblin babies. Have swords when they should have wombs. This cunt was confused, thought it was person, but Master taught truth. Just breeding-hole with tits attached. Just *thrack-meat* pretending to think.\"\n\n\"And what does thrack-meat want?\"\n\n\"*COCK!*\" The word tears out of me in mixed Common and Goblish. \"*Need gobbo-cock in human pussy! Need proper fucking! Need womb full of green babies!*\"\n\nI'm presenting without being asked—on all fours but chest dropped low, ass high, legs spread wide to show the soaking pink between them. The position I've seen in dreams, in the corner of my vision, in the shape of clouds. The breeding position. The surrender position. The coming home position.\n\n\"Please Master, look—*pussy talks for me!*\"\n\nAnd it does—clenching and releasing, winking at him, drooling steadily. The lips are swollen with need, darker pink from a sennight of constant arousal. My clit peeks out, hard as a pearl, begging for attention.\n\n\"*Virgin cunt worth forty gold at market,*\" I babble in Goblish, not knowing where these words come from. \"*But this cunt free for Master. Gift. Trophy. Human hero-pussy for goblin cock. Best trade ever made!*\"\n\nHe stands, cock swinging heavy. \"On yer back then. Want to watch them tits bounce when I break ye.\"\n\nI flip immediately, legs spreading wide as they can go. The spike-heels catch on the floor—when did I put them on? Have they ever been off? They frame my pussy perfectly, making my legs look longer, more fuckable. Everything about this body is designed for this moment.\n\n\"Wait,\" he says. \"Tell me yer name first.\"\n\nName? I have a name?\n\n\"I... cunt doesn't...\" I struggle, something flashing in the empty spaces. \"Elsie? Elise? No... just... just Master's property. Master's *thrack-slave*. Master's personal human cum-bucket.\"\n\n\"What about yer wife?\"\n\nWife? The word means nothing. There's only Master, only cock, only the need that's about to be filled.\n\n\"Cunts don't have wives. Cunts have Masters.\"\n\n\"Perfect.\"\n\nHe positions himself between my spread legs. His cock looks massive from this angle—twelve inches of green breeding meat topped with that purple mushroom head already leaking white tears. My pussy clenches at the sight, trying to pull him in from a distance.\n\n\"*Please,*\" I beg in pure Goblish now. \"*Empty human pussy needs goblin cum. Womb cold and lonely. Eggs getting old. Please breed please breed please fucking BREED!*\"\n\nHe presses the head against my entrance.\n\nThe first contact is electric—like two puzzle pieces finding each other after centuries apart. My pussy lips kiss his cockhead, coating it immediately in my shame-honey. He pushes slightly and they part eagerly, desperate to swallow him.\n\nOne inch.\n\n\"*OH FLUX—NO—STORAK! STORAK BLESS THIS COCK!*\"\n\nThe stretch is impossible. His cockhead is wider than anything should be, spreading virgin walls that have never known touch. But they yield—eager, grateful, reshaping themselves around him. My pussy is learning its purpose in real-time.\n\nTwo inches.\n\n\"*MORE! Pussy says MORE! Pussy says THANK YOU MORE!*\"\n\nThree inches and he hits something—my hymen, that last pretense at purity. He grins down at me.\n\n\"This is it, Slut-brain. Once I pop this, yer mine forever. No take-backs. No freedom. Just goblin cock forever.\"\n\n\"*YES! POP IT! BREAK IT! FUCKING RUIN IT!*\"\n\nHe thrusts hard.\n\n[Image: The membrane tears with a sound I swear I can hear—a wet rip that echoes through my bones.\n\nThe membrane tears with a sound I swear I can hear—a wet rip that echoes through my bones. Pain flashes then immediately becomes pleasure as his cock slides deep, deep, DEEP. Six inches. Seven. Eight.\n\n\"*FULL! PUSSY FULL! PUSSY HOME!*\"\n\nBut he keeps pushing. Nine inches and he hits my cervix, that final gate. It yields immediately, opening like it was waiting. Ten inches. Eleven.\n\nTwelve.\n\nBalls-deep in virgin pussy, his wiry pubes scratching my clit, his weight pressing me into dirt. I can feel him in my chest, in my throat, like his cock has displaced everything that used to be inside me and made room for itself.\n\n\"Look at that,\" he breathes. \"Human hero-cunt swallowing gobbo cock whole. Like ye were made for it.\"\n\n\"*WAS! Was made for Master's cock! Pussy says thank you! Womb says welcome home!*\"\n\nHe starts moving.\n\nThe first withdrawal is agony—my pussy clutches at him, trying to keep him inside. Walls that have molded to his shape collapse when empty. Then he pushes back in and they sing, reshape, remember. Out—my pussy weeps. In—my pussy rejoices.\n\n\"Gonna bounce on me now,\" he commands, pulling me up. \"Show me how bad human cunts need gobbo dick.\"\n\nHe lays back and suddenly I'm on top, his cock still buried to the balls. The position makes him feel even deeper, pressing against organs that shift to accommodate. I plant my hands on his chest and start moving.\n\nThe spike-heels help—giving me leverage to rise and fall. My tits immediately begin their dance, swinging in chaotic circles. Left-swing-up-right-down—no pattern, just flesh obeying gravity and momentum. They're so heavy they have their own rhythm, hitting their peak a heartbeat after my hips, creating this wave motion through my whole body.\n\n\"*LOOK! Look at human cow riding! Tits bouncing! Pussy gripping! This what humans are for! Not fighting—FUCKING! Not swords—COCKS!*\"\n\nI'm so wet the sounds echo off the walls—SQUELCH-PLAP-SQUELCH as I rise and fall. My pussy cream foams where we connect, white bubbles forming from the friction. His cock emerges shiny with my fluid only to disappear again, over and over, a magic trick that makes my brain melt.\n\n\"Stupid human,\" he grunts, reaching up to slap my bouncing tits. They fly sideways from the impact, swinging back to collide with each other. \"Thought ye were special. Just another cunt needin' gobbo seed.\"\n\n\"*YES! Stupid! Stupid human cunt! Should have found Master sooner! Wasted years having thoughts when should have been breeding!*\"\n\nI'm riding harder now, desperate. My thighs burn from the effort but I can't stop. Each downstroke makes his balls slap against my ass. Each upstroke makes my pussy clutch and beg. The rhythm becomes everything—bounce-squeeze-bounce-squeeze—like my heartbeat has moved to my cunt.\n\n\"All humans should be property,\" I babble, lost in the fuck. \"All human women just walking wombs. Should thank goblins for showing purpose. Should—*OH FUCK OH STORAK OH MASTER!*\"\n\n[Image: My first orgasm as property hits like a revelation.\n\nMy first orgasm as property hits like a revelation. My pussy convulses around him, squeezing in waves that start at my entrance and ripple up to my cervix. Clear fluid gushes out, soaking his balls, puddling on his thighs. I keep bouncing through it, tits slapping together, voice breaking on screams that aren't Common or Goblish but something older, more honest.\n\n\"That's one,\" he counts. \"Let's see how many before I breed ye proper.\"\n\n\"*BREED NOW! Please Master breed now! Pussy ready! Womb empty! Need goblin babies! Need Master's cum!*\"\n\nBut he just grins, grabs my hips, starts pulling me down harder on each bounce. The impacts get violent—flesh slapping flesh, his cockhead hammering my cervix, those massive balls drumming against my ass.\n\n\"Tell me what happened to the hero,\" he demands.\n\n\"*DEAD! Hero dead! Drowned in pussy juice! Only cum-slave now! Only thrack-meat! Only Master's property!*\"\n\nMy second orgasm builds before the first ends. This one's deeper, starting in my bones and spreading outward. My tits leak—actually leak, clear fluid from my nipples like my body's trying to cum from everywhere at once.\n\n\"*Human body knows truth now! Every hole wants goblin! Mouth-pussy, throat-pussy, womb-pussy, all saying YES! All saying THANK YOU! All saying MORE!*\"\n\nHis cock swells inside me. Gets impossibly thicker. His balls draw up tight against my ass.\n\n\"Here it comes, Breed-sow. Yer first proper load of gobbo cream. Ready to be a mother?\"\n\n[Choice: '*YES YES YES BREED ME BREAK ME REMAKE ME—*'",

      "text": "[Image: They even have my green eyes...\n\nThe desert hare bubbles in the pot, sage sprinkled overtop. My swollen belly presses against the rough wooden counter as I lean forward to sprinkle more herbs—the same blend I used to... to...\n\nThe memory slips away like oil through fingers. Doesn't matter. What matters is Master Snib likes his meat tender.\n\n\"Mummy! Mummy! Grotch is pullin' me hair!\"\n\n\"Now, now, little Pustule,\" I coo, not turning from the stove. \"Share nicely with your brother or there'll be no milk-sacks before bed.\"\n\n*THWAP!*\n\nSomething small and green collides with my ass, making the flesh ripple. It's Maggot, the runt, trying to climb up my leg to reach my hanging udders. Poor thing got the worst feeding spot—my left tit that produces less. The stronger boys, Grotch and Scab, have already latched onto my right, their sharp teeth clamped around my nipple as they suckle.\n\n\"There's enough booyagh milk for everyone,\" I murmur, feeling the familiar rush as my ducts open. The milk flows in spurts—I can feel it traveling from deep in my chest through the passages, erupting into their greedy mouths. Each pull makes my knees weak, sends that lovely warmth pooling between my legs.\n\n*CRASH!*\n\n\"Wart! Get off the table!\" Snib barks from his chair. \"Bad splurtling! We don't piss on furniture!\"\n\nI turn, spatula in hand, to see little Wart—only three months old but already walking—standing on our dining table with his tiny cock out, a stream of yellow arcing onto the wood I scrubbed this morning.\n\n\"Oh, Wart,\" I sigh, waddling over with Grotch and Scab still attached to my teats, their weight making my back ache. \"Daddy's right. We make skeet-ground outside, remember?\"\n\nSnib spanks the pup's bottom—not hard, just corrective. \"When ye get yer own humie breed-hole, ye can piss wherever. But this is DADDY'S home.\"\n\n\"Yes, Daddy!\" Wart squeaks, then launches himself at my left tit, fighting Maggot for position.\n\n[Image: Isn't he just adorable?\nThe sensation of four mouths on my nipples—Grotch and Scab on the right, Maggot and Wart battling over the left—makes me gasp. The milk practically GUSHES now, responding to their need. I feel it draining from the ducts, that delicious emptying sensation as they gulp and slurp.\n\n\"Good boys,\" I pant, returning to the stove on shaking legs. \"Drink up. Get big and strong so you can find girls with proper booyagh asses to breed.\"\n\nMy belly shifts—the new litter kicking. Five more splurtlings growing in my cum-tank. Master Snib made sure to womb-thrack me good last sennight when my bleeding stopped. The collar—I barely notice it anymore—warms with approval.\n\n\"Dinner's ready!\" I announce, plating Snib's portion with care. Tender meat, crisped at the edges. Just how he likes it.\n\nHe tucks in immediately, gnawing with those broken teeth. \"Good cow,\" he grunts between bites. \"Proper meal.\"\n\nI beam with pride, then sit at my place. The splurtlings know what comes next—they SQUEAL with excitement, even tiny Wart bouncing on his little legs.\n\n\"Help Mummy with her dinner!\" Snib commands, already climbing onto the table, his cock hardening.\n\nGrotch and Scab—such good strong boys—grab my cheeks from either side, their little claws digging in as they PULL my mouth wide open. I let them, tilting my head back obediently as Master Snib positions himself over my face, his balls dangling above my nose. The smell—onions and musk and HOME—fills my nostrils.\n\n\"Open wide for Daddy's nut-drain,\" he grunts, already stroking.\n\nHis cock twitches, and the first rope of ball-sludge erupts. It doesn't spray—too thick for that. Instead it EXTRUDES from his cockhole like paste from a tube, a yellowed rope of concentrated cum that drops directly onto my tongue.\n\nThe taste floods my mouth—bleach and cheese and NUTRITION. My throat works automatically, swallowing as fast as it pours out. Some misses, splattering across my cheeks, running down to pool in my swollen cleavage.\n\n\"Good Mummy!\" Pustule cheers, latching back onto my tit to feed while I feed.\n\nMore cum. Thicker now, with those cottage cheese clots I've learned to chew before swallowing. It coats my throat, fills my belly with warmth. This is my breakfast, lunch, and dinner—Master's seed-gift that keeps my milk-sacks full for the splurtlings.\n\n*GLORP-GLORP-GLORP*\n\n\"Look at Mummy eat!\" Grotch laughs, yanking my nipple so hard milk SPRAYS across the room.\n\nThe sensation—being milked while being fed—sends those wonderful sparkles through my body. My thighs start to shake. That familiar pressure builds in my breed-hole.\n\nMaster Snib finishes with a grunt, the last thick ropes draping across my face like decoration. I carefully wipe my lips with one finger, making sure to get every drop, then lower myself to hands and knees. My pregnant belly touches the floor, the splurtlings inside kicking at the pressure.\n\nThere are puddles of cum on the floor—beautiful yellow-white pools of Master's gift. I lower my head and begin lapping like the good breed-cow I am. My tongue works efficiently, gathering every precious drop while the pups dance around me, slapping my hanging udders and making them spray milk.\n\n\"SQUEEEEE!\" Wart manages to latch on from below, lying on his back and nursing while I clean.\n\nThe combination—the taste of cum, the pulling on my nipples, the weight of my bred belly—pushes me over. My breed-hole CLENCHES and—\n\n*SPLOOOOOOORT*\n\nI squirt. Hard. A massive arc of clear juice that paints the wall behind me. My whole body shakes as waves of pleasure crash through me, making my milk let down even harder. The pups SQUEAL with delight at the show.\n\n\"Dirty cow!\" Snib spanks my ass HARD, making the flesh jiggle. \"Makin' a mess when the boys already pissed everywhere!\"\n\n\"Sorry, Master!\" I gasp, still squirting in pulses. \"Just feels so booyagh when they feed!\"\n\nThe pups learn fast. Soon six little hands are spanking my ass, making it bounce and clap while I leak and spray.\n\n\"Thank you, Master,\" I pant, cum dripping from my chin, milk from my nipples, squirt from my cunt. \"Thank you for my perfect life.\"\n\nAnd I mean it.\n\nThis is where I belong.\n\n\"Grotch, sweetling, stop pulling on mama's milk-sacks so hard! You'll get your turn—\"\n\n*YANK*\n\n\"Ohhh!\"\n\nThe sound escapes me as little Grotch—barely two months old but already strong—latches onto my left nipple with teeth like broken glass. The milk RUSHES out, hot streams that make my whole breast tingle with that sweet-ache of emptying.\n\nI steady myself against the cooking pot, my swollen belly—seven months with the third litter—pressing against the mud-brick stove I built myself. Inside, desert hare sizzles with sage. The smell fills our hut with warmth.\n\n\"Pustule, darling, share with your brother—there's only two milk-sacks and six of you!\"\n\nThe runt, Scab, is trying to climb my leg to reach the right tit where his bigger brothers feed. His little claws dig into my thigh, making me gasp. Such eager little splurtlings! Always so spunk-heavy for mama's milk!\n\n*CRASH*\n\n\"WAAAAGH!\"\n\nMaggot has knocked over the water bucket again, sending it rolling across the packed-dirt floor I swept this morning. He's wrestling with his twin, Fungus, both of them squealing in that sweet baby Goblish.\n\n\"My my,\" I murmur, waddling over—my walk is different now, permanently bow-legged from all the thrakking, all the breeding. \"Master Snib, could you—?\"\n\n\"Oi! Maggot!\" Snib barks from his chair—the good one, with actual cushions I stuffed myself. \"Stop pissin' on me floor! Ye piss OUTSIDE like proper gobbo!\"\n\nI watch with such pride as Snib teaches our sons. He's wearing the new loincloth I made from stolen merchant silk—only the best for my breeding-master!\n\n\"Sorry Da!\" Maggot squeaks, then immediately goes back to fighting.\n\n*SLAP!*\n\nSnib's palm connects with my ass—so much bigger now, perfect breeding-haunches that jiggle for ages after impact. \"Gonna get yer own humie whore someday, boys! Just like yer da got the best cum-tank in Zaelasia!\"\n\n\"Yes Master,\" I say sweetly, feeling the warmth spreading from where he touched me. My pussy—my breed-hole—immediately starts drooling. It always does when he touches me. \"Dinner's almost ready. Boys, please help set daddy's place!\"\n\nThe chaos is immediate. Grotch releases my nipple with a wet POP, milk still dripping from his green lips, and races to grab plates. Pustule climbs the shelves, knocking things over. Scab tries to carry a fork twice his size.\n\nI plate Snib's meal with care—the best cuts of hare, seasoned just right. My swollen tits swing heavily as I lean over, milk dripping steadily onto the floor. The splurtlings immediately start lapping it up like puppies.\n\n\"Here you are, Master,\" I say, setting it before him. \"Meat first, then mama gets her meal-feeding.\"\n\n\"Good cow,\" he says, already tearing into the hare.\n\nI lower myself carefully onto the bench—my belly makes everything difficult now. The babies inside kick constantly, eager to join their brothers. Soon I'll have nine mouths on my milk-sacks! Such blessing!\n\n\"Tell us about the hero again, Da!\" Grotch demands, climbing onto the table.\n\n\"Which one? The one whose wife I'm gonna thrack next?\" Snib grins, juice running down his chin.\n\n\"The one with the silly name! Al... Al-something!\"\n\n\"Aldric!\" Snib laughs. \"Aldric the Great! Thought he was so strong, but came like a bitch first time he got proper gobbo cock!\"\n\nSomething... something flutters in my chest. Like remembering a dream. Aldric... why does that name make me feel...\n\n\"When you gonna breed-stuff his wife, Da?\" Pustule asks.\n\n\"Soon as this one,\" Snib points at me, \"pops out the next litter. Gonna make that Elara squirt even harder than—\"\n\n\"Elara?\" The name falls from my lips before I can stop it. Red hair. Laughter. A kitchen that smelled like... like sage and...\n\n\"Yeah, his wife. Pretty thing, red hair. Gonna look good with green babies in her.\"\n\nI find myself crying. Sweet tears of... of something. \"Poor Aldric,\" I sob. \"He killed so many goblins. So terrible. Look at all these sweet boys named after the ones he murdered!\"\n\n\"MAMA'S CRYING!\" Scab announces.\n\n\"Happy tears, sweetling,\" I assure him, wiping my face. \"Now, who wants to help mama with her meal-feeding?\"\n\n\"ME! ME! ME!\"\n\nSix little voices chorus as I position myself on my knees. The familiar position—ass up, face down, ready for feeding. My pregnant belly presses against the floor, the babies inside responding to their brothers' excitement.\n\n\"Hold her mouth open, boys,\" Snib instructs, standing on the table.\n\nGrotch and Pustule each grab one of my cheeks, their little fingers surprisingly strong as they pull my mouth wide. I see Master's beautiful cock—thick as my wrist, purple-headed, already drooling that wonderful cream that keeps me alive.\n\n\"Say ahhh, mama!\" Fungus giggles.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhh—\"\n\n*SPLORTCH*\n\nThe first rope of cum spurts directly onto my tongue. Thick, chunky, tasting of bleach and rot and HOME. My eyes roll back as I swallow, feeling it slide down my throat like warm porridge. But Master's spurting faster than I can swallow—\n\n*GLORP-GLORP-GLORP*\n\n\"MAMA'S MAKING A MESS!\" Maggot laughs, pointing at the cum pooling on the floor.\n\nMore spurts—lazy, thick, endless. Each one makes my womb clench, makes my milk-sacks produce more. I can feel them filling even as the boys tug and suck, the cycle of nourishment. Master's seed becomes my milk becomes their strength.\n\n\"Get it all, cow,\" Snib grunts, his balls pulsing. \"Every drop of daddy's ball-sludge!\"\n\nI try, but there's so much! It runs down my tits, pools on my pregnant belly, drips between my legs. The smell—that wonderful smell of breeding and ownership—fills my nose.\n\n\"Look! Mama's breed-hole is drooling!\" Scab points at my pussy, which is indeed gushing clear fluid.\n\n\"Means she's happy!\" Grotch explains with authority.\n\nFinally, Master stops spurting. I carefully lick my lips, gathering every precious drop, then lower myself further—face to the floor, ass high—and begin lapping the puddles like a dog.\n\n\"Good mama!\" Pustule pats my head. \"Cleaning up!\"\n\nThe taste on the floor is mixed with dirt but I don't care. Each swallow makes my pussy clench, makes my milk flow harder. The boys are all over me now—hanging from my tits, slapping them to make them swing, squealing with glee as milk sprays everywhere.\n\n\"She's gonna—look! MAMA'S GONNA SQUIRT!\"\n\nThey know the signs. My thighs shaking. My breath coming in gasps. That special moan that means—\n\n\"HNNNNNGGAAAHHH!\"\n\n*SPLOOOOOOOSH*\n\nI cum so hard my vision whites out. Pussy-juice ERUPTS from my breed-hole, spraying backward in massive arcs. It splatters the wall, the floor, makes obscene puddles that mix with the cum I'm still licking.\n\n\"MAMA MADE A MESS!\" they all scream in delight.\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nSnib's palm on my ass. \"Dirty cow! Squirtin' all over me clean floor!\"\n\n*CRACK! CRACK!*\n\n\"Yeah! Dirty mama!\" Grotch adds his little hand. *slap!*\n\nThen they're all doing it—six pairs of little hands spanking my massive ass as I cum and cum and cum, still licking Master's seed from the floor, still feeding milk to whoever latches on.\n\n\"Such a good life,\" I gasp between licks. \"Such good boys. Such a strong master. So much booyagh in my belly!\"\n\n\"Tell us about the hero again!\" Scab demands, now hanging from my left tit like a fruit.\n\n\"The one who thought he was strong!\" Snib laughs, watching me clean his cum from the floor. \"Tomorrow I'll tell ye how he begged. How he cried. How he came on gobbo cock like the bitch he always was!\"\n\nI don't know why, but something deep inside me sobs at that. Happy tears. They must be happy tears.\n\nAfter all, I love my life.\n\nDon't I?]Three months. Or is it four? Numbers stopped mattering when my belly started swelling again\n\nI waddle around the hut, the weight of triplets making every step an effort. My tits—Storak's blessing, they're magnificent now—leak constantly through the rough cloth I sometimes remember to wrap them in. Two goblin pups suckle as I work, their green hands kneading the flesh while their sharp teeth worry my nipples raw. My firstborn. Master's proudest achievement.\n\n\"More sage in the stew, Milk-sow,\" Master calls from his furs where he's counting coins. Business has been good since word spread that he has a trained human breeder. Heroes come to rescue me sometimes. I help Master set the traps.\n\n\"*Yes Master, sage makes good flavor for strong goblin boys,*\" I chirp in the pidgin of Common and Goblish that's all I speak now. The pups detach with wet pops, milk dripping from their green chins, and I feel the third one in my belly kick. Always kicking. Always hungry like their father.\n\n\"That last hero, the woman with the sword...\" Master grins. \"She's adjusting well. Reminds me of someone.\"\n\n\"*All humans same,*\" I giggle, stirring the pot with one hand while the other holds my massive belly. \"*Think they special. Then learn they just holes with attitudes.*\"\n\nHe bought me a name last month at the desert market. Elise. It's burned into a leather collar I wear above the iron one. He says I earned it by birthing so well. I cried with joy when he put it on me. A name. A real name. More than property deserves.\n\nI waddle over to him, belly leading, and drop to my knees. It takes effort with all this extra weight. My pussy—still hungry even stretched from birthing—drools onto the floor. Always wet now. Master says it's because my body knows its purpose.\n\n\"*Master so smart. Soon have two breeders. Make lots of gold. Lots of babies.*\"\n\n\"Yeah. Though you're still me favorite, Cunt-for-brains.\"\n\nThe name makes me glow with pride. I lean forward to nuzzle his cock through his loincloth—already hard from watching me waddle around leaking milk and babies. This is happiness. This is home. This is all there ever was or needs to be.\n\n\"*Thank Master for life. Thank Master for purpose. Thank Master for babies.*\"\n\n\"Thank me with that throat later. After the new girl watches. Good for her education.\"\n\n\"*Yes Master. Throat-pussy always ready. Always hungry.*\"\n\nI go back to cooking, pups reattached to my udders, triplets kicking in my womb, pussy dripping its constant need. Outside, I hear chains rattling. The new girl. She'll learn. They always do. Heroes just need proper teaching.\n\nThe stew smells perfect—rabbit with sage, just like someone once taught me to make.\n\nSomeone whose name I'll never remember again.",

My tits, crushed all night in these metal triangles, **LURCH** forward with such violence they nearly escape their prison, nipples scraping raw against the scales.\n\n**SMACK!**\n\n\"Wakey-wakey, jiggle-meat!\"\n\nAnother blow lands on my other cheek. The soft flesh—*why is there so much of it*—ripples in waves I can FEEL, the impact traveling through fat I shouldn't have, making the metal thong **CHING** as it saws deeper between my cheeks.\n\nI'm on my side in putrid straw, these massive udders stacked like sacks of grain, the bottom one completely numb from being crushed all night. My calves are locked in permanent cramps from the heel-boots, my spine twisted from trying to find ANY position where the armor doesn't cut into me, and this little green *shit* is drumming my ass like festival drums.\n\n**WHAP!

Open palm across both cheeks at once, hard enough that my hips buck forward involuntarily, the thong sliding against—against—\n\n\"GNAAAAHHH!\" Another pathetic squeal as I try to roll away, but there's nowhere to go. These tits throw off my balance, flopping like fresh-caught fish, and my legs are tangled in the chain connected to my collar.\n\n\"Listen to them sounds!\" He's delighted, grabbing a handful of my ass—his whole hand barely covers half of one cheek. \"All high and squeaky! Where's that big deep hero voice, eh? Left it in yer cock?\"\n\nThe morning light streaming through the cracks shows everything. How I'm sprawled in straw that reeks of piss. How my black hair is matted with sweat and hay. How my ass is already turning red from his assault, the flesh jiggling with my panicked breathing.\n\nElara's waking up alone right now. Rolling over to find my side of the bed empty and cold. While I'm here getting my ass beaten by a creature I've killed hundreds of—\n\n**SLAP!**\n\n\"Got housework fer ye today!\" He announces, giving my reddened cheek a squeeze that makes me whimper. \"Gonna make me home sparkle! Scrubbin' floors, washin' me clothes, organizin' me trophies proper-like!\"\n\nReality crashes back like ice-water.\n\n\"An' ye're gonna do it with the RIGHT ATTITUDE!\" **SPANK!** \"Gonna smile!\" **SPANK!** \"Gonna shake them tits while ye work!\" **SPANK!** \"Gonna thank Master Snib fer the privilege!\"\n\nEach impact makes the armor jingle—scale against scale, chain against chain, metal against soft flesh that bounces and ripples in ways that make my stomach turn. I'm making sounds I've never made—yelps and squeaks and breathless little \"ah! ah! ah!\"s that would shame a brothel whore.\n\n\"Say 'Yes, Master Snib!'\"",

      "text": "--- Chapter 3: Domesticated ---\n\nCrisp dawn filters through the chinks in the shabby hut, assaulting my senses as sleep refuses to release me from its comforting grip. A bird's call echoes in the near distance, a shrill warning bouncing off the silent desolation. The land of Sandwalkers, making the most of the early morning quiet, casts a gloom over my waking moments.\n\nIt's cold. Even the desert freezes toward daybreak, the bitter nip of the air making goosebumps pop on my bare skin. My nipples harden, their peak tracing against my upper arm held tight against myself. A sharp sting yanks me rudely back into wakefulness, ripping sleep's comforting shroud away.\n\n*THWACK!*)\n\nA profound sting jolts me from my drowsiness as Snib's coarse hand lands heavily on my fat butt with a brutal spank.\n\n\"Wakey, wakey, tits! Yer looking pretty damn uncomfortable in that tin can!\"\n\nI curl up instinctively, trying to shield myself from further assault.\n\n\"Git movin'! And it ain't healthy to sleep all kitted up like that,\" Snib grunts as he kicks the chain connected to the collar around my neck. It rattles loudly, the sound harsh and grating against the morning quiet.\n\nGroggily, I push against the floor, my arms quivering under the weight of my encased tits.\n\nA large, rough hand collides with my naked exposed buttock. The sharp sting radiates from my soft globes, turning my cheeks a fierce red as the cool air assaults the sensitive skin. My legs curl tighter against my chest as I yelp into my balled fist. Leaving an imprint of Snib's crude, gnarled hand on my round, delicate asset. A harsh contrast of my humiliation.\n\nA chain rattles close by, reminding me of the cold, rough collar around my neck - Snib's favorite toy. The noise of the forged iron speaks volumes of my debasement. The raw intimacy of my nudity, shadowed by Snib's perverse amusement, fills me with an unbearable loathing. My shift in personality - from hero to slave - is an ugly realization that hasn’t sunk in yet.\n\n\"Git up, cumdump! Got a long day 'ead of ya!\" Snib's grating voice barks.\n\nGroaning, I push myself upright, the metal of the collar digging into the tender skin of my throat, the chain brushes against the roundness of my large breasts. The heavy globes jiggle every time I move, amplifying the sense of strange unfamiliarity. I try to hold my chest, my hands sinking into the soft flesh - a fresh wave of humiliation crashes through me.\n\nI suppose Snib’s definition of 'feast for the eyes' now embodies the sexually provocative sight of my bare body struggling to get up. The mossy green eyes, which used to flare with courage, now tear up a bit as Snib laughs and throws something cold and metallic at me.\n\nHis sick laughter echoes around the hut as I catch the offending object. It's the armor, the disgraceful, scanty **plate-harness**. Instinctively, I attempt to cover my voluptuous nakedness with it.\n\nThe coldness of the metal feels unsettling against my skin as I fumble with the **scale-cups**. I'm not sure where to place my hands. My fingers tremble as I try to fit the tiny, metallic cups over my resplendent tits. I squirm and wriggle, trying to wrestle my breasts into the restrictive piece. It barely encases them, miniature shields futilely attempting to cover the massive territory of my tits.\n\nAs I finally clasp the hooks behind, I feel the weight of my bosom straining against the insufficient support. It's fascinatingly painful - the cold, hard metal cutting into the tender underside of my boobs, leaving them bulging out from all sides. The already limited coverage diminishes further as my hard nipples scrape against the cold steel - another grim reminder of my altered biology.\n\nNext comes the **loin-chain**. The metallic piece is embarrassing in its minimalism - just a small front plate attached to a string. But then, when has anything about this entire ordeal been becoming... or comfortable?\n\nI step into it and pull it up. It’s a battle of its own - the tight string embracing my full buttocks, the small metal plate barely covering the front. My mound is shaved barren, the slick folds of my new pussy exposed to the cool desert breeze tickling it's way into the hut.\n\nThe high metallic waist pinches into my flesh, amplifying my curvaceous shape and accentuating the part of me I'd much rather conceal. I feel exposed, cold, and stark naked, even though now technically armored.\n\nThe high heels make my feet wobble. My once sturdy footing replaced by an undignified totter. The devil's own geometry between rib and flank amplified grotesquely by the added height, forcing me to sway my hips—an unwanted alluring image.\n\nDrawing in a shuddering breath, I pull myself to a stand, waiting for the next cruel demand from my tormentor. Underneath the hard metal pressing into my soft flesh, my heart pounds a melancholy rhythm. Is this to be my life - cruel awakenings and humiliating garb?",

I walk through grain that reaches my waist—not wheat but something silken, each stalk whispering as I pass. My hands are calloused. My shoulders broad. My cock swings heavy between my thighs with each stride.\n\nThank the Ephemerals. I'm myself again. It was all just a bad dream!\n\nThe festival torches paint everything in amber and shadow. Ahead, the villagers work the harvest in the old way—women in loose linen dresses binding sheaves, their movements graceful as temple dancers. I recognize them: Mira the seamstress, her dark hair escaping its braid. Petra the cooper's daughter, freckled and full-lipped. The widow Ashara, still young enough that men watch when she bends.\n\nThey're all watching me now.\n\n\"Aldric!\" Mira calls, straightening. The motion makes her breasts shift under thin fabric. No bindings underneath—harvest tradition, something about Flux blessing the fertile. \"You're late for the reaping!\"\n\n\"Overslept,\" I say, and my voice is deep, RIGHT. Male thunder that doesn't catch or lilt.\n\nPetra giggles, eyes traveling down my body with an openness that makes heat crawl up my neck. \"Clearly. Did you forget your tunic?\"\n\nI look down. I'm naked. Completely. My cock thick and heavy, balls hanging low in the warm night. But no one seems scandalized—just amused. Ashara winks.\n\n\"It's Verge's night,\" she says, reaching down to adjust her neckline. The movement is casual, but it exposes the upper curve of one breast, pale as cream. \"Thresholds require nakedness. Didn't the priests teach you anything?\"\n\nThe other women laugh—not cruel, just merry. Harvest laughter. Safe laughter. The kind that makes you feel included rather than mocked.\n\n\"Here.\" Mira tosses me something that glints in the moonlight. I catch it one-handed—Whisperwind, except curved like a reaping hook. The blade sings when I swing it experimentally, the familiar weight settling into my palm like a lover's hand.\n\n\"Let's see what the hero can harvest,\" Petra says, and there's something in her voice that makes my cock twitch despite myself.\n\nThe grain isn't wheat. Up close, I see each stalk is actually hair—long, black, silk-soft. It grows from the earth in impossible profusion, each strand thick as yarn, swaying in wind that doesn't exist. When I reach down to touch it, the hair wraps around my fingers like it's alive.\n\n\"Don't be shy,\" Ashara calls. She's stripped her dress to the waist now, breasts bare and heavy, nipples dark in the moonlight. \"Cut deep!\"\n\nI swing. The blade—my blade—parts the hair-grain in a clean arc. The severed strands fall like water, and where they hit earth they BLOOM into more growth, spreading outward in ripples.\n\nBehind the cut, I see my reflection in a standing mirror I didn't notice before. The glass is old, warped, but clear enough. I watch myself swing again—bare-chested, muscled, cock and balls on full display. This is who I am. This is—\n\nThe blade bites into the mirror.\n\nGlass cracks. But instead of shards, thick white fluid wells from the split, running down in heavy streams that steam in the cool air. Milk. The mirror is bleeding MILK.\n\n\"Perfect!\" Mira claps her hands. \"Your first harvest!\"\n\nThe women converge, carrying buckets, collecting the milk-blood. They're all topless now, I realize. All of them bare-breasted, their tits swaying as they work. Mira's are small and high, nipples like rose petals. Petra's hang heavier, bouncing with each movement. Ashara's stretch down past her ribs, aureoles wide as my palm, dripping.\n\nDripping?\n\n\"Like this,\" Ashara says, stepping close. She cups her right breast—both hands needed for its weight—and squeezes. A thick stream of white arcs out, splashing into the furrow at our feet. \"See? Easy.\"\n\n\"The moon teaches all women,\" Mira says, nodding up at the sky.\n\nI follow her gaze.\n\nThe moon isn't right. It hangs too low, close enough to touch if I could reach high enough. And it's swollen—grotesquely, obscenely swollen, stretched tight like a breast ready to burst. I can see veins crawling across its surface, pulsing with dim light. The craters aren't craters but aureoles, and from the dark spot at its center—\n\nMilk begins to rain.\n\nWarm. White. Thick enough to mat in my hair, run down my face, coat my shoulders. The women laugh and spin in it, tilting their faces up, opening their mouths. It soaks their dresses transparent, clings to their skin.\n\nSome of it runs down my chest. Where it touches, my skin tingles. Burns. Changes.\n\n\"Don't fight it,\" a voice says behind me.\n\nElara.\n\n[Image: She stands at the field's edge in a harvest dress—golden fabric that clings to curves more pronounced than I remember.\nShe stands at the field's edge in a harvest dress—golden fabric that clings to curves more pronounced than I remember. Her belly swells round with child, so large she has to lean back slightly. Her breasts have doubled, tripled, straining the neckline until it gaps. Red hair cascades over bare shoulders.\n\n\"My love,\" I say, relief flooding through me. \"I had the strangest dream. I thought I'd become—\"\n\n\"Shh.\" She smiles, beautiful and serene, one hand cupping the underside of her gravid belly. \"Come. Let me show you something.\"\n\nI follow her toward the barn. The other women watch us pass, their hands still working their own breasts, milk splashing into the furrows. The grain-hair grows taller from the feeding, reaching toward the lactating moon.\n\nInside the barn, the smell hits first—sweet hay and warm bodies and something musky underneath. Elara turns to face me, that smile still fixed in place. Moonlight through the slats paints bars across her body.\n\n\"Kiss me,\" she says, lips parting.\n\nI lean in. Her mouth opens wider. Wider. Her jaw hinges impossibly, and from the darkness of her throat crawls—\n\nSnib.\n\nWet and grinning, no bigger than a rat, scrabbling up her tongue and onto her teeth. \"Surprise, hero!\" His voice echoes from inside her. \"Told ye I'd visit the wife!\"\n\nI stumble back, horror washing through me. But Elara just laughs—her laugh, but doubled, harmonized with Snib's cackling. She reaches up and grabs her own breasts, squeezing them like Ashara showed. But instead of milk, thick ropes of something yellower, chunkier, spray out.\n\nThe barn walls are bleeding it too. Every wooden slat weeps goblin seed in viscous sheets.\n\nI look down at my own chest.\n\nTwo mounds push out from my pectorals, swelling like bread dough. My nipples darken, spread, pucker outward. The weight grows, pulls. I cup them instinctively and they fill my palms, keep filling, spilling over. Heavy as grain sacks. Soft as fresh butter.\n\n\"There we are,\" Elara coos. Snib crawls onto her shoulder, both of them watching me with matching yellow eyes. \"Now you can help feed them.\"\n\nThe floor splits open. From the cracks, goblin babies sprout like turnips—green and squalling, reaching up with grasping hands. Dozens. Hundreds. The barn fills with their chittering hunger.\n\nElara kneels gracefully despite her belly, lifts one to her breast. It latches on, suckling greedily. She looks at me with those wrong eyes. \"Your turn, *dear*. Don't let them starve.\"\n\nThe babies surge toward me. Clambering up my legs, reaching for my chest—for my TITS—with wet, toothless mouths. The weight of them pulls me down. I fall to my knees in the hay, my new breasts swaying forward, and—\n\nSomething grabs my ass. Hard. Spanks it with a crack that echoes through the barn.\n\n\"Wakey, wakey—\"\n\n*THWACK!*\n\nCold air slaps my face. My eyes snap open to dingy mud-brick walls. Hay poking into soft skin. And Snib's warty hand raised for another strike.\n\n*THWACK!*\n\n\"—tits! Time fer yer first day of service!\" and )The temple vaults rise in familiar geometry—stone ribs holding up painted heavens. I kneel before Eon's altar in full ceremonial plate, the weight of it a comfort. This is the Blessing of Blades, the ritual my mother told me about. Every knight must present their sword to the Triad before it drinks its first blood.\n\nWhisperwind rests across my gauntlets. The blade catches candlelight, throws it back pure and hungry.\n\nThe priest approaches—except his robes hang wrong on his frame, too long, dragging in pooled wax. His face hides in shadow beneath his cowl. Good. Proper. The Ephemerals' servants walk veiled during consecrations.\n\n\"You come seeking blessing,\" he says, but the voice grates like stone on stone.\n\n\"I do.\" My own voice echoes. Strong. Male. Right.\n\n\"Then receive.\"\n\nMore priests emerge from shadow—dozens of them in golden vestments, but their faces are Snib's. All Snib. Yellow eyes and broken teeth, chanting:\n\n*\"What was sword shall be sheath. What was, is, will be—breeding. Through Eon's memory, through Flux's turning, through Verge's door—\"*\n\nThey lift Whisperwind from my hands. I try to protest but my voice won't come. The lead priest-Snib raises a golden chalice over my blade.\n\n\"By the Three Paths, we consecrate this steel—\"\n\nThe \"oil\" pours out thick as porridge, yellow-white with chunks. The stench makes my eyes water as it splashes across Whisperwind's fuller. But instead of running off, the blade *drinks* it, the metal darkening from silver to diseased bronze, pulsing like a throat swallowing.\n\nMy armor begins to burn. Not hot—wet heat, like being digested. The breastplate softens, pressing inward, but also pushing OUT from inside. Two mounds rise from my chest, the metal flowing like mercury to accommodate them, reshaping into triangular cups that barely contain the swelling flesh.\n\nI turn—hundreds of women, all with my face but Elise's body, bellies swollen to bursting. They're touching themselves through armor exactly like what mine is becoming, their voices Elara's but the words wrong:\n\n*\"He was, he's not, he'll never be again. Through the womb-door. Through the breeding-threshold. Remake him, blessed Snib—\"*\n\nMy codpiece cracks. Falls. There's nothing there. Smooth. Empty. A vertical slit opening like a mouth, already wet.\n\nThe altar-cunt DILATES. Inside, I see Whisperwind being pulled through, transformed—the blade shortening, handle thickening into something obscene. The priest-Snibs press their warty hands to my armor, kneading my body like dough underneath. My waist narrows. Hips widen. The metal flows and reshapes, each piece smaller, revealing more flesh that shouldn't exist.\n\n\"The Cathedral is Mother,\" they chant. \"And Mother births what Master needs—\"\n\nThe walls contract. The ceiling-cervix opens wider. We're inside something living, something that's digesting my knighthood and shitting out—\n\nThe lead priest raises his hand to strike the final blessing across my ass—\n\n**THWACK!**\n\nI jerk awake, the dream-cathedral collapsing into Snib's shit-stinking hut. His hand just left my ass, the sting radiating through soft flesh I shouldn't have.\n\n\"Wakey-wakey, tit-slave! Sun's up!\")[[Image: The Grand Drilling Yards of Thuulk stretch before me like a chessboard of polished granite.\n\nThe Grand Drilling Yards of Thuulk stretch before me like a chessboard of polished granite, each square large enough to hold a century of men. Bronze braziers taller than horses burn at the corners, their smoke carrying the sharp bite of sanctified oils—the same blessing-reek we paint on shields before marching to Sirath's bloody shores.\n\n\"SEVENTH LEGION!\" My voice carries across the thousand men arrayed before me. \"PRESENT... ARMS!\"\n\nThe crash of steel echoes off the palace walls as weapons snap to salute position. Perfect. These boys will be ready for the spring offensive. The green recruits from the provinces, the grizzled sergeants who've survived three tours across the sea, the eager squires who think war is glory—I've forged them all into killing instruments.\n\nI stride the first rank, checking blade angles, shield positions, the set of shoulders. My armor feels... light today. Must be the new padding the quartermaster issued. These men need to see strength, need to believe their battlemage commander can lead them through Sirath's meat grinder and bring them home.\n\n\"You there, Recruit!\" I bark at a fresh-faced boy, barely sixteen. \"State your **First Oath** when facing Sirathi pike formations!\"\n\n\"Sir! Maintain shield-wall integrity while the second rank probes for—\"\n\nHe stops. His eyes have dropped to my chest.\n\nI look down. My breastplate has... changed. The hammered steel curves outward in two massive swells, the metal thinning to triangular scales that barely contain—\n\n\"Eyes FORWARD, soldier!\" But my voice comes out wrong. Higher. Breathier. Like I'm trying to seduce rather than command.\n\nThe recruit is ME. Sixteen-year-old me, joining the colors after Father died in the mines. His face flushes red but he can't look away from how my transformed armor presents these impossible breasts, nipples visible through gaps in the scales.\n\nI turn to address the legion and see them all clearly now—every face is mine at different ages. Twenty-two-year-old Aldric who slew the marsh drake. Twenty-eight-year-old Aldric receiving his captain's commission. Hundreds of myselves, watching as their commander's armor continues its obscene metamorphosis.\n\nThe leather war-skirt shrinks, rides up, becomes a metal thong that parts my ass cheeks like a canyon through mountains. My sabatons reshape into towering heel-spikes that force my spine into a presenting arch. The sword-belt slides down my hips no matter how I clutch at it—Whisperwind's weight pulling it past the swell of this impossible ass.\n\n\"MAINTAIN FORMATION!\" I try to roar, but it emerges as a sultry plea. My tits—Eon's bones, they're so HEAVY—bounce with each word, the scale-mail cups shrinking further.\n\nFrom the command platform, the Marshal-General descends for inspection. The clink of his medals precedes him, but when he rounds into view—\n\nIt's Snib. Three feet eight inches of warty green authority stuffed into a uniform dripping with stolen valor. Behind him, the entire general staff: Colonel Snib, Major Snib, Captain Snib. A parade of goblins in human military dress, their massive bulges tenting regulation trousers.\n\n\"Commander Elise,\" Marshal-Snib says, his voice maintaining that wet-gravel rasp even through aristocratic affectation. \"Yer troops are... distracted.\"\n\nHe's right. Every version of myself stares at my transformed body. The youngest recruits giggle—high, feminine sounds wrong in soldiers' throats. Their armor begins to shift too, breastplates developing curves, codpieces vanishing to reveal smooth metal groins.\n\n\"This is... this isn't regulation,\" I stammer, trying to cover my tits with one arm while the other attempts to hide the absence between my legs.\n\n\"New regulations from His Majesty,\" Colonel-Snib announces, producing a scroll. \"All hero-class warriors to report for reassignment. Comfort Battalion. Morale Support Division.\"\n\n\"I'm a spellsword! I've killed a hundred—\"\n\n\"Says here ye've got the proper... qualifications.\" Major-Snib reaches up—even in my heels, he barely reaches my underboob—and WEIGHS one massive tit in his palm. \"Perfect for the new position. On yer back. Or knees. Or all fours.\"\n\nThe entire legion laughs. My past selves, all of them, pointing and jeering as my armor continues to shrink. The scale-mail top becomes pasties. The thong disappears entirely. I'm naked except for the collar that wasn't there before but has ALWAYS been there, its iron presence absolute.\n\n\"But the war,\" I protest weakly, my voice now pure feminine music. \"Sirath—the enemy—\"\n\n\"The enemy's between yer legs now,\" General-Snib grins, showing broken teeth.\n\nHe turns to address MY troops: \"MEN! Yer former commander will be serving the war effort in a new capacity! Servicing the... needs of our brave fighting forces!\"\n\nThey cheer. All my past selves cheer.\n\n\"Time for yer first inspection,\" Marshal-Snib commands. \"Bend over. Show the lads what they're fighting for.\"\n\nI can't stop myself. I bend at the waist, these massive tits hanging like udders, my ass presented to a thousand versions of who I used to be. The position feels military—precise, disciplined, regulation-approved degradation.\n\n\"ATTENTION!\" Snib barks.\n\nHis hand comes down on my ass with the crack of thunder—\n\n*THWACK!*\n\nI jerk awake to Snib's actual palm striking my actual ass, the dream-spank becoming real impact on naked flesh. The parade ground dissolves into his stinking hut.\n\nThe mission requires silence and depth.\n\nI swim through passages the dwarves abandoned when the lower galleries flooded—three hundred years ago by their reckoning, yesterday by the mountain's. The water here is wrong, viscous as pine-tar, purple-dark where my hand cuts through it. Green-blue algae paints the walls in ghost-light, just enough to see by. Just enough to know I'm alone.\n\nMy cock trails behind me, heavy in the thick water, a rudder I use to navigate. The tactical situation is clear: something waits in the deepest chamber. Something that requires reaching. The flooded shafts narrow as I descend, squeezing through gaps that scrape my shoulders, my hips.\n\nThe water grows warmer.\n\nMy body understands what my mind hasn't accepted yet—I'm too large for this. Too broad. Built for surface warfare, not this. The next squeeze costs me something. My cock detaches with a soft pop, painless as shedding a glove, and floats past my face. I watch it drift up toward air I left behind.\n\nAcceptable loss. Territory traded for position.\n\nThe passage widens into a chamber shaped like a womb, all smooth curves carved by centuries of patient water. My chest aches from holding breath—then doesn't ache. Swells instead, heavy with new ballast. Two weights hang from my ribs now, pale in the algae-light, tipped with peaks that drag against the viscous current.\n\nThe floor drops away beneath me. I dive.\n\nDeeper chambers. The water thickens to syrup consistency, each stroke requiring full commitment. My hips spread to assist the motion, become fins, become curves that cut through the medium with unexpected efficiency. Hair streams behind me—long, black, a navigation hazard I accept because turning back means surfacing as something that no longer fits the air.\n\nAt the bottom: a door.\n\nWhite light embedded in black stone, pure as the gap between stars. Through it I see—\n\nEboncrest. Our cottage. Elara at the stove, hair catching morning sun. And Aldric—*Aldric*—tall and broad and male, arms around her waist, both laughing at something the future forgot to save.\n\nMy past, preserved behind glass.\n\nI try to pass through. My body wedges in the frame—these new breasts, these hips, this softness that fills spaces the old body never knew existed. The door won't yield. Can't yield. The shape is wrong.\n\nSo I do what the water taught me. I *unmake*.\n\nFlesh becomes fluid, becomes flowing, pours through the keyhole like prayer through clenched teeth. I reform on memory's far side but the transformation stayed—breasts heavy as guilt, pussy empty as abandoned shrines, curves that apologize for occupying space.\n\nThe heroic Aldric doesn't see me. Neither does Elara. They move through their moment, that preserved fragment of joy, while I stand three feet away, invisible. A ghost haunting its own history.\n\nAldric—the *real* one, the *kept* one—lifts armor from a peg. Carries it to me without looking, begins dressing this new flesh like preparing a sacrifice. \"You'll need this where you're going.\" His voice holds all the warmth of forged iron.\n\nThe water level rises.\n\nNot water. White. Thick. Flooding from passages above, from every crack and crevice, the entire cave system filling with viscous seed-weight liquid that reeks of spent purpose. It pours into the memory chamber, rising past my ankles, my knees, covering the scene of domestic bliss with milk-white deletion.\n\nI can swim back. Return to the surface as this creature, accept the collar's verdict, live in the body that fits through doors made for slaves and fucktoys and breeding-stock. Stand in sunlight that won't recognize me.\n\n[Image: Or I can dive.\n\nOr I can dive.\n\nDeeper than caves. Deeper than the mountain's bones. Into cracks that predate kingdoms, that hold no air, no light, no compromise. Where even gods can't follow because they're too large, too defined, too committed to being themselves.\n\nI choose *down*.\n\nThe white flood rises to my breasts—they float, obscene buoys—but I'm already gone, pulling myself hand-over-hand into a fissure so narrow it scrapes these new curves raw. The viscous white pursues, seeking every crevice, trying to fill me, make me, claim me for surface reality.\n\nBut I'm faster. I'm smaller now. I can fit through gaps that heroism never reached.\n\nTotal darkness. No algae here. No light. Just pressure and the certain knowledge that I'm going where nothing can name me, define me, own me. The bedrock self that existed before Aldric, that will exist after Elise, that remembers how to be without needing shape to prove it.\n\nThe fissure tightens. My breasts compress, useful cushions now, letting me wriggle through stone that would skin muscle from bone. My ass—so much ass—provides purchase, flesh-grips that let me pull forward when hands fail. Every part of this wrong body becomes tool, becomes passage, becomes—\n\nSomething strikes my ass. Hard. Echoing through the deep water like hammer on shield.\n\nAgain. A slap that ripples through the viscous darkness.\n\nAgain. And the darkness cracks, splits, bleeds desert light—\n\n*CRACK!*\n\n\"Wakey wakey, cow-tits! Got work to do!\"\n\n)\n\n[Choice: Reality crashes back in...]\n\n[Choice: A rude awakening...]",

The metal thong *CLINK-CLINKS* with each impact, riding deeper into the valley between cheeks that used to be iron-hard muscle, now just... meat. Wobbling meat that won't stop moving even after his hand leaves.\n\nI try to roll away but these *things* on my chest pin me like sacks of wet grain.

Like a grub tryin' to flip! All that hero-muscle turned to jiggle-flesh!\"\n\nMy calves scream. The heel-boots locked my feet at that impossible angle all night—tendons shortened, muscles seized. When I try to flex my toes, nothing happens. They're numb meat stuffed into metal.\n\n\"Mmmmph!\" The sound tears from my throat—high, pathetic, *female*. Not my voice. Never my voice.\n\nteeth catch my shoulder through sweat and morning light. That's how I know Snib's warty fingers find purchase on my hip, rolling me onto my back. The motion sends everything into chaos—tits flopping toward my armpits, ass spreading wider than my shoulders used to be, the collar's weight shifting to choke my breath. Morning light through the cracks shows him perched above me like a gargoyle, wearing nothing but a fresh loincloth that does fuck-all to hide the morning tent of his cock.\n\n\"Kept yer tin-tits on all night?\" He reaches down, flicks the exposed nipple. Lightning shoots to my spine. \"Scared to show Master yer udders? HAHA! Nothing I won't see if I want, piglet. Yer *mine.*\"\n\nHe leans in close—too close—his breath hitting my face like opening a grave. His tongue, gray-green and too long, drags up my cheek in one wet stripe.\n\n\"Mmmm, even yer sweat smells like flowers growin' in shit.\" Another lick, this time catching the corner of my eye. \"Fancy hero-sweat.\"\n\nI should grab his throat. Should use these soft hands to gouge his eyes. Should—the collar tightens just thinking it, a reminder made of ice-cold iron.\n\n\"Got big plans today, me new maid!\" He scrambles off, his cock bouncing with each movement, that purple head already leaking strings of precum. \"See them?\"\n\nHe kicks a pile in the corner—dark brown leather strips covered in flies, so crusty they don't even bend when disturbed. The stench wafts over: concentrated ball-sweat, dried cum, and something diseased.\n\n\"Me under-wraps! All stiff-like, won't fold proper no more. Ye're gonna wash every one. Get 'em soft again. Use that pretty tongue if ye have to! HAHA!\"\n\nMy stomach turns. Those aren't just dirty—they're *fossilized* with his emissions.\n\n\"Then ye'll scrub me floors—on them udders! Sweep out the bones—dancin' in them spike-boots! And find me breakfast somewhere, something that ain't moldy!\" He counts on his fingers, struggling past three. \"Make this place fit for... for... a RICH goblin! With a pretty she-slave!\"\n\nHe prances around me in a circle, his cock swinging like a battering ram, occasionally dripping precum that lands too close. The morning sun makes his green skin glisten with grease.\n\n\"Never had me own place-cleaner before. Tribe always said Snib too small, too weak, never gonna get a female. But lookit what I got!\" He plants his foot on my stomach, toes splaying across skin that used to be armor-hard abs, now soft as risen dough. \"Got meself the biggest-titted hero-cunt in the kingdom! You!\"\n\nThe world tilts wrong when I try to sit up. These tits pull me forward but my ass weighs me backward and my spine doesn't know where center is anymore. Used to spring from prone to standing in one motion—now I'm beached, struggling against weights that shouldn't exist, metal edges sawing into tender flesh with each attempt.\n\nHe leans down, grabs a handful of my hair—silk-soft where it should be warrior-short—and *sniiiiiffs* deep.\n\n\"Even yer head-fur smells like meadow-fuckin! How's that work? Ye been rollin' in shit-hay all night but smell like ye bathed in honey-water!\" Another deep inhale. \"Collar made ye perfect for gobbos, didn't it?\"\n\nThat thought. That fucking thought. That I have been REDESIGNED. The way he rolls it on his tongue like candy.\n\nOutside, a desert lark calls to its mate. She's probably stirring their eggs, keeping them warm. Elara's waking up right now in our bed—alone. Running her hand across my empty pillow, wondering why I didn't come home. Wondering if I'm hurt. Dead. She doesn't know I'm here, listening to a goblin plan my day of domestic slavery while my tits refuse to fit in armor designed to humiliate.\n\n\"Say 'Yes, Master Snib!'\" A leash materializes around my head and he pulls it taut, forcing my head up at an angle that makes the collar bite. \"Show me ye still understand who owns this wobble-meat now!\"**THWACK! THWACK!**\n\nTwo more impacts. My ass—there's so MUCH of it—ripples like water in a well. Each strike makes the flesh dance in ways that muscle never would, continuing to jiggle long after his palm leaves. I try to curl tighter but there's nowhere for all this meat to GO. My thighs press together and feel nothing but smoothness where—\n\n\"Mmmph—stop—\"\n\nThe voice that comes out. High. Musical. Like I'm singing my protest instead of snarling it.\n\nMy eyes crack open. Morning light through gaps in the mud walls. Hay poking into naked skin that's too soft, too sensitive. And perched on my discarded armor like a gargoyle on a tombstone: Snib, grinning with all those broken-glass teeth, one warty hand still raised.\n\n\"Look at them haunches DANCE!\" He drums another quick pattern across my ass. *PAP-PAP-PAP-PAP*. \"Like butter-soft bread dough! Could play music on these!\"\n\nI try to roll away but forget—the... *tits.* That is what they are. I have to accept it.\n\nThey have their own momentum. When I turn, they keep going, dragging me further than intended, flopping across each other with a meaty *whap* that makes Snib cackle. My hands fly to cover them but there's too much. Soft flesh spills between my fingers, nipples hard as river pebbles from the morning cold catching between my knuckles.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Trying to hide me property?\" He hops off the armor—it clatters, the sound of my former protection mocking me. \"Them's MINE now, every bit. The sit-meat, the swing-bags, that smooth little—\"\n\n\"Don't.\" I pull my knees up, trying to hide everything at once. Impossible with this body. My ass pushes out behind me like I'm presenting it. My tits compress between my thighs and chest, nowhere near covered. Hair—so much fucking hair—falls across my face in black curtains.\n\n\"'Don't' she says!\" Snib scampers around me, his loincloth tented obscenely. That SMELL hits—concentrated piss-musk that makes my eyes water. \"Yer gonna 'don't' me in me own home?\"\n\nHe pokes my exposed ass with something—a stick? His finger? Each contact makes the flesh dimple and spring back.\n\n\"This place is a sty!\" He announces, like he's just noticed. \"And lucky me, I got meself a maid! Gonna make it proper-like. A home for... for...\" His warty face scrunches in concentration. \"A RICH goblin! With his own she-hero!\"\n\nI push myself up—try to. First attempt fails because I expect my arms to have strength they don't. Second attempt sends my tits swinging forward with such weight I nearly faceplant. Third attempt, I manage to get to sitting, these udders resting on my thighs, back curved by their pull.\n\nEverything's wrong. My spine wants to arch ways it shouldn't. My hips are so wide that sitting straight means my legs splay. The gap between my thighs leads to—\n\n\"Here!\" Snib kicks my armor at me. \"Can't have ye prancin' around all nude-like. Well, I COULD, but...\" He scratches his balls through his loincloth, the sound audible.\n\nThree triangles of black metal connected by chains. Yesterday they were just degrading. This morning they feel actively malicious.\n\nBecause I need to put them on.\n\nI reach for the top first. The clasps should be here, but—no. They've migrated. Hidden themselves under where my breasts will sit. I have to hold one tit up with my elbow while my fingers search for the mechanism. The metal's cold against my nipple, making it tighten further, scraping as I try to position it.\n\n\"That's it, wrestle them udders!\" Snib's dancing foot to foot, his cock-tent bouncing.\n\nThe first triangle barely covers my areola. When I reach for the second, the first pops free, my tit escaping with a bounce that makes Snib whoop. I try again. The chain's tangled now. I have to lean forward, tits hanging like ripe fruit, to untangle it.\n\n\"Like cow-bags at milkin' time!\"\n\nIgnore him. Get the armor on. Protect what little you can.\n\nFinally the top clicks into place. The triangles frame my tits more than cover them, pushing them up and together. The chains dig into my shoulders from the weight. When I breathe, the scales scrape across my nipples in a rhythm that makes me want to scream.\n\nThe bottom piece—I can't think about it as underwear—waits like a trap.\n\nStanding is its own ordeal. Without the mass I'm used to, I overcompensate and stumble. My ass jiggles. My tits continue their bounce a full second after I stop moving. I step into the metal thong and pull it up, the single strip immediately vanishing between my ass cheeks with a wet sound.\n\n\"THERE she is!\" Snib crows. \"Me own personal hero-whore! Now—\" He kicks a bucket at me. It clangs across the floor, stopping at my feet. \"Well's outside. Water. Lotsa water. This place needs scrubbin'.\"\n\nI stare at the bucket. Yesterday I held Whisperwind. Today I'm going to be on my knees, scrubbing goblin shit off a dirt floor.\n\n\"Oh! And these—\" He kicks over a pile of brown rags. No—not rags. His loincloths. The stench hits like a physical blow. They're crusty with dried... everything. Sweat, piss, cum, things I don't want to identify. \"Wash these too. They's getting stiff. Don't bend right.\"\n\n\"I'm not touching those.\"\n\n\"Yes ye are.\" Matter of fact. Not even a threat. \"Yer gonna make 'em clean and soft. Gonna have to really work 'em too—beat 'em on rocks, scrub with sand.\" His grin widens. \"Maybe suck on 'em to get the real deep stains out. HARHARHAR!\"\n\nMy stomach turns. Through the doorway, I can see the well—ancient stonework that predates the hut by centuries. The morning sun's already heating the sand. I'll have to walk out there in this armor, in these—\n\nThe boots. Still on the ground where I dropped them.\n\nThe heel-boots feel heavier this morning. When I sit to pull them on, my tits get in the way. I have to reach around them, breathing hard from the effort. The metal's shaped itself overnight—the inside curves to match my feet exactly, but in a way that forces my arches higher. When I stand, I immediately pitch forward.\n\n*CLOP-wobble-CLOP*\n\n\"There we go!\" Snib claps like a child at a puppet show. \"Proper she-slave now!\"\n\nThe collar's weight seems doubled this morning. Every time I move, it reminds me. The cold iron presses against my throat with each swallow.\n\n\"Now then—\" Snib yawns, showing all those broken teeth. \"Want this place SPOTLESS by sunset. All clean-like, like a humie's. And start with the corner where I keep me treasures.\" He points to the wall decorated with women's smallclothes. \"They need dustin'.\"\n\nHe waddles toward the door, pauses. \"Oh, and when I get back, yer gonna say it proper.\"\n\n\"Say what?\"\n\n\"Ye know what.\" He's adjusting himself, that massive thing shifting in his loincloth. \"When I tell ye to do somethin', ye say...\" He waits, grinning.\n\nI stare at him. Hatred so pure it could melt steel.\n\n\"Go on. Practice now. Say 'Yes, Master Snib!'\"",

      "text": "\"F-fuck you...\"\n\nThe words tear out of me, raw as a battle cry. My heel—this fucking spike—SLAMS into the dirt floor. The impact shoots up my calf, makes these tits judder, but I don't care. \"I'm not your thrakking maid! I'm not doing ANYTHING for—\"\n\n*YANK.*\n\nThe leash materializes from nothing—one moment my collar's just cold iron, the next there's a chain in Snib's fist and I'm pitching forward. These udders swing like siege engines, throwing me off balance. My hands hit dirt. My knees follow. The position—ass up, face down—\n\n\"Awww, the hero's havin' a tantrum!\"\n\n[Image: His warty foot plants itself on my ass like I'm a fucking footstool.\n\nHis bare foot plants on my ass. Not kick—just STEPS on it like it's a footstool. The flesh dimples around his warty toes. When he shifts his weight, my whole ass jiggles, the thong cutting deeper between the cheeks.\n\n\"Fergot who owns ye already?\" He yanks the leash again, dragging me backward. The metal triangles scrape across the floor, collecting dirt. \"Lemme remind ye—\"\n\nThe head grazes my lower back. Just grazes. The heat of it, the weight as it drags across my skin toward the valley of my ass—\n\n\"NO!\" I try to crawl forward but he's got the leash taut. This position, on all fours with him standing over me, his cock inches from—\n\n\"Could do it right now,\" he muses, like he's considering breakfast options. \"Just pull that little string aside and—\" He makes a wet thrust motion. \"Make ye a proper woman. Bet ye'd squeal like them village girls.\"\n\nTears. Actual tears pricking my eyes. Not from pain—from pure helpless rage.\n\n\"But nah.\" He steps off my ass, lets the leash go slack. \"Where's the fun in that? Rather watch ye CHOOSE it. Watch the great Aldric BEG for gobbo cock.\"\n\nHe waddles to the corner, his half-hard cock swinging. \"Look here.\"\n\nWhisperwind.\n\nMy beautiful blade, my soul-sister, my—\n\nIt looks like someone used it to scrape out a latrine. Goblin cum has dried in yellow-white sheets across the fuller, some places an inch thick. Stringy remnants hang like diseased spiderwebs from the crossguard. The inscription—ELISE - GOBLIN-OWNED HERO—seems to glow with malevolent pride through the cumcrust.\n\n\"Even yer sword knows the truth.\" Snib flicks one of the dried cum-strings. It vibrates with a sound like a sick harp. \"Says it right there. Goblin. Owned.\"\n\nSomething breaks in my chest. Not my spirit—something smaller. My pride maybe. The last delusion that this is temporary.\n\n\"Say it.\" His voice drops. Not threatening. Casual. Like he already knows. \"Say it proper and I'll even let ye clean that sword. Maybe use it! Got a cave needs clearin'. Gonna make ye earn yer keep doin' hero work.\" He grins. \"Well, hero-WHORE work, but still.\"\n\nThe words are ash and bile and death in my throat.\n\n\"Yes...\" My voice cracks. \"Master Snib.\"\n\n\"THERE we go!\" He claps his warty hands. \"See? Easy! And hey—\" His tone goes almost reasonable. \"Ten thousand gold, remember? Make me rich, ye go free. I keep me word. Even told the collar so.\"\n\nTen thousand. The number feels like another collar, tighter than the iron.\n\n\"Now then—\" He kicks the bucket toward me again. \"Water's outside. Them loincloths won't wash themselves. And make 'em SOFT! Me balls is chafin'!\"\n\nI stand—wobble-CLOP—and look at the pile of his loincloths. They're not even cloth anymore. They're... archaeology. Layers of dried sweat, piss stains mapping unknown territories, cum fossilized into the leather. Flies orbit them like tiny vultures.\n\nUsing a stick from the kindling pile, I spear one. It doesn't bend—it CRACKS, then dangles stiff as armor.\n\n\"Gonna need lots of scrubbin'!\" Snib settles into his furs to watch me work. \"Maybe soak 'em first. In yer mouth! HARHARHAR!\"\n\nI carry the contaminated stick at arm's length, the bucket in my other hand. Each step makes my ass roll, these tits bounce in opposition. The morning sun through the doorway promises another humiliation—doing laundry like a common washerwoman while this creature watches.\n\n\"Oh, Elise?\" He uses that name deliberately, twisting it. \"When yer at the well? Bend over proper-like. Wanna see them haunches work.\"\n\nThe stick trembles in my grip. One thrust and I could—\n\nThe collar tightens. Just a reminder.\n\nI *CLOP-CLOP* toward the door, each step in these spike-heels a small surrender. Behind me, Snib starts humming. Some goblin tune about breeding. Outside, the desert morning waits with its ancient well and the promise of scrubbing goblin filth while my wife wonders why her husband never came home.\n\nThe flap-door of the hut swings shut behind me. Through the wall I hear him:\n\n\"Yer gonna be the BEST slave-wife, Elise! Just wait!\"]My mouth opens. Nothing comes out.\n\nThe words sit on my tongue like stones. Three words. Three syllables. But they won't move from thought to speech because speaking them makes it REAL. Makes this morning real. Makes yesterday real. Makes Elise real and Aldric—\n\n*Stop.*\n\nElara woke up alone this morning. In our bed. The sheets still holding my shape, my scent. Did she reach for me? Did she—\n\n\"OI!\" Snib's voice cuts through. \"I'm WAITIN', cow-tits!\"\n\nI open my mouth again. Close it. My throat works but the collar seems to press tighter with each failed attempt, though that might just be my imagination. The words are right THERE. Just have to—\n\nCan't.\n\nWon't.\n\n\"Stubborn bitch, ain't ye?\" Snib's voice shifts to something almost amused.\n\nThe leash materializes in his fist—appears from nothing, chain links forming from smoke and malice. Before I can react, he YANKS.\n\nMy heel catches. I pitch forward, these massive tits swinging like pendulums. My hands shoot out but too slow—I hit the dirt floor face-first, the impact cushioned by flesh that shouldn't exist. The armor JINGLES mockingly as everything jiggles into place.\n\n\"Down where ye belong!\"\n\nI try to push up but the leash goes taut again, keeping my face in the dirt. My ass sticks up behind me, split by that metal strip. I scramble forward on hands and knees but he just STEPS on one cheek.\n\n[Image: His warty foot plants itself on my ass like I'm a fucking footstool.\n\nHis warty foot plants itself on my ass like I'm a fucking footstool. The weight's nothing—he's tiny—but the MEANING crushes everything. I freeze, breathing hard into the dirt, tits compressed beneath me.\n\n\"See? Easy.\" His voice comes from above, casual as discussing weather. \"Ye fight, ye fall. Ye run, ye choke. The collar knows. I know. When ye gonna learn, hero?\"\n\nSomething brushes the cleft between my ass cheeks. Something warm. Wet.\n\nHis cock.\n\nThe tip's emerged from his loincloth, that purple head weeping its poison. It slides along the metal thong, leaving a snail-trail of precum across the only thing separating him from—\n\n\"Could mount ye right now,\" he muses, almost to himself. His foot grinds into my ass flesh. \"Sink it all in. Breed ye proper while ye sob into the dirt. Would be... mmm... *satisfying.*\"\n\n\"But nah.\" He steps off, cock bobbing as he waddles toward the corner. \"More fun this way. Watching ye break slow-like.\"\n\nHe stops by the pile of refuse where Whisperwind lies.\n\nMy sword.\n\nThe morning light catches it—or tries to. The blade that once threw back sunlight clean now sits caked in layers of dried seed. Goblin cum's gone from yellow-white to crusty brown, thick as candle wax in places, thin as parchment in others. Strands of it drape from crossguard to tip like cobwebs, swaying when Snib nudges the blade with his foot.\n\nThe inscription—ELISE - GOBLIN-OWNED HERO—seems to glow with malevolent pride through the cumcrust.\n\n[Image: Seventeen years. Seventeen years that blade sang for me.\n\n\"Look at 'er!\" Snib taps the flat with his toes. Little flakes of dried spunk rain off. \"Even yer sword knows the truth now. Says it right there. GOBLIN. OWNED.\"\n\nSeventeen years. Seventeen years that blade sang for me. Through basilisk nests and troll warrens, through the Underworks and the Blood Marshes. The weight of her in my hand was the weight of PURPOSE. Of MEANING. Of who I was supposed to be.\n\nNow she's a cum-rag.\n\n\"Ye do good work today—\" Snib scratches his balls, making wet sounds. \"Scrub this shithole proper-like, wash me under-rags till they're soft again—maybe I'll let ye clean 'er. Maybe even USE 'er.\" He grins, showing all those broken teeth. \"Got a cave I been eyeing. Desert ruins. Full of old treasure, probably. Ye could help me PLUNDER it!\"\n\nHero work. In this body. With this... *meat.*\n\n\"Ten thousand gold!\" He announces it like a revelation. \"That's the price, remember? Make me RICH and ye walk free. I'll be true to me word on that—collar won't let me lie direct-like. So really, this is just... what's the word...\" He snaps his warty fingers. \"INVESTMENT! Yer me investment!\"\n\nHe waddles closer, leash still in hand, cock still half-out and drooling.\n\n\"But first, ye gotta show proper respect. Gotta use the RIGHT WORDS when Master Snib gives orders.\" He yanks the leash again, not hard, just a reminder. \"So. One more time. Nice and clear.\"\n\nThe words sit in my mouth like ash. Like grave-dirt. Like the taste of everything I was burning away.\n\nBut Whisperwind's there. Waiting. Defiled but waiting.\n\nAnd Elara's home. Waiting. Not knowing.\n\nTen thousand gold. That's a CONTRACT. A goal. Something to work toward that isn't just... this.\n\nMy lips move. The voice that comes out—high, musical, HERS—sounds like it's coming from miles away:\n\n\"Yes... Master Snib.\"\n\nThe words hit the air and I want to die.\n\n\"THERE IT IS!\" Snib does a little dance, his cock flopping. \"Music to me ears! Say it AGAIN!\"\n\n\"...Yes, Master Snib.\"\n\n\"AGAIN!\"\n\n\"Yes, Master Snib.\" Each repetition drives the knife deeper.\n\n\"Good girl!\" He pats my ass like I'm a horse. \"Now git to work. Them's me under-rags—\" He points to the pile of crusted leather strips, brown with every fluid a goblin can produce. Flies buzz around them. \"Beat 'em in the well-water. Use sand if ye have to. Get 'em SOFT again so they flex proper.\"\n\nHe releases the leash. It vanishes back into nothing, but the collar remains, its weight doubled.\n\nI push myself up slowly. Everything jiggles. The armor cuts and scrapes. These heel-boots make each step a calculated fall. I grab a stick from the corner—refuse to touch those rags with my hands—and start spearing them one by one, lifting them like dead rats.\n\nThe stench. Eon's fucking BONES, the stench.\n\nDried piss and cum and sweat, baked into the leather by desert heat, aged to perfection. One piece has actual MOLD growing on it. Another's so stiff it doesn't bend, just pivots like a plank.**\"Y-yes... Master Snib.\"**\n\nThe words taste like grave dirt.\n\n\"HARHARHAR!\" His whole body shakes with delight, cock-tent bouncing. \"Say it again! Louder!\"\n\nI swallow bile. \"Yes, Master Snib.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit!\" He scurries forward—fast for something so squat. Before I can react, his warty hand is on my inner thigh, fingers pressing into the soft meat there. Not my THIGH. Aldric had thighs like oak beams. This is... pudding. Warm pudding that dimples under his grip.\n\n[Image: Before I can react, his warty hand is on my inner thigh.\n\nI flatten against the wall but there's nowhere to go. He has to crane his neck to look up at my face, but his hand can reach everything that matters. His fingers trace higher—not touching the metal triangle, just the exposed flesh beside it. Close enough that I feel the heat of his palm through the scales.\n\nHe takes a deep, wet sniff. Like a hound catching scent.\n\n\"Mmmmm.\" Another inhale, his yellow eyes rolling back. \"That's fear-sweat mixed with she-musk.\"\n\nHis other hand points to the corner.\n\n\"Even yer sword knows the truth now.\"\n\nI follow his gesture and my chest caves in.\n\nWhisperwind.\n\n[Image: Not fallen. Defeated.\n\nThe blade leans against the wall like a drunk after a three-day binge. But it's what COATS it that breaks something inside me. Snib's cum from last night has dried into a grotesque shell—yellow-white plaster thick as tree bark in places, with stalactites of seedcrust hanging like cave formations. Individual pubic hairs are suspended in the mess, black wires in amber. The inscription—ELISE - GOBLIN-OWNED HERO—seems to glow with malevolent pride through the cumcrust.\n\nMy sword. The blade that split the Crimson Wyrm's skull. That saved villages. That was going to teach my children—Elara's and mine—the forms.\n\nNow it's a goblin's cumrag. A monument to my failure.\n\n\"Ten thousand gold.\" Snib's finger traces a circle on my thigh, leaving goosebumps. \"That's all ye need. Make me rich, and I keep me word—set ye free. I'm serious as death about that.\"\n\nHe pulls back, waddles to his pile of furs. \"But first, me clothes need washin'. Can't have a rich goblin wearin' crusties, can I?\"\n\nThe pile of loincloths looks like something exhumed from a plague pit. Brown leather stiff as boards, with white crystal formations where salt and worse have dried. Flies orbit them in lazy loops. The smell—concentrated crotch-rot mixed with whatever goblins leak when excited.\n\nI can't touch those.\n\nBut the collar sits cold on my throat, and I know what defiance brings.\n\nThere's a stick by the door. I grab it, use it to spear one of the loincloths. It doesn't bend. Just lifts rigid, like leather armor that's been soaked in—\n\nDon't think about it.\n\n*CLOP-wobble-CLOP*\n\nEach step toward the door makes my ass cheeks saw against the metal thong. My tits lead the way, their weight pulling my spine into an arch that makes my hips roll. The bucket handle cuts into my soft palm—no calluses anymore. Just tender skin that'll blister within minutes.\n\n\"That's it!\" Snib calls from his furs. \"Wiggle them hams! And remember—sunset! Want it so clean ye could birth babies on me floor!\"\n\n[Choice: Head to the well.",

The bucket of rags swings, flies buzz off in angry clouds, then resettle.\n\n*CLOP-sink-wobble.*\n\n[Image: The spike-bottoms flatten into discs, spreading my weight across the sand.\n\nMy third step, the boots finally remember their purpose. The spike-bottoms flatten into discs, spreading my weight across the sand. Not comfortable—the angle still forces my calves to scream—but walkable. Of course. The armor serves when I serve HIM.\n\nTwenty paces to the well. Might as well be twenty miles.\n\n[Image: gif]\n\nThe Shifting Sands stretch in every direction, dunes rolling like frozen waves under a sky so blue it hurts. Heat shimmer makes the horizon dance. In the distance, something that might be ruins—K'tarran stonework poking through sand like broken teeth. The old race built things that LASTED, even if they themselves didn't.\n\nSand-owls call from their burrows, that warbling three-note song that sounds like laughter. Glimmer-finches dart between scrub brush, their scales catching morning sun and throwing rainbow fractals. Beautiful. All of it beautiful.\n\n[Image: Glimmer-finches dart between scrub brush.\n\nAnd I'm walking through it in three metal triangles, carrying a bucket of cum-crusted goblin rags.\n\n*CLOP. CLOP. CLOP.*\n\nThe well rises from the sand—clean-cut stones fitted so perfectly no mortar shows. K'tarran work, no question. The joints form patterns that shouldn't be possible with hammer and chisel, geometric precision that makes my eyes want to slide away. A metal pump rises from the center, dark iron covered in symbols that weren't carved but somehow GROWN into the metal itself.\n\nNobody knows what killed the K'tarrans. Just that they're gone, leaving wells and ruins and warnings about things that sleep beneath sand.\n\nI set the bucket down. Dump the contents beside the well.\n\n[Image: gif]\n\nThe pile lands with a wet SLAP. Brown leather strips, each one stiff as dried hide, crusted with layers of—I don't look too close. Don't THINK too close. Just... refuse. Bodily refuse that's baked into the fabric under desert heat.\n\nFlies swarm immediately.\n\nI grab the pump handle. Pull.\n\nNothing.\n\nPull harder. The mechanism groans, metal scraping metal. Ancient but functional. One more pull and—\n\n*COUGH-SPLURT*\n\nBrown water gushes out, clearing itself as it runs. By the tenth pump, it's running clean and cold from deep stone.\n\nI don't think. Just cup my hands under the flow and drink.\n\nThe first mouthful hits my throat like winter rain. Sweet. Impossibly sweet—like someone dissolved honey in snowmelt. I gulp it down and immediately cup more, water running down my chin, between my tits, pooling in my cleavage. Don't care.\n\nI drink until my stomach aches. Until the collar digs in from swallowing. The water's so cold it makes my teeth hurt, washing away the taste of hay and morning bile and shame. My throat had been raw—from crying, from screaming, from saying \"Master\"—and now it's soothed, clean, almost...\n\nI kneel there gasping, water dripping from my face onto pale thighs. The coolness spreads through me like a blessing, like the Ephemerals finally remembering I exist.\n\nFor thirty seconds, I'm just a person drinking good water.\n\nThen I remember the bucket. The rags. What I'm here to do.\n\nThe relief drains away faster than the water down my throat.\n\nI fill the bucket halfway, set it on the well's rim. Now for the actual work.\n\nI use my boot-tip to flip one rag into the water. It floats for a moment, then starts to... leak. Yellow-brown tendrils curl off it like smoke in water, spreading through the bucket. The water clouds immediately.\n\nMy stomach turns.\n\nAnother rag. Same thing. The water's getting darker, taking on that same sour-milk reek that fills Snib's hut. I dump it, pump fresh water, try again.\n\nBy the fifth bucket, most of the visible crust is gone. The rags are just... damp leather now. Brown and stained but not actively CRUSTED.\n\n[Image: The leather's slick between my fingers, greasy with residue that won't wash away.\nI reach in barehanded.\n\nMy hands work automatically—the motions my mother taught me for washing clothes in the river, before I learned to swing a sword. Scrub, twist, wring. Scrub, twist, wring. The morning sun climbs higher. Sweat runs between my tits, pools in the small of my back.\n\nOne rag is particularly foul—dark brown in splotches, with white crusty patches that resist the water. I hold it up to see if it's clean enough.\n\nThe white patches start moving.\n\nNot moving—WRITHING. Little tadpole shapes breaking free from the fabric, swimming in the water droplets caught in the leather's weave. Hundreds of them. Thousands. Wriggling with desperate life, seeking—\n\nI drop the rag like it's on fire.\n\nTrick of the heat. Has to be. Just... water catching light wrong. But my skin crawls anyway, phantom sensation of those things REACHING for me, sensing female flesh, sensing—\n\n*Stop.*\n\nI know what goblin seed does. Every soldier knows. The stories from Westfall, from the border settlements. Women found weeks after raids, bellies already swelling, BEGGING not to be rescued. Saying they needed to go back. That their masters needed them.\n\nThis is why I killed so many. Not just because they're monsters. Because they're a PLAGUE. Because every goblin dick is a weapon pointed at civilization's throat.\n\nAnd now I'm washing their undergarments like a tavern washerwoman.\n\nI pump fresh water, scrub harder. Try not to think about those tadpole shapes. Try not to imagine them finding their way—\n\n\"Quite a sight, that.\"\n\nI spin. These tits keep spinning after I stop, sloshing water from the bucket.\n\n[Image: Snib's maybe ten paces away, squatting like a gargoyle.\nSnib's maybe ten paces away, squatting like a gargoyle. How long has he been watching? His loincloth's tented—of course it is—and he's grinning that broken-glass grin.\n\n\"Didn't know hero-cunts could scrub so pretty-like.\" He hops off the rock, waddles closer. His cock's actually emerged from the loincloth, purple head bobbing with each step. \"All bent over, them big sit-bags swingin', workin' so HARD on me delicates...\"\n\nI straighten, water running off my hands. The rags lie in the bucket, mostly clean now. Or clean enough. I need to hang them to dry, get back inside, start on the actual floor—\n\n\"Tell ye what.\" Snib stops beside the well, one hand idly stroking his cock. The smell hits—that concentrated musk that makes my head swim. \"Ye're workin' so hard fer yer freedom. Ten thousand gold, right? Big number.\"\n\nI don't answer. Don't trust my voice.\n\n\"But I'm feelin'... GENEROUS.\" His grin widens. \"Do the rest of yer mornin' chores in yer skin. No metal. Just meat. And I'll knock...\" He pauses, considering. \"Five HUNDRED gold off yer debt.\"\n\nMy hands clench into fists.\n\n\"Think about it,\" he continues, still stroking. Precum's dripping now, making wet sounds on the sand. \"That's five hundred less ye gotta earn. Five hundred steps closer to that wife of yers.\" His voice drops. \"Course, ye'd have to spend all day lettin' me LOOK. Can't touch—not today anyway—but I can look all I want. At them big fuckin' udders. That fat arse. That smooth little—\"",

Ice-cold iron compressing my windpipe until black flowers bloom across my vision. I drop to my knees in the sand, clawing at smooth metal that offers no purchase. Can't breathe. Can't—\n\n[Image: The collar *bites*.\n\nIt releases just enough to let air whistle through.\n\n\"HAHAHAHA!\" Snib's doubled over, slapping his knee. \"Look at 'er! All red-faced and gaggin'! Ye never learn, do ye?\"\n\nI gasp into the sand, these fucking udders compressed beneath me, spilling out the sides of the metal triangles. Drool runs from my mouth. My throat feels crushed.\n\n\"Could make this EASIER on yerself,\" Snib wheezes through his laughter. \"But no—stubborn cow wants to do it the hard way.\" He adjusts his cock, which hasn't softened at all from watching me choke. \"Fine by me! More entertainment!\"\n\nI push myself up slowly. Scrub my hands in the sand—rough grains scouring my palms until they're raw. Can't let any residue near my face. Can't risk even a DROP of that poison getting where it could—\n\nWhy did I go barehanded? Should've used the stick the whole time. Should've been SMARTER. But something about the task just... made me forget. Made me do it properly.\n\nThe thought makes my skin crawl.\n\nI grab the bucket of sopping rags and stalk—as much as one can stalk in heel-boots—back toward the hut. Snib follows, whistling some goblin tune off-key. I find a length of rope inside, string it between the hut and the dead olive tree.\n\n*CLOP. CLOP.*\n\nEach step across the sand. Each movement making everything jiggle. The armor cuts deeper from the sweat and effort.\n\n\"Ye know—\" Snib's found shade under a scraggly acacia, squatting there like a toad. \"This don't have to be so painful between us. Ye make me happy, things go FASTER. Keep fightin' and...\" He shrugs. \"Well, ten thousand gold's a big number. Could take years.\"\n\n[Video]\n\nI wring out a rag. Hard. Pretending it's his neck. Water spatters the sand.\n\n\"Just tryin' to help,\" he continues in that wheedling tone. \"Good slaves get rewards. Stubborn bitches just get more work.\" He spreads his legs, letting his cock flop obscenely. \"But hey—yer choice, tit-slave. Yer choice.\"\n\nI hang the rags one by one. They drip onto sand that's already baked dry by mid-morning heat. The wind catches them, makes them flap like the world's most pathetic victory banners.\n\nThis is my life. This is what I've become.]I don't even look at him.\n\nMy hands reach for the first rag, wring it one more time. Water streams off, brown but clearer than before. I drape it over my arm and move toward the dead olive tree that props up Snib's hut. Need rope. Need to string a line.\n\n\"Aw, c'mon!\" His voice follows me. \"Five hundred! That's good gold! Just gotta show off what ye already got!\"\n\n*CLOP. CLOP.*\n\nInside the hut, I find rope—frayed hemp that probably came from some caravan Snib picked clean. I string it between the tree and a post driven into the sand, tying knots with fingers that still feel greasy despite the water.\n\n\"Silent treatment, eh?\" Snib waddles after me, still stroking himself. \"That's fine. I like watchin' ye work anyway. All that JIGGLE. All that—hehehe—*bounce.*\"\n\nI hang the first rag. It drips onto the sand.\n\n\"Could be easier between us, y'know.\" He settles into the shade beneath the tree, cock still out, still leaking. Starts humming something—goblin tune, wet and tuneless. \"Ye make me happy, this goes faster fer ye. Fight me every step, and...\" He shrugs. \"Well. Still gets where it's goin', just takes longer.\"\n\nThe second rag goes up. Third. My hands move automatically while my mind tries to be ANYWHERE else.\n\n[Video]\n\nFourth rag—my fingers touch something crusty. I jerk back, then realize what I've done. Touched them. Touched the seed-soaked leather with bare skin. Didn't even THINK about it when I started scrubbing.\n\nWhat's wrong with me?\n\nI crouch by the sand pile, scrub my hands raw with grit. Rub until my palms burn. The stories from Westfall—how it gets IN you. Through cuts, through your mouth if you're stupid enough to—\n\n\"Careful there, cow-tits.\" Snib's watching with interest. \"Gonna scrub yer pretty hands bloody.\"\n\nThe final rags go up. They hang limp in the dead air, dripping brown water that makes dark spots in the sand. His undergarments. His *delicates*. Strung up like festival banners.\n\n\"There we go!\" Snib claps, making his cock bounce. \"Now don't that look PROPER? Like a real home! With a real she-slave keepin' things nice!\"\n\n]The number sits in my mouth like copper coins. Five hundred. A tenth of my freedom. A tenth closer to Elara, to ending this, to—\n\nBut naked. Specifically FOR him. So he can watch. So he can ENJOY watching.\n\nMy silence stretches. Snib just laughs, that wet phlegm rattle.\n\n\"Thought so! Knew ye'd—\"\n\n\"I'll do it.\"\n\nThe words come out flat. Dead. Like someone else said them.\n\nSnib stops mid-cackle. His yellow eyes go wide, then narrow with glee so pure it makes my stomach turn.\n\n\"Well THRACK me sideways!\" He does a little dance, cock flopping. \"The hero's got SENSE after all!\"\n\nI turn back to the bucket. The rags need hanging. There's a dead olive tree between the hut and—I need rope. Inside. Get rope, string it between tree and hut, hang the rags, then—\n\nMy hands shake as I dump the bucket, refill it with the cleaner rags. The morning sun's climbing higher. Already hot. Going to be worse.\n\n*Just five hundred gold. Just numbers. Just—*\n\nI find rope inside—old hemp, frayed but functional. String it between the gnarled olive trunk and a nail jutting from the hut's wall. The armor jingles with every movement, scales scraping across nipples that have gone hard from... from the morning cold. That's all.\n\nSnib follows me like a dog watching its master prepare dinner.\n\nThe rope's secure. The rags wait in the bucket. And now—\n\nMy hands go to the bikini top's clasps. They've hidden themselves again, little mechanisms tucked under where my tits rest. I have to lift the left one, fingers fumbling, feeling Snib's eyes on every motion.\n\n*Click.*\n\nThe first triangle springs free. My tit drops, bounces, settles. The nipple's at full attention, pink and obscene against pale flesh.\n\n\"Ohhhhh FUCK yes...\" Snib's voice goes breathy.\n\n*Click.*\n\nThe second releases. Both tits hang free now, heavy as grain sacks, swaying when I breathe. I drop the top in the sand, reach for the thong.\n\n[Image: My ears burn. My whole face burns.\n\nMy ears burn. My whole face burns. The metal strip peels away from between my ass cheeks with a wet sound—sweat—and my pussy... I don't look. Don't acknowledge. Just step out of it, the metal clattering in the sand.\n\n\"LOOK AT THAT!\" Snib's literally hopping. \"Look at them—them BIG PINK CIRCLES! Never seen humie nipples that close! And when ye bent over just now, yer—yer CUNT-LIPS were peekin' out! All smooth and—\"\n\nI scrub my hands in the sand. Hard. Rough grains scouring my palms, getting under my nails. Goblin seed. Goblin ANYTHING. Get it OFF.\n\nWhy did I go barehanded? Why didn't I think—\n\n*Because you're still thinking like Aldric, who never had to worry about this shit.*\n\nThe sand scrubs away the slickness, the invisible residue. I do it three times before my hands feel clean enough to touch my face.\n\n\"This don't have to be painful, ye know.\" Snib's settled under the olive tree now, cock in hand. *SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK.* \"Ye make me happy, this goes FASTER. Just like now! Smart girl, takin' the deal!\"\n\nI turn away, grab the first rag, start hanging them on the rope. My tits sway with each reach. Can feel them moving, feel the weight pulling at muscles that shouldn't exist. The sun's already making sweat run between them.\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK.*\n\n\"That's it, work them arms! Makes the udders BOUNCE!\"\n\nAnother rag. Another. The line fills with brown leather strips, dripping onto sand. I keep my eyes on my work. Anywhere but him. But I can HEAR it—that wet rhythm, his breathing getting heavier.\n\n\"Bet yer wife never had to do this, eh?\" *SCHLICK-SCHLICK.* \"Bet she got to wear CLOTHES while she worked!\" He laughs, this wheezing giggle. \"But not you! Not the great Aldric! Now ye're hangin' me ball-rags with yer tits out!\"\n\nMy hands clench on the next rag. Squeeze. Water runs down my forearms.\n\n\"Turn around! Lemme see the FRONT again!\"\n\nI don't.\n\n\"Aw, shy now?\" More laughter. He starts humming—some goblin tune, all wrong notes and rhythm. Just... sitting there. Watching. Stroking. ENJOYING this.\n\nThe last rag goes up. The line's full, dripping, smelling of water and desert heat. I reach for my armor—\n\n\"Ah-ah-ah!\" Snib wags a finger, still stroking. \"Deal was ALL mornin' chores, hero-cunt. Still gotta clean inside! And...\" He grins wider. \"Gotta find me breakfast. Somethin' good! Cactus fruit, maybe. Or a nice fat lizard!\"\n\nHe wants me to hunt. Naked. In the desert.\n\n\"After that, ye can have yer metal back.\" *SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK.* His other hand's fondling his balls now, those apple-sized things. \"But fer now? Ye're me entertainment AND me worker! Best deal I ever made!\"\n\n[Choice: Find food.]\n\nHe stands, tucks himself back into his loincloth—mostly. \"Right then. Next chore. Breakfast.\" He pats his belly. \"Yer Master's hungry. And lucky fer ye, this land's got PLENTY if ye know where to look.\"\n\nHe points toward the scrubland east of the hut. \"Cactus fruit. Lizards if ye can catch 'em. Maybe some beetles under them rocks. I ain't picky.\" That grin again. \"Well, I WASN'T picky. Now I got me own personal hero to do me huntin' fer me!\"\n\nI look down at my hands. Still feel greasy. Still feel like they're crawling with those tadpole shapes.\n\n\"Off ye go then!\" He makes shooing motions. \"And remember—no magic! Collar won't let ye anyway, but just in case ye forgot: yer powers are MINE now. Only use 'em when Master says so!\"\n\n[Choice: Search for food...]",

With what—yer tits? Gonna smother a lizard between them fat—\"\n\n\"A. Blade.\" My hands clench. The collar tightens slightly.\n\nSnib sighs like I'm ruining his fun, waddles into the hut. Returns with something that makes my stomach turn: a curved knife, maybe eight inches, the kind you use for gutting. The blade's crusted with old blood—human? goblin?—and the handle's wrapped in stained leather.\n\n\"Here.\" He tosses it. I catch it by reflex. \"Don't go gettin' ideas. That collar'll feel it if ye even THINK about pointin' it me way.\"\n\nI look at the knife. Look at Whisperwind in the corner, still cake-smeared and defiled. Look back at this piece of shit in my hand.\n\nThis is what I'm reduced to.\n\n\"And...\" I force the next words through my teeth. \"Fire. Need coals. For cooking.\"\n\n\"Givin' me orders now?\" Snib's on his feet instantly, that quick goblin speed. His hand cracks across my ass—*WHAP!*—making the flesh jiggle.\n\n\"Please.\" The word burns coming out. \"We'll eat faster if—\"\n\n\"'Please Master Snib!'\" He corrects, grabbing a handful of ass meat and squeezing. \"Say it RIGHT!\"\n\n\"Please... Master Snib.\"\n\n\"Better!\" He releases me, starts gathering dried grass and twigs. \"Lucky fer you I'm hungry too. But next time ye ASK properly first go!\"\n\n[Image: The morning sun hammers down as I head back into the desert.\n\nThe Shifting Sands spread before me—endless dunes broken by stubborn vegetation that survives on spite and morning dew. My armor *jingles* with each step, the triangular cups scraping across nipples, the thong sawing between my cheeks. But underneath...\n\nMy skin should be burning. This pale flesh exposed to desert sun should be turning red, blistering. Instead it just... glows. Like the heat feeds it somehow.\n\n[Image: The prickly-pear's moisture beads like sweat, each drop catching sun.\nI spot a cluster of bloodbrush first—those thorny shrubs with the crimson berries that only fruit after the rare rains. Three sennights ago we had a downpour; the berries are perfect now, each one swollen with juice that's sweet-tart and full of seeds. Warriors eat them on long marches when water's scarce—they keep your mouth from drying out.\n\nThe knife works well enough to cut away the worst thorns. I gather two handfuls of berries into a pouch I create from a broad succulent leaf.\n\n*CLOP-CLOP-CLOP* across the sand. The boots flatten more, spreading my weight. My tits bounce with each step, hypnotic rhythm that I can see in my peripheral vision.\n\nThere—a young prickly-pear, its paddles still tender green instead of tough gray. Perfect. The desert-mothers in the Sandwalker tribes candy these with honey when they can get it. Without honey, you need something else sweet. The bloodbrush berries will do.\n\nI squat—everything jiggles—and use the knife to shave away the spines. Each one comes off with a little *pop*, revealing flesh underneath that weeps clear moisture. The smell hits immediately: green and bright, like cucumber but sharper. Makes my mouth water. When did I eat last? Yesterday morning with Elara—\n\n[Video]\n\n*Stop.*\n\nThe knife splits the paddle lengthwise, leaving one edge intact like a pocket. I crush the berries between my palms—the juice runs red as blood down my wrists—and pack the mash inside. A stick from a dead mesquite holds it closed\n\nBack at the hut, Snib's got a small fire crackling. The smoke stings my eyes as I nestle the stuffed paddle beside—not on—the coals.\n\n\"What's that supposed to be?\" Snib demands, poking it with a stick.\n\n\"Food.\" I turn the paddle with another stick, making sure it heats evenly. The skin starts to blister, little bubbles forming and popping. Steam escapes from the edges, carrying the smell of berries cooking in their own juice and the green-bright scent of cactus flesh softening.\n\nAfter about ten minutes—you count time in the desert by how many breaths it takes for sweat to evaporate—the paddle's ready. The outside has blackened in spots, the berries inside have broken down into jam. I split it open on the one clean plate in this shithole, the ruby-red filling oozing out, studded with seeds.\n\n[Video]My stomach clenches, hollow and angry. I scrape some of the jam with my fingers, get it halfway to my mouth—\n\n*WHAP!*\n\nSnib's hand slaps mine away, snatches the plate.\n\n\"Mine first!\" He takes a massive bite, red juice running down his chin. Makes a face. \"Tastes like... plant.\"\n\n\"It's good for you.\" The words come out bitter.\n\n\"Humie food,\" he mutters, but keeps eating. Gobbles the whole thing in four bites, even gnaws the cactus skin. \"Needs meat. Or maggotsss... bah, maybe YOU need to learn to cook GOBLIN FOOD\" He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Least it fills the belly.\"\n\nI scrape what's left in the preparation area—a few spoonfuls of jam, some cactus flesh—into my mouth. Even this little bit makes me feel... full? Like this body needs less than—\n\n\"Right then!\" Snib stands, patting his pot belly. \"Time to clean inside! Want me home SPOTLESS! Like a proper rich goblin's supposed to have!\"\n\nHe grabs my ass as I stand, fingers digging into soft flesh.\n\n\"Move that big arse!\"\n\n[Choice: Start cleaning the hut interior...]\"Need a knife.\"\n\nThe words come out flat. Practical. Like I'm requisitioning equipment from the quartermaster, not begging a goblin for tools.\n\nSnib's eyes flick to the corner where Whisperwind leans—still crusted, still defiled. His grin spreads.\n\n\"Got just the thing!\" He scuttles over to his refuse pile, rummages through bones and rags, pulls out a blade maybe six inches long. Rusty. Brown stains near the hilt that definitely aren't rust.\n\nHe tosses it. I catch it.\n\nThe handle's warm. Sticky. I wipe it on... nothing. I'm naked. I wipe it in the sand, scrubbing until my palm burns.\n\n\"And...\" I hate asking. \"I need coals. Fire. We'll eat faster if—\"\n\n\"Making DEMANDS now?\" But he's already moving toward the fire pit, grabbing dried dung and kindling. \"Fine, fine. Don't want to wait all day fer me food.\"\n\nHe's doing something I asked. We're... working together.\n\nThe thought makes me want to vomit.\n\nI step back out into the desert, blade in hand, completely naked except for the collar.\n\n[Image: My skin seems to drink the heat, adapt to it.\n\nThe sun hits like a forge. Should be burning my skin already—I'm pale as temple marble, never had to work shirtless like the mine laborers. But instead... warmth. Uncomfortable but not blistering. My skin seems to drink the heat, adapt to it.\n\nLike this body was MADE for goblin territory.\n\nI look down at myself. Pale curves catching light. Tits that cast their own shadows. The smooth nothing between my legs. My feet are bare on hot sand and it should hurt but it just... doesn't. Not like it would have yesterday.\n\nEverything about this flesh seems designed to survive in places goblins thrive.\n\nI hate it.\n\n[Image: The prickly-pear's moisture beads like sweat, each drop catching sun.\n*Focus. Food. Get it done.*\n\nThe Shifting Sands aren't completely barren—you just have to know where to look. Scrub brush clusters around rocks that trap morning dew. Desert sage grows low and grey. And there—\n\nRed berries. Thornback berries, the Sandwalkers call them. Tart enough to pucker your mouth, but safe if you know which ones. The round ones with five points on top. Never the oval ones.\n\nI pick a handful, crushing them in my palm to check the juice. Dark red. Good.\n\nTwenty paces further: a young prickly-pear, its pad fat and green. Perfect.\n\nThe knife makes quick work of the spines, scraping them away with the blade's edge. The glochids—those tiny invisible bastards—take longer. Have to hold it up to sunlight, see where they catch, scrape clean. My hands remember this from survival training, from those sennights in the Scorched Barrens chasing the Westfort raiders.\n\nBack then I had clothes. Among other things.\n\nI slice the pad lengthwise, careful not to cut through the far edge. It opens like a pocket—thick, moist flesh inside. I pack it with crushed berries, dark red juice running down my fingers. Push it closed, skewer it with a twig to keep it shut.\n\n[Video]\n\nThe coals are ready when I get back. Snib's lounging on his furs, cock still out, watching me walk with obvious interest.\n\n\"Them's some long legs on ye! All that MEAT swingin' around!\"\n\nI nestle the stuffed cactus beside the coals. Not on them—that'll burn it. Just close enough that the heat penetrates, starts steaming the berries inside their green pouch.\n\nThe smell hits after maybe two minutes. Sweet and smoky. Tart. My stomach growls—when did I last eat? Yesterday morning with Elara, before—\n\n*Don't.*\n\n[Video]I turn the cactus, watching the skin blister and soften. Eight minutes. Ten. The pad goes from rigid to yielding under my knife-tip. Ready.\n\nI split it open, squeeze. Thick ruby jam oozes out, still steaming. I scrape it onto Snib's cracked plate—the only plate—and grab a scrap of cactus flesh for myself, chewing as I work.\n\nThe tartness cuts across my tongue. Green and alive and—\n\nI'm full.\n\nNot finished—just... full. The portion I ate while cooking would've been an appetizer before. Now it sits in my stomach like a full meal.\n\nThis body needs less. Smaller. Everything smaller.\n\nI set the plate in front of Snib, still naked, still collared, still his.\n\nHe stares at it. At the dark jam pooling on cracked ceramic. His nose wrinkles, sniffing. Then he takes a bite.\n\nHis eyes close.\n\nThe expression on his face—I can't read it at first. His jaw works, chewing slowly. Swallows. Opens his eyes and stares at me like I've done something impossible.\n\n\"This... this ain't rotten.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It's... good?\" He says it like a question. Like he doesn't trust the concept. Takes another bite. \"Fuck me, it's GOOD!\"\n\nSomething in my chest swells. Just a little. Pride at work done well, at—\n\nNo.\n\nNO.\n\nI just cooked for my enslaver. I'm feeling PROUD that a goblin likes my food.\n\n\"Right!\" Snib sets the empty plate aside, licks his fingers. \"Now the INSIDE. Gotta get this place proper-like!\" He gestures at the hut's interior—the crusted furs, the dirt floor, the refuse piles. \"Scrub it all, hero-cunt. And since ye're already dressed fer it...\" He grins. \"Might as well stay that way!\"\n\n[Choice: Clean the hovel... naked.]",

The thong rides up with each motion until it's practically inside me.\n\n\"Better! Look at them milk-sacks sway!\"\n\nI grit my teeth. Sweep harder. The pile grows—bones, refuse, dead beetles, scraps of leather that might have been clothing once.\n\n\"Now the trophies.\" He points at the wall of women's undergarments. \"Gentle-like! They're delicate!\"\n\nI stop looking. Just dust with a rag I found, trying not to think about who wore these, where they are now.\n\n\"Arrange 'em by size!\" Snib's rubbing himself through his fresh loincloth, making wet sounds. \"Biggest to smallest! Like ye're settin' up shop!\"\n\nMy hands shake as I rearrange them by size. The biggest ones on the left. Down to the smallest on the right. Like trophies. Like—\n\n\"Perfect! Now ye can see—smallest ones were the TIGHTEST! HARHARHAR!\"\n\n\"You're disgusting.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" His voice goes dangerous.\n\n\"Nothing... Master Snib.\"\n\n\"Thought so. Now—floor time! See that bucket? Fill it. Hands and knees. SCRUB.\"\n\nSome of the floor is wooden planking—stolen from Eboncrest's mill by the maker's marks. The rest is packed dirt. All of it is filthy. I fill the bucket at the well, come back, get on my knees.\n\nThe position is obscene. Ass in the air, tits hanging down nearly touching the floor. I grab the rag and start scrubbing.\n\n*JINGLE-JINGLE-JINGLE*\n\nThe armor mocks me with each motion. Forward and back, forward and back. The wooden planks are starting to show grain underneath years of grime.\n\n\"LOOK at that arse-shelf work!\" Snib's on his feet now, circling me. \"All that sittin'-meat just WOBBLING! And when ye reach forward—HAH!—can see yer smoothie peeking out!\"\n\nI scrub harder. Try to ignore him. Try to ignore how my tits drag across the wet floor when I reach too far.\n\n\"Tell ye what—\" He squats right beside me, close enough that I can smell his musk. \"That big rump's just BEGGIN' for attention. If ye ASK me nice—real nice—to give it a squeeze, I'll knock five hundred gold off yer debt.\"\n\nMy hand stops mid-scrub.\n\n\"But ye gotta ASK.\" His grin could strip paint. \"Gotta say 'Please Master Snib, grab me arse while I clean yer floor.' And WIGGLE it. Show ye want it.\"\n\nI turn to look at him, eyes burning with hatred so pure it should set him ablaze.\n\n\"Just fer lettin' me enjoy what I already own!\" He reaches toward my ass, stops just short. \"But only if ye INVITE it.\"\n\n]The broom's just a stick with dried grass tied to one end. Functional. Barely.\n\nI start with the bones.\n\nThey're everywhere—rat skulls, what might be bird wings, something with too many ribs scattered near his fur pile. I gather them in my hands, toss them out the door. Each bend makes my tits swing, heavy and pendulous. Snib's watching from his furs, new loincloth on, hand already moving underneath the leather.\n\n\"That's it, work them haunches! Bendin' and showin' me EVERYTHING!\"\n\nThe refuse pile next. Broken pottery, moldy bread, a child's wooden horse with one leg missing. I don't think about where that came from. Just sweep it into a pile, carry it out in armfuls.\n\nThe smallclothes on the wall—trophies of past... I don't think about it either. Just dust them with the broom, watching sand fall. Lace and cotton and silk, all faded, all nailed like hunting kills.\n\n\"Careful with them! Each one's got a STORY!\" Snib cackles. \"That blue one? She SQUEALED real pretty when—\"\n\n\"I don't want to know.\"\n\n\"Course ye don't! Too busy showin' me yer arse-crack every time ye reach up!\"\n\nThe floor's next. Part dirt, part wooden planking that's warped from moisture and waste. I sweep what I can—dust, sand, things I don't identify. The wooden sections need scrubbing.\n\n\"Down on yer knees fer the wet work!\" Snib announces. \"Want it PROPER clean!\"\n\nI kneel. The position's obscene—ass up, tits hanging. I grab a rag from the bucket, start scrubbing the planks.\n\n\"THERE'S the view!\" Snib's hand moves faster. *SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK.* \"Bet ye never thought the mighty Aldric would be arse-up in a goblin's hut, did ye?\"\n\nThe planks are sticky with old spills. I scrub harder, trying to lose myself in the work. Can't. Every motion makes everything jiggle. My tits brush the floor. My thighs rub together.\n\n\"That meal ye made...\" Snib's voice goes thoughtful. \"Never had nothin' like that. Not rotten. Not old. Just... MADE fer me.\" He shifts on the furs. \"Ye know what? I'm feelin' GENEROUS again.\"\n\nI keep scrubbing. Don't look up.\n\n\"Here's the deal, sittin'-meat. Ye ASK me—nice and proper-like—if I can give yer big fat arse-globes a good SQUEEZE. Just feel 'em up while ye work. And I'll take another two hundred fifty gold off yer debt.\"\n\nMy hands stop. The rag drips onto wood.\n\n\"Course, ye gotta ASK. Can't just let me—gotta use yer words. Say...\" He pauses, thinking. \"'Master Snib, will ye please fondle me big wobbly sit-cushions?'\" His laugh rattles. \"Somethin' like that!\"\n\nSeven hundred fifty total. Three quarters of the way to a thousand. A TENTH of my freedom just from this morning's degradation.\n\nBut asking him. ASKING to be touched.\n\n\"Tick-tock, tit-slave! Offer's only good while yer on all fours! Once ye stand up, price goes back to normal!\"",

      "text": "The words won't come.\n\nI open my mouth. Close it. My hands grip the wet rag so tight water streams between my fingers. Five hundred gold. Just words. Just letting him touch what he's already touched. What he already owns according to the collar.\n\n*Just say it.*\n\n\"I...\" My voice cracks. This high, musical thing that isn't mine. \"Please...\"\n\nThe word hangs there. Can't finish. Can't—\n\n\"Please what?\" Snib's moved closer. Can smell him—musk and old sweat and that undertone of precum that never leaves. \"Gotta say it ALL, cow-tits!\"\n\nMy whole body shakes. Not fear. Rage. Rage so pure it makes my vision swim. But underneath that rage—calculation. Five hundred gold. That's real. That's progress. That's—\n\n\"Please... touch...\" The words drag out of me like pulling teeth. \"Touch my...\"\n\n\"Nah nah nah!\" Snib waves a finger. \"Not 'touch.' I said GRAB. And not just 'my'—gotta call it what it is! That big fat arse-shelf! That sit-meat! That—\"\n\n\"Please grab my ass.\"\n\nIt comes out in a rush. Like vomiting.\n\n\"Almost!\" He's dancing now, \"But ye forgot the most important part! WHO'S askin'?\"\n\nI know what he wants. Know exactly what he—\n\n\"Please grab my ass... Master Snib.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n*And?* There's MORE?\n\n\"And WIGGLE it!\" He demonstrates, shaking his own scrawny ass. \"Show me ye WANT it! That ye're ASKIN' for it!\"\n\nI shift my weight. The motion makes my ass move. Barely. Just a tremor.\n\n\"BIGGER!\"\n\nI close my eyes. Move my hips. Feel the massive globes of flesh shift and bounce. The armor clinks. My tits sway beneath me.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! There it is! Now say it again! All together!\"\n\nThe rag drops from my hands. They hang at my sides, useless. When I open my eyes, Snib's right there. Three feet of warty green triumph, reaching up toward me.\n\n\"Please...\" My voice is dead. Flat. Something broken crawling out of my throat. \"Please grab my ass, Master Snib.\"\n\nHis hands—both of them—sink into my flesh from behind.\n\n[Image: Not a quick grope. He GRABS.\nNot a quick grope. He GRABS. Fingers digging deep into meat that's too soft, too much. His warty palms spread my cheeks through the armor, and there's this sound—this wet *squelch*—that makes my whole body go rigid.\n\n\"Ohhhhh THRACK that's nice!\" He's looking up at me, those yellow goat-eyes bright with sick joy. \"Feel how it just... GIVES! Like dough! Like—\"\n\nHe starts kneading. Spreading. Squeezing. I'm looking down at him, bottom lip trembling, as this little creature just... HANDLES me. His fingers find the crease where ass meets thigh. Pinch. Pull. Make the flesh dance.\n\n*SLAP!*\n\nHis palm cracks across my right cheek. The meat jiggles for three full seconds.\n\n*SLAP! SLAP!*\n\n\"Like slappin' a drum!\" He's ecstatic. \"A big meat drum!\"\n\nMy hands stay at my sides. The armor jingles with each impact. I can't move. Can't pull away. Asked for this. BEGGED for it. Five hundred gold. Five hundred steps closer to—\n\nHe SPREADS my cheeks now, really pulls them apart. The metal thong shifts, and I feel air hit places that—there's another squelch, wetter, and Snib's grin gets wider.\n\n\"Hear that? That's yer smoothie sayin' hello! Getting all—\"\n\nA sound escapes me. Something between a whimper and a keen, high and pathetic. I bite my tongue hard enough to taste copper but another comes anyway.\n\n\"That's it!\" His fingers dig DEEPER, spreading me wider. I can feel the string of the thong sawing against my... against... \"Sing fer me, hero! Let me hear what Aldric sounds like with his arse in me hands!\"\n\nMy legs shake. Everything shakes. This isn't happening. This can't be—\n\nOne finger traces the metal where it disappears between my cheeks. Follows it down to where—\n\n\"NO!\" I jerk forward, fall to my knees. My tits hit the wet floor with a *WHAP*.\n\nSnib just laughs. Laughs and laughs and laughs.\n\n\"Five hundred off!\" He announces, still cackling. \"Kept me word! Only nine thousand five hundred to go!\" He pauses. \"Well, after ye earn some, that is. But the POTENTIAL'S there!\"\n\nI stay on my knees, shaking. The place where his fingers were burns cold. Ghost sensations of being spread, handled, owned.\n\n\"Now—\" He kicks the bucket, sloshing water everywhere. \"Finish me floor! Want it so clean I can eat off it! And keep that arse up high—I'm enjoyin' the view I PAID for!\"\n\nI grab the rag with numb fingers. Start scrubbing. The floor's never been clean. Years of filth, decades maybe. And here I am, on my knees, tits dragging through dirty water, while a goblin watches my ass work.\n\n\"Oh, and hero?\" Snib's settled back on his furs, hand in his loincloth again. \"Almost forgot to ask—\"\n\nHe grins, showing all those broken teeth.\n\n\"What ARE ye?\"\n\n]The word comes out like a sword thrust. \"No.\"\n\nSnib's grin doesn't falter. If anything, it widens.\n\n\"No?\" He tastes the word like exotic wine. \"The great hero says NO to earnin' gold?\"\n\n\"I'm not inviting you to—\" My voice shakes with rage. \"I know your game, goblin. I won't play it.\"\n\n\"My game?\" He stands, walks around me as I kneel there, rag dripping dirty water. \"MY game is I own ye. Says so right on yer sword. Says so on that collar.\"\n\nThe leash materializes in his hand like smoke becoming iron. One moment nothing, the next—a chain of something that's not quite metal, not quite shadow. He loops it through a ring on the post I hadn't noticed before—a wooden stake driven deep into the floor's center.\n\n*CLINK.*\n\n\"There!\" He gives it a test tug. The collar jerks, making me gag. \"Now ye're properly situated! Like a good house-pet!\"\n\nThe leash is maybe six feet. Enough to move around the hut's interior. Not enough to reach the door. Not enough to GET anywhere.\n\n\"This is how we train stubborn hero-cunts!\" He settles back on his furs, hands behind his head. \"Ye clean from there. Show me how good ye can work while leashed!\"\n\nI try to stand. The armor makes it a production—tits swaying, ass jutting out as I find my balance in these spike-heels. The leash pulls taut when I try to reach the far corner with the broom.\n\n[Image: The leash pulls taut when I try to reach the far corner with the broom.\n\n\"HAH! Look at ye STRAAAAAAIN!\" Snib's cackling. \"All that reach and ye can't quite—oop! Almost! Try harder!\"\n\nI lean further. The collar digs into my throat. The corner's still two feet away. Have to sweep in arcs, pulling debris toward me instead of pushing it away. Every movement makes the chain rattle.\n\n\"Missed a spot!\" Snib points to the bucket. \"Right there! Where I sometimes leak at night!\"\n\nI have to get on my knees to reach it, crawling as far as the leash allows, ass high as I scrub.\n\n\"There's me girl! Crawlin' like ye're meant to!\" His hand's in his loincloth now. \"Bet yer wife never saw ye like this! The great Aldric, on a leash, scrubbin' goblin-juice off the floor!\"\n\nMy teeth grind. Scrub harder. The stain's not coming up—it's soaked into the wood grain.\n\n\"Use spit!\" He suggests brightly. \"Good for loosening dried gunk!\"\n\n\"I'm not—\"\n\n*YANK.*\n\nThe leash pulls me backward, making me sprawl. My ass lands hard, tits bouncing wildly.\n\n\"What's that? Couldn't hear ye over all that metal jinglin'!\"\n\nI get back on my knees. Keep scrubbing. The post forces me to move in circles, always tethered, always limited. Reach for the pile of bones—leash goes taut. Stretch toward the wall—collar chokes. Every task becomes a puzzle of angles and positioning.\n\n\"Should keep ye like this always!\" Snib's literally bouncing on his furs. \"Me own personal maid-pet! Could invite other goblins over—'Look what I got! The hero of Eboncrap, tied to me post!'\"\n\nAn hour passes. Maybe two. Time blurs into repetitive humiliation. Sweep what I can reach. Crawl to new position. Sweep again. The chain rattles constantly, a metallic reminder of my status.\n\n\"That collar's TRAININ' ye.\" Snib muses, now lying on his side, watching me like I'm the world's most fascinating theater. \"Every time ye pull against it, every time it chokes ye a little—that's it learnin' ye yer limits. Soon ye won't even TRY to go past where the leash ends.\"\n\nHe's right. I'm already unconsciously measuring my movements, staying within the circle. Not fighting the boundary.\n\n\"Just like breakin' a horse!\" He continues. \"First they fight. Then they learn the rope's length. Then they just... stop trying. And ye're already at step two!\"\n\n\"I am nothing like—\"\n\n\"Like a horse?\" He grins. \"Ye're right. Horses are useful from the start. Ye had to be CHANGED to be useful. Had to grow them milk-bags, that breeding-hole, all that soft grab-meat. The collar knew what it was doing!\"\n\nThe last corner needs cleaning—the one with Whisperwind.\n\nMy transformed sword lies there like a corpse at a wake. The dried cum has turned from yellow-white to brown crust, flaking off in places but thick as candle wax in others. The inscription—ELISE - GOBLIN-OWNED HERO—seems to mock me through the filth.\n\nI reach for it. The leash pulls taut just... just shy. My fingers brush the pommel but can't grip.\n\n\"Awwww, want yer sword?\" Snib's on his feet, waddling over. He kicks it just out of reach. \"There! Now ye REALLY can't touch it! HAHAHA!\"\n\nThe rage builds in my chest like molten iron. This tiny, worthless creature. This THING that should be ground under my boot. Has me leashed like a dog, cleaning his sty while he watches and laughs and—\n\n\"Look at that face!\" He's delighted. \"All red and furious! Know what? I'm gonna leave ye tied up while I nap. Let ye really THINK about yer position.\"\n\nHe yawns, stretches, flops onto his furs.\n\n\"Wake me when ye're ready to be a good girl.\" His eyes close. \"But probably not. This is too much fun!\"\n\nWithin minutes, he's snoring.\n\nI sit in the middle of the floor, leashed to a post in a goblin's hut, surrounded by the fruits of my labor.\n\nSix feet of movement. That's my world now. six feet from the post that owns me as surely as Snib does.\n\n[Choice: Use the broom to reach the sword...]The words stick in my throat like fishbones.\n\nMaybe... maybe this is his weakness. If I can burn through the debt fast enough, the collar might FORCE him to release me. Ten thousand becomes nine thousand becomes—\n\n*Don't think. Just do it.*\n\n\"M-Master Snib...\" The title tastes like ash. \"Will you... will you...\"\n\n\"Will I WHAT?\" He's delighted, cock visibly throbbing through his loincloth. \"Gotta say it proper!\"\n\nMy face burns. My whole body burns. I'm on my knees scrubbing his floor with my tits hanging and my ass up and—\n\n\"Will you... touch my...\" I can't. I physically cannot.\n\n\"Yer what? Yer big FAT...?\"\n\n\"My... my rear.\"\n\n\"REAR?\" He cackles. \"Call 'em what they are! Big wobbly SIT-MEAT! Arse-GLOBES! Say it!\"\n\nKill me. Eon kill me now.\n\n\"Will you... squeeze my... my big...\" The words are broken glass. \"My fat... sit-cushions.\"\n\n\"AHAHAHA! THAT'LL DO!\"\n\nHe's behind me before I can brace. His hands—rough, warty, disgustingly warm—sink into my ass cheeks like they're dough.\n\n\"It's like grabbin' CLOUDS!\" He SQUEEZES, hard enough that my flesh bulges between his fingers. \"So much MEAT! And ye ASKED ME!\"\n\nBoth hands now, kneading, pulling, spreading. I can FEEL my cheeks parting, cool air hitting places that should never feel air. My pussy—that smooth slit—exposed completely.\n\n\"Now WIGGLE 'em! Make 'em DANCE fer Master Snib!\"\n\n\"I—I can't—\"\n\n\"YE CAN!\" He spanks once, hard. **CRACK!** The sound echoes. \"Move them hips! Side to side!\"\n\nI do it.\n\nThe motion is... there's no comparison. When I had muscle there, tight warrior's glutes, moving my hips meant POWER. Meant combat stance, meant coiled strength. Now it's just... meat. Wobbling. My ass cheeks slap against each other with wet sounds—*plap-plap-plap*—independent of my will. They have their own momentum, continuing to jiggle after I stop moving.\n\n\"LOOK AT 'EM GO!\" Snib's hands follow the motion, riding the waves of flesh. \"Like pudding! Like two BIG PALE puddings just SLOSHIN' around!\"\n\n[Video]\n\nHe pulls them apart again. Wider this time. I can feel everything—the stretch, the exposure, his thumbs pressing into the soft inner flesh near my—\n\n\"Could fit me FACE in there!\" He's panting now. \"Could just BURY meself and—\"\n\n**SMACK!**\n\nHis palm cracks across my right cheek. The flesh ripples, a wave traveling from impact point outward. I watch over my shoulder as the jiggle takes three full seconds to settle.\n\n\"There!\" He steps back, breathing hard. \"Seven hundred fifty off yer debt! See? Master Snib keeps his word!\"\n\nI push myself up on shaking arms. My ass still tingles where he touched, where he spread, where he LOOKED.\n\n\"Now finish the floor,\" he orders, settling back on his furs. \"Want it SPOTLESS.\"\n\nThe scrubbing becomes mechanical. Plank by plank. The water in the bucket turns brown, then black. I dump it, refill from the well—walking naked through the desert again, feeling sun on every inch—bring it back.\n\nThe dirt sections need sweeping. I grab the broom, start pushing refuse into piles. But what's refuse and what's... his belongings?\n\n\"Master Snib?\" The title comes easier now. Horrifyingly easier. \"This... wooden soldier. Keep it?\"\n\n\"That? Nah, chuck it.\"\n\nI toss it out. Next item—a string of dried... something. Meat? \"This?\"\n\n\"OI! That's JERKY! Been aging for MONTHS!\" He snatches it, takes a bite. Grey meat tears between his teeth. \"Don't touch me FOOD!\"\n\nMore bones. More pottery shards. A woman's hair comb, teeth missing. My hands shake as I sweep it toward the door.\n\n\"Keep that!\" Snib calls. \"Might need it fer yer hair later.\"\n\nI shudder.\n\n\"Ye know...\" Snib's voice goes thoughtful. \"Yer workin' real hard. Real EAGER-like.\" He's rubbing himself through the loincloth again. *SCHLICK-SCHLICK.* \"Tell ye what. Hundred fifty gold if ye let me play with them UDDERS. Just a good squeeze. Maybe a pinch.\"\n\n]I keep scrubbing.\n\nThe rag moves in circles across the planks. Dirt lifts. Water darkens. My tits sway with each motion, my ass stays up, and Snib's laughter fills the hut.\n\n\"Stubborn bitch! Could be RICH by now!\" *SCHLICK-SCHLICK.* \"But no, got yer PRIDE! Fat lot of good that does ye on yer knees!\"\n\nI scrub harder. Get the corner clean, move to the next section. The wood actually has grain under all the filth—decent planking, probably stolen from traders like the roof.\n\nWhen the wet work's done, I stand. Everything jiggles into place. Snib's still leering, still stroking, but the moment's passed.\n\nI grab the broom again, start sweeping the dirt sections.\n\nActually... it DOES look better. Not clean—this place will never be clean—but better. Less like a midden, more like a place something almost-civilized could live. I sweep because I have to sleep here. Have to exist here until I earn my freedom.\n\nNot for him. For ME.\n\n\"What about this?\" I hold up something that looks like a dried... fruit? No, that's a shriveled—I don't want to know. \"Keep or throw?\"\n\n\"Keep! That's a lucky rat's paw!\"\n\n\"It has six toes.\"\n\n\"THAT'S what makes it lucky!\"\n\nI toss it in the keep pile. Move on to what looks like a broken cup. \"This?\"\n\n\"KEEP! I drink from that!\"\n\n\"It has no bottom.\"\n\n\"Drains FAST that way!\"\n\nNext item: a stick with something crusty on one end. \"This?\"\n\n\"Me back-scratcher! DEFINITELY keep!\"\n\nEverything's treasure to him. The broken, the filthy, the inexplicable. I sort through it anyway, making piles—actual refuse outside, \"valuables\" stacked near his furs.\n\n\"Ye look GOOD when ye work!\" Snib calls out, adjusting himself. \"All them jiggly bits bouncin' around! Should keep ye naked ALL the time! Hundred times better than clothes!\"\n\nI sweep the last corner. Dust billows out the door. The hut's... not good. But LIVABLE. Almost.\n\n\"Oi! Titty-meat!\" Snib sits up, grinning. \"Got another offer!\"\n\nI don't look at him. Keep sweeping.\n\n\"One hundred fifty gold—\" His voice pitches higher with excitement. \"If ye let me play with them fat milk-bags! Just fer a bit! Squeeze 'em, jiggle 'em, maybe give 'em a good SLAP!\"\n\nThe broom stops mid-sweep.\n\nOne hundred fifty. He LOWERED the price.\n\nLike I'm a merchant's goods that won't move. Like my degradation is going on SALE.",

I'll do it.\"\n\n\"Do WHAT?\" Snib's already moving, cock tenting his fresh loincloth. \"Gotta ask PROPER!\"\n\nKill me. Flux turn the wheel and kill me.\n\n\"Master Snib...\" My voice comes out tiny. \"Will you... play with my...\" I can't say it. \"My chest.\"\n\n\"CHEST?\" He's right behind me now, breath hot on my back. \"Ye mean them BIG SWINGING MILK-BAGS?\"\n\n\"Y-yes.\"\n\n\"ASK BETTER!\"\n\n\"Will you...\" I'm shaking. \"Will you squeeze my... my... tits.\"\n\n\"THERE WE GO!\"\n\n[Image: Those warty, rough hands slide up my ribs, then SINK into my tits from underneath.\n\nHis arms come around from behind. Those warty, rough hands slide up my ribs—I can feel every wart, every callus—then SINK into my tits from underneath.\n\n\"Must be ten pounds EACH!\" He hefts them, weighing them like sacks of grain.\n\nThey're not. Can't be. But when he lifts and drops them—watching them BOUNCE back into place with impacts I feel in my ribs—they might as well be boulders.\n\n*This isn't me. This isn't my body. Just meat. Just—*\n\nHe comes around to my front, still groping, those yellow eyes level with my tits. He looks UP at me, grinning with all those broken teeth, and pinches both nipples between thumb and finger.\n\n\"Look at me,\" he commands.\n\nI look down. Meet those yellow eyes.\n\n[Image: I look down. Meet those yellow eyes.\n\nHe TWISTS.\n\n\"AH!\"\n\nThe sound rips out of me—high, feminine, pathetic. He twists the other way, pulling my nipples out, stretching them until my whole tits deform into cones following his grip. Then he lets go.\n\n**WHAP-WOBBLE-WOBBLE**\n\nThey snap back, flesh rippling in waves that take three full seconds to settle. He watches it happen, mesmerized.\n\n\"AGAIN!\"\n\nHe grabs the nipples, pulls HARDER. I'm looking right into his eyes as he does it—seeing his delight, his OWNERSHIP, the way he's savoring every second of this. My tits stretch impossibly far, the skin going white at the pull points, then—\n\n**SLAP-WOBBLE-JIGGLE**\n\n\"Listen to 'em!\" He's cackling now, slapping the sides, watching them collide in the middle with meaty impacts.\n\n*WHAP-WHAP-WHAP*\n\nEach slap makes them swing in different directions, crashing into each other, the nipples still hard and scraped and burning from his twisting. I'm still looking into his eyes because looking away would be admitting this is happening, admitting that Aldric the Great is letting a goblin—\n\n\"Bet yer wife's tits are NOTHING compared to these!\" He grabs them both, SQUEEZES until flesh bulges between his fingers. \"Bet she'd be JEALOUS! Might have to show her later!\"\n\n\"There!\" He steps back, wiping his hands on his loincloth like he's been handling raw meat. \"Nine hundred gold off! See how EASY this can be?\"\n\nI stand there, tits still wobbling slightly from the assault, nipples screaming, dignity in pieces on the floor.\n\n\"Right then!\" Snib yawns, stretches. \"Time fer me afternoon nap. All this groping's tired me out!\"\n\nI reach for my armor—anything to cover myself, to pretend the last hour didn't happen. The metal triangles feel like protection even though they cover nothing. Click. Click. The chains dig into my shoulders. The thong vanishes between my ass cheeks where he SPREAD them, where he—\n\n*Stop.*\n\nAs I'm fastening the boots, Snib's hand shoots out. A leash materializes—dark, not-quite-leather, not-quite-metal—running from my collar to his fist.\n\n\"Where ye think YER going?\"\n\n\"I... nowhere. Just—\"\n\nHe ties the leash to the post in the middle of the room. I'm suddenly aware of how the length works—I can reach most of the hut, but not the door.\n\n\"There!\" He settles onto his furs. \"Don't want ye doing nothin' FUNNY while I sleep. Ye can clean more if ye want. Or just... sit there.\" Another yawn. \"Like a proper pet.\"\n\nWithin minutes, he's snoring.\n\nI stand in the center of the room, leashed like a dog, collar heavy on my throat. The chain's maybe eight feet—enough to move, not enough to matter. I pull at it experimentally. It doesn't budge. Doesn't even creak. Just... exists. Absolute.\n\nMy eyes drift to the corner.\n\nWhisperwind.]I turn away from him, sweeping the last corner. My arms cross my chest when I bend for the dustpan—an instinct that doesn't work. Too much flesh spills around my forearms anyway.\n\n\"Playin' hard to get!\" Snib laughs, but there's an edge now. \"Think yer tits are too good fer goblin hands? They AIN'T! Just fat sacks of meat waitin' to be squeezed!\"\n\nThe broom goes back in its corner. I keep my back to him, shoulders hunched. Can feel his eyes on my ass, on the curve of my spine, on everything.\n\n\"Hmph.\" His fur pile rustles as he shifts. \"Look at this place. Still looks like shit.\"\n\nI bite my tongue. It's CLEAN. Cleaner than it's ever been no doubt.\n\n\"Them bones I wanted ARRANGED, not just tossed!\" He yawns, stretching. \"But I s'pose ye did... adequate. Fer a fat-titted humie who can't follow simple orders.\"\n\n*Adequate.*\n\nSeventeen years of hero work. And now I'm *adequate* at sweeping goblin shit.\n\n\"Since ye worked SO HARD—\" His voice drips sarcasm. \"Ye can have some free time. Clean that sword of yers if ye want. Looks like someone jerked off all over it! HARHARHAR!\"\n\nMy hands clench.\n\n\"Gonna take a nap now.\" More creaking as he settles into his newly-arranged furs. \"All this watchin' ye prance around made me tired. Them bounce-bags are hypnotizin'!\"\n\nTaking this as dismissal, I move toward my armor. The metal triangles wait in the sand where I dropped them. Freedom from his eyes, at least partial coverage of—\n\n\"Where ye think yer goin', titty-slave?\"\n\nI freeze, one hand reaching for the bikini top.\n\n\"Can't have ye wanderin' off or doin' somethin' stupid while I sleep.\" His hand rises lazily, fingers grasping air.\n\nThe collar tightens—not painfully, just enough to remind me it's there. Then something materializes from it: a leash. Dark metal links that might be leather, might be iron, might be shadow given form. It extends from my throat to his hand in one liquid motion.\n\n\"There we go!\"\n\nHe loops it around the center post. Ties it. The leash goes taut when I step back, maybe six feet of length total.\n\n\"Perfect! Now ye can play in yer corner like a good pet!\" He rolls over, already drowsing. \"Don't make too much noise. Master needs his beauty sleep after watchin' all that ASS-MEAT wobble around...\"\n\nHis snores start within seconds. Wet, rattling things that sound like drowning.\n\nI stand there, naked, leashed to a post like livestock.\n\nThe armor's just within reach. I grab the bikini top first, have to lean against the leash's pull to get it. The metal's cold from lying in sand, makes my nipples tighten on contact. Getting it on while tethered is its own humiliation—I can't move freely, have to work around the chain's limitations.\n\n*Click.* One triangle secured. *Click.* The second.\n\nThe thong next. Step in, pull up, feel it disappear between my ass cheeks with that wet sound that makes me want to scream. The boots last—those fucking spike-heels that turn walking into controlled falling.\n\nDressed. If you can call this dressed.\n\nI give the leash an experimental tug. It holds fast, the knot somehow tightening when pulled. The material feels wrong under my fingers—too warm for metal, too rigid for leather. Like it exists specifically to hold heroes-turned-slaves.\n\nWhisperwind waits in the corner, still crusted with dried cum that's gone flaky. Just within reach if I stretch the leash taut.\n\nSnib snores on, one hand down his fresh loincloth even in sleep.\n\nThis is my \"free time.\" Leashed like an animal while a goblin sleeps off his arousal.\n\n*At least I can clean the blade.*\"...How long?\"\n\nThe words come out small. Defeated.\n\n\"Just a bit! Few squeezes! Won't take but a moment!\" Snib's already scrambling off his furs, cock tenting his fresh loincloth. \"But ye gotta ASK proper! Like before!\"\n\nI close my eyes. The broom handle creaks in my grip.\n\n*One hundred fifty. Now you're considering one-fifty of the stupid fake debt. It's all a game, but...*\n\n\"Master Snib...\" My voice catches. These words shouldn't exist. \"Will you... will you please...\"\n\n\"Go on!\" He's bouncing on his heels, three-foot-eight of green excitement.\n\n\"Touch my...\" I can't say it. \"...chest.\"\n\n\"CHEST?\" He cackles. \"That ain't what they are! Try again! And look at me when ye ask!\"\n\nI open my eyes. Meet his yellow gaze. He's grinning so wide I can see all his broken teeth.\n\n\"Master Snib, will you please... touch my...\" The word sits like poison on my tongue. \"...tits.\"\n\nHe's on me before I can brace.\n\nHis hands come from behind first—reaching around my waist, then sliding UP. Small, warty fingers find the undersides of my breasts and LIFT. The weight of them fills his palms, overflowing. He hefts them like testing fruit at market, bouncing them, weighing them.\n\n\"FUCK me, these are HEAVY!\" His breath's hot on my lower back—he's so SHORT his face is level with my spine. \"Like holdin' water-skins! But WARM! And the skin's so SOFT!\"\n\nHe squeezes. His fingers sink into the flesh like it's dough, leaving pale marks when he adjusts his grip. I stare straight ahead at the wall, at those smallclothes trophies, trying to think about anything but the goblin hands kneading my—\n\n\"Let's see the front!\"\n\nHe scuttles around, has to reach UP to keep hold. Now we're face to... stomach. He has to crane his neck to look at my face, but his eyes stay locked on his prizes. Both hands working, squeezing, lifting, DROPPING them to watch them bounce back into place.\n\n\"Like hittin' butter-bags!\" He slaps the left one from underneath. It jumps, jiggles, settles. Then the right.\n\n*This is happening. You ASKED for this to happen.*\n\nHis fingers find my nipples.\n\n\"These little pink things!\" He pinches them between thumb and forefinger, not hard enough to truly hurt but enough to make me gasp. \"Like little pebbles! But watch—\"\n\nHe TWISTS.\n\nNot violent, but firm. Deliberate. My nipples harden further under his touch, standing out like accusations. He pulls them, watching my breasts follow, creating peaks before letting them snap back.\n\n\"Pull 'em and the whole tit follows!\"\n\nHe does it again. Pull. Release. Pull. Release. My breasts dance to his rhythm, and I'm looking down at him, at this creature who killed maybe three humans in his whole life while I've slaughtered HUNDREDS of his kind, and he's playing with my tits like he owns them.\n\nBecause he does.\n\n\"The mighty Aldric,\" he says, still pulling my nipples, staring up into my eyes with pure malicious joy.\n\nHe gives one last SQUEEZE—both hands, HARD, making me yelp—then steps back, wiping his hands on his loincloth.\n\n\"Worth every copper of that discount!\" He yawns, huge and theatrical. \"All that touchin' made me tired. Gonna have a nap.\"\n\nHe waddles to his furs, but stops. Turns. That grin again.\n\n\"Actually... don't want ye gettin' IDEAS while I sleep.\"\n\nHis hand extends. The leash materializes—dark quasi-metal, not quite solid, not quite smoke. It snaps to my collar with a sound like breaking bones. He loops the other end around the center post.\n\n\"There! Now ye can move around but not too far. Like a proper pet!\"\n\nThe leash gives me maybe six feet of movement. Enough to reach my armor. Enough to get to—\n\nWhisperwind. Still in the corner. Still covered in dried cum.\n\n\"Sweet dreams, tit-slave!\" Snib collapses onto his furs, asleep almost instantly. His snores fill the hut within seconds.\n\nI'm alone. Tied to a post like a dog. My nipples still ache from his fingers. The ghost of his hands still burns on my breasts.\n\nTime to get dressed. Time to remember who I'm supposed to be.\n\nThe armor sits in the sand where I dropped it. I pull on the bottom first—the metal thong sliding back between my ass cheeks with practiced humiliation. Then the top, wrestling my tits back into the triangular prisons. They barely fit after being handled, nipples still hard, scraping against metal with each breath.\n\nThe boots last. My feet scream as they're forced back into that pointed angle.\n\nDressed. If you can call it that.\n\n[Choice: Try to clean Whisperwind.",

Oh that's—that's PRECIOUS!\"\n\nHe scrambles up, still giggling, wipes tears from his yellow eyes.\n\n\"Tell ye what, ALDRIC—\" He emphasizes the name like it's the punchiest of punchlines. \"Since yer still a hero and all, ye need proper hero treatment!

The leash materializes from smoke—not rope, not leather, something that shifts between solid and shadow, dark metal links that weren't there and now ARE.\n\n\"Up! Stand up!\"\n\nI push myself to standing. Everything jiggles into place. My knees are red from the floor, tits wet from dragging through dirty water.\n\n\"Perfect!\" He grabs the leash, yanks me toward the center of the room where a wooden post rises from floor to roof—probably the only thing keeping this shit-heap standing. \"Right here!\"\n\nHe wraps the leash around the post three times, each loop making a sound like metal on bone. When he lets go, I try to step back—the leash goes taut at maybe four feet.\n\n\"There!\" He looks so PROUD of himself. \"Now ye can't wander off! Can't get into trouble! Just like a proper—\" He pauses, grins wider, \"—like a proper pet!\"\n\n[Image: I pull at the collar. The leash doesn't budge.\n\nI pull at the collar. The leash doesn't budge.

Picks it up with both hands—has to strain, the blade's still heavy even corrupted—and drops it JUST out of my reach.\n\n*CLANG*\n\nA few feet away. I lunge for it—the leash snaps taut, collar digging into my throat. My fingertips are maybe six inches short.\n\n\"HARHARHAR!\"\n\nI try again. Same result.

Got me clothes washed, hut cleaned, breakfast cooked, even got to play with that bounce-meat proper!\"\n\nHe collapses onto his furs, already pulling his loincloth aside to get comfortable.

Stay asleep, you little shit.\n\nThe broom catches on the pommel. I pull. The sword scrapes across the dirt floor, each inch gained feeling like a small victory. When it's finally close enough, ]I crouch—tits hanging heavy, swaying—and stare at what's been done to my blade.\n\nThe cum has dried into geological layers. The outer crust, yellowed like old parchment, cracks and flakes where it's thickest. Underneath, I can see glossier patches where it's still tacky, and at the deepest points near the fuller—\n\nIt's still WET. Still glistening. Like it just happened.\n\nThe smell hits when I lean closer. Pure... MUSK. Concentrated goblin essence. It floods my sinuses, makes my head swim like I've stood up too fast. A shimmer rises off the blade. My nipples tighten against the metal triangles.\n\n*No. Focus.*\n\nThe first scrape peels away a sheet of dried seed thick as leather. It comes off in one piece, revealing more underneath. Layer after layer. How much did he—\n\nThe inscription shows through: ELISE - GOBLIN-OWNED HERO. The letters face away from the grip. When planted, others read it. Not me. It's not FOR me.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I whisper to the blade. My voice cracks. \"Whisperwind, I'm so fucking sorry.\"\n\n[Image: The knife works at the worst patches. Scrape. Peel.\nThe knife works at the worst patches. Scrape. Peel. The sound it makes—like removing scabs. Some parts require sawing, the cum has formed actual ROPES between the crossguard and blade. They stretch when pulled, elastic, before snapping with wet sounds.\n\nDeeper layers reveal themselves. Here it's not yellow but pearl-white, almost luminous. Still warm somehow. Still ALIVE. When I chip at it, it clings to the knife, stretches in strings I have to cut.\n\nThe smell intensifies. My thighs press together involuntarily. Something low in my belly clenches—\n\n*Stop.*\n\nI pour water from the bucket, watch it run over the blade. The cum doesn't dissolve. It has to be scraped, peeled, CUT away. Like it's bonded to the metal. Like it's claimed it.\n\nThe grip is worst. His seed worked into every wrap of the dragonskin, soaked deep. I scrub with the rag but it just spreads the wetness around. The texture under my fingers—slick, wrong, almost warm—\n\nA sound escapes me. High. Breathy. I bite my tongue hard enough to taste copper.\n\nThe blade itself has changed. Where skyforged steel once shimmered, now it's the purple-black of a bruise. The wind runes are gone, replaced by symbols that hurt to read. They pulse faintly, like veins.\n\nBut it's still Whisperwind. Still mine. Changed like I'm changed, corrupted like I'm corrupted, but MINE.\n\nTwenty minutes of scraping. Peeling. Cutting away corruption. The pile of dried cum beside me looks like shed snakeskin, if snakes shed in ropes and chunks. My hands shake from gripping the knife so tight. My face burns from leaning too close to that MUSK.\n\n[Image: gif]\nFinally—FINALLY—the worst is gone. The blade's still stained, but I can hold the grip without touching seed.\n\nI stand, Whisperwind in hand. The weight's all wrong. Too light. Balanced for these smaller hands. When I try a practice swing, it moves like it's underwater. No song. Just dead air.\n\nMy bladder suddenly reminds me it exists.\n\nAll that well water. All that scrubbing. It presses urgent and undeniable. I look at the door—can't reach. Look at the corner—can't reach. The leash holds me to maybe five feet from the post in any direction.\n\nThe bucket sits there. Empty except for dirty water and cum-flakes.\n\n*No.*\n\nBut the pressure builds. My thighs squeeze together—different reason now. This soft body doesn't hold it like Aldric's did. Everything's more urgent, more immediate.\n\nI test Whisperwind's edge against the leash. The shadow-metal doesn't even notice the blade. Like cutting smoke. The sword passes through without resistance, without effect.\n\nBut what if...\n\nWhat if I cut the POST?\n\nThe wood's old. Worn. Probably half-rotten. If I can saw through it, collapse this whole section, maybe—\n\nMy bladder throbs again. Soon I won't have a choice.\n\nSnib snorts in his sleep, rolls over. His cock flops out of his loincloth completely, purple head glistening with fresh precum even while unconscious.\n\n[Minigame]",

These heel-boots force my calves into permanent tension, ankles locked at an angle that makes a proper stance impossible. When I spread my legs for stability, my thighs burn immediately. The armor clinks—always fucking clinking—and my tits shift with their own momentum, pulling my center of gravity forward.\n\nA man's body plants itself. A woman's... wobbles.\n\nI grip Whisperwind two-handed. The corrupted pommel fits my smaller palms perfectly now, like the blade WANTS these hands. First position—high guard. My arms come up and these fucking udders are immediately in the way, pressing against my forearms, forcing my elbows out wider than they should be.\n\nLower guard then. I drop the blade horizontal at hip height. Better. The weight's wrong—too light, balanced for quick slashes rather than power strikes—but I can work with this.\n\nThe target: that water-stained section eight inches from the floor. One clean cut.

My hands tighten on the grip.\n\nI breathe. Once. Twice.\n\nOn the third breath, I move.\n\nThe blade comes around in a perfect arc—not a wild swing but controlled violence. My hips rotate first, then shoulders, then arms, everything flowing like water despite the heels trying to topple me. The corrupted blade sings—not its old song but something darker, hungrier.\n\n*THUNK*\n\nWhisperwind bites through pine like it's parchment. The cut so clean the post doesn't even shift for a heartbeat. Then—slowly—it tilts. The top section slides sideways with a whisper, hits the floor with a dull thud.\n\nThe leash goes slack. The weight of the post-top drags at my collar but it's FREE. I'm—\n\nSnib snorts. Rolls over.\n\nMy heart hammers. I freeze, Whisperwind still extended in follow-through position.\n\nHe mumbles something in Goblish—\"thrack-meat\"—and his hand fumbles at his cock. Gives it two sleepy strokes. Then the snoring resumes, somehow wetter than before.\n\nI let out the breath I didn't know I was holding.\n\nThe bladder-pressure returns, urgent now. I step toward the door, dragging the post-top behind me. It scrapes once on the floor. I freeze again. Snib doesn't stir.\n\n[Choice: Leave the hut.]The strike comes down clean—\n\n*THUNK*\n\nThe blade buries maybe two inches. The post doesn't even shake.\n\nLow guard. Come at it from the angle, where the grain splits. I pull back, readjust, these fucking udders swaying with each movement. The second strike—\n\n*THUNK*\n\nAnother two inches. Different spot. The post stands solid as castle stone.\n\n\"What in the—\"\n\nI grab the grip with both hands, plant my heel-spike, and PULL. The blade doesn't budge. I adjust my stance—ass out for leverage, tits compressed between my arms—and yank harder.\n\nNothing.\n\n\"HEHEHEHE—what's all this then?\"\n\nMy blood freezes. Snib's awake, propped on one elbow, watching me struggle.\n\n\"Tryin' to cut yer way free?\" He yawns, showing all those broken teeth. \"With them noodle arms? HAH!\"\n\nI pull harder, face burning. The sword's stuck deep, the soft wood closing around it like a wound.\n\n\"Look at ye! Probably can't even lift a full ale pot now!\" He's sitting up fully, cock already tenting his loincloth from watching me struggle. \"Them's lady muscles now! Soft! Weak! Good fer nothin' but jigglin'!\"\n\nMy hands slip. I stumble back, the leash snapping taut, keeping me from falling but making my tits bounce violently.\n\n\"Please—\" The word burns coming out. \"I need—Master Snib, I need the privy.\"\n\n\"Privy?\" He scratches his balls, grinning wider. \"What's wrong with right here?\"\n\n\"I need to go outside to—\"\n\n\"Bucket.\"\n\nThe filthy bucket I just used for cleaning. Sitting right there in the middle of his hut.\n\n\"I can't—not in—\"\n\n\"Sure ye can! Squat right over it! Give us a show!\" He settles back on his furs, both hands behind his head now. \"Bet ye never pissed as a girl before! This'll be EDUCATIONAL!\"\n\nMy face burns so hot it hurts. But the pressure is getting unbearable. This soft body doesn't hold it like—\n\n\"Come on then! Unless ye'd rather water me floor?\"\n\nI position myself over the bucket. Have to spread my legs wide to clear it. The armor barely covers anything in this position—the thong disappears completely between my ass cheeks, my pussy lips probably visible from behind.\n\n\"That's it! Squat like ye're birthin'!\" Snib's moved for a better view, sitting cross-legged right behind me. \"Look at them thighs shake! And that smoothie peekin' out!\"\n\nI lower myself. These heels make it impossible to balance properly. My thighs burn. My tits hang heavy, nearly hitting the bucket rim. Everything's wrong. The angle, the position, the lack of anything to AIM with—\n\n\"What's the hold-up?\" Snib reaches out, SLAPS my ass. The flesh jiggles for three full seconds. \"Just let it flow! Like openin' a tap!\"\n\nBut I can't.\n\nThe muscles—everything's different. I don't know HOW. And with him watching, breathing on my exposed ass, making comments—\n\n[Image: The muscles—everything's different.\n\n\"Need help?\"\n\n\"NO!\"\n\n\"Then GET ON WITH IT!\"\n\nI close my eyes. Try to relax muscles I don't understand. The pressure's overwhelming but nothing happens. Just this burning need and the inability to—\n\n\"Hehehehe!

Sweet Flux's teeth, they're like having two saddlebags strapped to my ribs. When I raise the blade to high guard, shoulder position, my forearms crush against them. The metal triangles dig in, scales biting... nipple. I adjust wider, elbows flared like a crow's wings. Ugly but ecessary.\n\nThird: these thrakking heels. These platforms keep me from sinking but force my weight forward onto the balls of my feet. My calves already burn from the morning's work. Every stance needs to be wider, lower, or I'll topple.\n\n*Begin.*\n\nFirst form. I step back-diagonal, platform heel dragging a furrow. The blade comes up outside my chest instead of center. When I cut down, the arc is narrower, tighter. Less power but the motion doesn't collide with soft flesh.\n\nThe wrath stroke. Diagonal down. My hips turn harder than they should—no, that's not right. They turn DIFFERENTLY. This pelvis spans wider than my old shoulders did, hip bones flaring out like the yoke of an ox cart. When I try to rotate for the cut, it's not the tight coil of a warrior's torso anymore. It's this sweeping, grinding arc that starts somewhere deep in my belly and ripples outward.\n\nThe bones themselves are set at angles that make my thighs cant inward even when I'm trying to stand straight. When I pivot, these wide-set bones force my whole lower body to follow a broader path, like trying to turn a wagon instead of a riding horse.\n\nThe momentum comes from below, not above. When the blade stops, my tits keep going, bounce-settling a heartbeat later.\n\nReset. Try again. This time I WAIT for them to settle before moving. Cut. Pause. Breathe. Cut. Pause. It's like fighting underwater, every motion delayed, reconsidered.\n\nHalf-sword grip—maybe close work is better. My left hand finds the blade's middle, careful of the edge. This brings everything tighter to my body. A thrust from the plow guard. My chest forces my elbows wide, but the shortened grip compensates.\n\nThe desert wind picks up, throwing sand against my exposed skin. It should sting, but this skin seems made for desert heat, drinking in the sun that would blister even Aldric's hardened flesh.\n\nFootwork next. The box pattern, four cardinal directions. But in these heels, every step is a controlled fall. Toe first, platform sliding, never stabbing down. My ass—there's so MUCH of it—shifts with each movement, its own counterweight. When I pivot, it swings wide, forcing me to adjust or tumble.\n\nFourth form—Serpent Coils. Close-in binding work where opponents' blades lock and wrestle. But when I try to bring my arms across for the entanglement, my tits are completely in the way. I can't get the proper angle. Can't—\n\n*Adapt.*\n\nI drop the bind lower, working below chest height. My thighs burn from the sustained squat but it WORKS. The blade snakes around an imaginary opponent's guard, creating the opening. From here, a pommel strike to the phantom's jaw, using the lower stance to drive upward with my legs.\n\nSweat runs between my tits, down my belly, pooling where the metal thong sits at my hips. The afternoon sun starting to set. Each breath tastes of heat and sand.\n\nNext I try a square—six cuts describing a box around an opponent. But modified. The horizontal cuts can't cross my chest, so I make them shorter, snappier, all wrist and forearm. The rising cuts use hip rotation, that mill wheel pelvis grinding around to generate power the shoulders can't provide.\n\nBy the seventh form variation, I'm panting. These tits heave with each breath. Sweat makes the metal slick. My thighs tremble from holding the lower stances. But I can feel it—a new rhythm emerging. Not Aldric's economical violence but something more... fluid. Serpentine.\n\nI feel ambitious. A full spin-cut. I need to know if—\n\nI gather, inhale, and SPIN.\n\nFor one perfect moment, I'm flying. The blade describes a perfect circle, the desert blurs, my body moves as one piece despite all its wrong weights and wobbles. I can feel it working, the momentum carrying through, the—\n\nThe platform heel hits a soft patch.\n\nMy ankle rolls. The spin becomes a stumble. My tits fly one way, my ass the other. The blade goes wide. I try to recover but the heels won't let me, and suddenly I'm falling forward, arms windmilling, Whisperwind flying from my grip—\n\n*WHUMPF*\n\nFace-first into sand. My tits hit first, actually BOUNCING me before I complete the face-plant. Sand in my mouth, my nose, my eyes. The armor jingles mockingly as I lie there, ass up, face down, looking like I'm presenting myself to the desert.\n\n\"HARHARHARHARHAR!\"\n\nSnib's right there. Of course he is. Standing in the doorway, cock tenting his fresh loincloth, tears streaming down his warty face from laughing so hard.\n\n\"LOOK AT YE! EATING SAND WITH YER TITS OUT!\"\n\nI struggle to my knees. Sand cascades from my cleavage.\n\n\"How long—\"\n\n\"Long enough to see them milk-bags try to fly away! HARHAR! Swingin' that sword like ye're churning butter!\" He waddles closer. \"Ye looked like ye were fightin' yerself more than any enemy!\"",

The tit-slave's givin' me the evil eye!\" He clutches his chest in mock terror. \"What ye gonna do, bounce at me threateningly?

Not gentle. GRAB and YANK.\n\nMy scalp explodes with pain. He hauls backward with both hands, using the black silk like fucking reins. My head snaps back, neck arching, these massive tits thrust forward as my spine bows.\n\n\"AAHH—\"\n\nThe sound that tears from my throat—high, breathy, pathetic. Not a warrior's grunt. A woman's yelp. My hands fly to my head, trying to ease the pressure, but he just pulls HARDER, dragging me upward from my knees.\n\nFor a heartbeat I'm suspended—ass still on my heels, upper body pulled backward, every muscle straining. Then he YANKS again and my ass lifts, knees coming off the sand, forced to scramble upright or have my hair ripped from my skull.\n\n[Image: left]\nMy legs won't cooperate fast enough. These heels slip in sand. One knee, then the other. I'm scrambling, whimpering, hands still clutching at his grip while he just HOLDS THERE, three feet of warty goblin muscle using my hair to puppet this whole soft body into whatever position he wants.\n\n\"UP, COW-TITS!\" His voice right behind my ear. Hot breath on my neck. \"Stop rollin' in the dirt like a fuckin' sow.\"\n\nAnother yank. My vision whites at the edges. My mouth drops open—I'm PANTING. Why am I panting? It's just hair, just—\n\nBut it's not just hair. It's the fact that he can DO this. Can grab and yank and move me however he wants. My body understands before my mind does: *this creature owns you.*\n\n\"Cleaned me jizz off yer sword, did ye?\" He's pulling me backward now, walking me like a horse on a lead. Every step I take, he tugs just slightly, REMINDING me. \"Scraped off all them nut-ropes? Good little maid?\"\n\n\"Let—\" My voice cracks. \"Let go—\"\n\n\"Plenty more where that came from!\" He LAUGHS, right against the back of my neck. His free hand grabs my ass—not a slap, a GRIP. Fingers sinking deep into soft flesh, CLAIMING it. \"Gonna paint this blade again. And again. Till ye stop pretendin' yer anything but me property.\"\n\nHe releases both—hair and ass—and I stumble forward, catching myself on shaking legs.\n\nBut it's already happened. That thing I can't name. That dropping sensation that starts behind my navel and spreads like spilled honey, making everything below my waist feel... soft. Open. Waiting.\n\nMy throat's tight but my mouth is wet. My skin prickles but I'm suddenly, inexplicably HOT. Not blushing—deeper. A furnace lighting in my belly that has nothing to do with the desert sun.\n\n*No. Fuck no. Not from THIS.*\n\nBut I can feel it. The way my thighs want to press together—not from shame, from something worse. The way my breath won't steady. The way every hair on my body stands at attention like tiny soldiers saluting their conqueror.\n\nThe way my nipples have gone so hard they're practically drilling through the metal triangles.\n\nHe didn't touch them. Didn't touch between my legs. Just grabbed my HAIR. Just moved me where he wanted. And my body—this fucking TRAITOR meat—responded like he'd—\n\n[Image: Stop thinking about it. Just stop.\n\n*Stop thinking about it. Just stop.*\n\nBut I can't. Because he's wadding closer again, and I can SMELL him now. That concentrated goblin smell that shouldn't do anything but repulse me. Except my nostrils are flaring. Except I'm drawing it DEEPER.\n\n\"Now.\" Snib's stomach gurgles audibly. \"That plant-mush from morning ain't stickin'. Need MEAT. Real meat. Something that bleeds when ye bite it!\"\n\nHe scratches his balls through the loincloth, considering.\n\n\"Ye're gonna hunt. But PROPER this time. Not just picking berries like some Tel-wife.\" He spits in the sand. \"Desert's full of meat if ye know where to look. I'm usually eatin' carrion.\"\n\nI brush sand from my face. As much as I hate to admit it, I'm hungry too.\n\nOr, does my transformation make me crave what my little 'Master' requests? \"Then I need a bow.\"\n\n\"Don't got one!\" He says. \"Make it. Bendy stick, stretchy string, pointy sticks. How hard can it be?\"\n\n*Very hard, actually.*\n\nBut there might be materials. Perhaps that desert yucca near the well... and the hut's full of leather scraps that could work for string. Arrows though... thrack.\n\n\"The sun's already setting.\"\n\n\"Then what ye waitin' for?\" Snib kicks sand at me. \"Want me meat!\"\n\nI look around Snib's compound.

      "text": "I'm lucky, for once.\n\nThe dead olive tree has a living shoot at its base—green wood, finger-thick, about four feet long. Still flexible. I saw at it with the knife until it comes free, already bending into a natural curve.\n\nString is the real problem. No time to cure sinew properly—that takes days. But there—Snib's pile of \"trophies,\" which I had to dust and lay out. There's a leather bodice, still supple despite the desert heat.\n\nI cut it into strips with the knife, working fast.\n\n\"Oi! That's me favorite!\" Snib protests. \"Belonged to a miller's daughter with the BIGGEST—\"\n\n\"Are you planning to wear it?\" I snap, sawing another strip.\n\nHe opens his mouth. Closes it. Looks down at his pot belly and the cock that won't stay in his loincloth.\n\n\"...ye owe me another one!\"\n\nI soak two laces in water from the bucket. Stretch them between my hands, working out the give. Then twist—hard, opposite directions in each hand until the leather wants to coil on itself. Let it fold back, become two-ply cord. The twist locks tight, stronger than braiding.\n\nI notch both ends of the green wood with the knife, shallow cuts. Wrap each notch with thin rawhide thread I cut from the bodice's stays—keeps the wood from splitting under tension. String it while the wood's still moist, then hold the whole contraption near the dying cook-fire embers. The leather shrinks as it dries, pulling tighter. Less stretch on the first shot.\n\nThe draw weight's pathetic—maybe twenty pounds if I'm generous. But it only needs to work once.\n\nArrows. The pottery shards by the wall are sharp enough. I split three straight twigs from the olive tree, each about two feet long.\n\nBut I need to fletch them, and feathers do not number among the refuse around the hut.\n\nFur? The scraps from Snib's old kills are too matted, too stiff. I need something light, something that catches air but doesn't add weight.\n\nA strand of my own hair falls across my vision as I crouch there, thinking.\n\nLong, silky black hair that the collar gave me. There's so fucking MUCH of it.\n\nI grab the knife, reach back, find a section near the nape. Start sawing.\n\n\"What ye doin'?\" Snib waddles closer, watching with interest.\n\n\"Fletching.\" The hair comes free in a thick bundle—maybe forty strands wound together.\n\n\"HARHAR! Cuttin' yer pretty hair! Gonna look like a moth-chewed rug!\"\n\nI ignore him, too focused. Tie the bundle into a single tuft at the back end of each arrow shaft, leaving it loose to drag and slow the spin. It's not proper, but it's better than nothing.\n\nTwo more cuts. Two more tufts. Three arrows with trailing black hair, looking like crude ceremonial pieces.\n\n\"Looks ridiculous!\" Snib announces. \"Yer gonna hunt with sticks that got yer hair danglin' off 'em! HARHARHAR!\"\n\n\"It'll work.\"\n\nThree arrows. One bow that might last ten shots. About an hour of work, all in all.\n\n*CLOP-CLOP* across the sand. The bow feels wrong in hands too small, arms too short. But I know where to look.\n\nThe rockpile near the well. I crouch—everything jiggles—twenty paces away. Far enough they won't spook. Close enough for this child's toy of a bow.\n\nWait.\n\nThe sun drops lower. Shadows lengthen. There—movement. A sand-colored ear. Then the whole hare, emerging for evening forage. It's thin, ribs showing through patchy fur.\n\nI draw. The leather creaks dangerously. My tits force my elbow out at an ugly angle. Sight down the arrow—no proper fletching means it'll fly wild, but at this distance...\n\nRelease.\n\nThe arrow goes wide by a foot. The hare freezes. Second arrow already nocked. Draw. Compensate for the bow's weakness, for these tits in the way, for—\n\n*THWPP*\n\n[Image: Desert hare, stringy but it's meat.\nThe pottery shard takes it in the side. Not a clean kill. The hare screams—that horrible sound they make—and tries to run, but just drags itself in a circle.\n\nI have to finish it with the knife.\n\nIt's small. Maybe two pounds of meat once dressed. But it's MEAT.\n\nBack at the hut, I gut it quickly. Save the heart and liver—best nutrition. The hide comes off in one piece with practice. Now I need—\n\nSnib snatches it from my hands.\n\n\"Thrackin' finally!\"\n\nHe doesn't even wait. Just BITES into the raw flesh, tearing with those broken teeth. Blood runs down his chin. The sound—wet, ripping, chunks of raw meat getting gulped down without chewing.\n\n\"Mmmmph—GOOD!\" He talks through the mouthful. \"FRESH meat!\"\n\nI stand there watching him devour MY kill. The liver goes down in two bites. He cracks the tiny bones with his teeth, sucks out the marrow. Even gnaws the skull open for the brain.\n\nWithin three minutes, nothing's left but scraps of fur and a red stain on his hands.\n\n\"Ahhhhh!\" He belches, patting his distended belly. \"THAT'S eating! Not like that plant-mush this morning!\"\n\nHe tosses me a leg bone with a few shreds of meat still clinging.\n\n[Choice: Cook it.",

I have to lift each heavy globe—still can't think of them as MINE—to find the mechanisms. My fingers are shaking. From exhaustion. From the day. From—\n\n*Click.*\n\nThe first triangle springs free. My tit drops with a wet *slap* against my ribs. There's a line pressed into the flesh where the metal sat, angry red against pale skin.\n\n*Click.*\n\n[Image: The nipples—Flux's teeth, they're so HARD.\n\nBoth free now. They hang like overripe fruit, the nipples—Flux's teeth, they're so HARD. Have been for hours. Dark pink, almost purple, standing out like accusations.\n\nOutside, sand-owls call their three-note songs. A desert fox yips in the distance. The normal sounds of night that used to comfort me on watch. Now they just emphasize how fucking WRONG everything is.\n\nThe thong next. I reach for the clasp at my spine, have to twist, everything jiggles. When I pull the metal away from between my legs—\n\n*Oh.*\n\nA string. A fucking STRING of... of me. Clear, viscous, stretching from the metal to my—to the smooth lips down there. It catches in the light of the coals, glistening obscene, refusing to break even as I pull the thong further away. Two feet. Three. Finally snaps with a wet sound that makes me want to die.\n\n[Image: Clear, viscous, stretching from the metal to my—to the smooth lips down there.\n\nWhen my boots come off, my feet actually thank me, toes spreading in the dirt. But I catch myself in Whisperwind's blade—the reflection warped by the corruption but still clear enough.\n\nI don't look as dirty as I should.\n\n[Image: right]\nThat's the worst part. After a day of scrubbing floors, washing goblin cum-rags, hunting in the desert—my skin GLOWS. Luminous. Like I've been bathed in temple oils. My hair falls in waves that catch light like black silk. Even the sweat between my tits looks like dew on marble.\n\nMy green eyes—the last sign of Aldric—stare back from a face too soft, too beautiful. Cheekbones high and delicate. Lips full and naturally flushed like I've been eating berries. But it's the expression that kills me. Lost. Confused.... HUNGRY.\n\nThe smell hits when I spread my legs slightly to stand—that honeyed perfume my body makes, stronger now, mixing with something earthier. Musk. Female musk that even I recognize as arousal. The night jasmine note has gone indolic, rotting-sweet, broadcasting my state to anything with nostrils.\n\nMy inner thighs are... slick. Not wet. SLICK. Like oil. When they touch, they slip past each other with no friction.\n\nI plant Whisperwind in the dirt, the inscription facing away. Use the blade like a mirror while I lower myself onto the straw. Everything's throbbing. Not just down there—though Eon's bones, the PULSE between my legs is like a second heartbeat—but everywhere. My nipples ache. My belly clenches in rhythms I don't understand. Even my lips feel swollen, sensitive.\n\nThis is what women feel? This crawling NEED under the skin? This emptiness that demands filling? Or is this something about my specific curse?\n\nCleaning his floor on hands and knees. Tied to a post like livestock. Fed scraps of my own kill. Every humiliation adding to this building pressure that has nowhere to go except—\n\nMy hand drifts to my belly. The skin's so soft. No hair, no muscle, just smooth warmth that trembles under my touch. Lower. The hipbones that flare so wide, the dip between them leading to—\n\n[Image: left]\nI touch myself.\n\nJust the lightest brush of fingertips against those smooth lips and my whole body jerks. The sensation shoots up my spine, makes my tits bounce, forces a sound from my throat that I muffle with my other hand.\n\nIn Whisperwind's reflection, I see myself—legs spread, one hand between them, the other over my mouth, tits heaving. The flush has spread from my cheeks down my neck, across my chest. Even my tits are flushed, pink-tinged like dawn.\n\nAnother touch. This time finding that little nub at the top—the only thing I recognize, though it's different, more exposed, more—\n\n*\"Nnngh—\"*\n\nI bite my hand to keep quiet. Snib's still snoring but I can't—can't make sounds like that. High, desperate, FEMININE sounds.",

The motion makes my ass cheeks shift against each other, makes the straw scratch new places, makes my pussy lips—those puffy, swollen things—slide against my knuckle.\n\n\"Nnnnh—\"\n\nI bite down on my wrist. HARD. Teeth marks in soft flesh. But the pain doesn't override the heat. It just... adds to it.]There's no stopping this.\n\nMy fingers find that little nub again, more exposed, practically THROBBING. When I press it, my whole lower body clenches. Thighs. Ass. That hungry mouth between my legs.\n\n[Image: There's no stopping this. Not with how I feel.\n\nI need a better angle. Roll onto my side—no, tits stack wrong. Try my back—they fall into my armpits, the weight pulling at chest muscles. Finally settle on all fours, face in the straw, ass up like a bitch in heat.\n\n[Image: The position makes everything worse. Better. Both.\nMy knees spread wider without permission. The cool air hits wet places. So WET. Like my body's weeping for something. The emptiness between my legs isn't just absence—it's PRESENCE. A hollow ache that pulses with my heartbeat.\n\nFree hand goes to my tit. Grab it. SQUEEZE. The flesh overflows between my fingers, soft as bread dough but heavier. Find the nipple—hard as a river stone—and pinch. Lightning shoots straight to my cunt.\n\n*Cunt.* That's what it is. Not pussy, not sex, just... cunt. Hungry wet cunt that's making my thighs slip against each other.\n\nMy knuckle presses harder against that swollen nub. Circles. The sensation builds like forge-fire, starting low and spreading. My hips start moving—grinding. My pelvis rocks forward and back, that wide hipbone rotating, making my ass bounce, making everything between my legs DRAG across my hand.\n\n\"Mmmmph—th- thrack—\"\n\nStraw in my mouth. I'm biting the bedding to keep quiet. My hair falls around my face in black curtains, sticking to sweat. Everything's sweat. Between my tits. Small of my back. That crease where thigh meets pelvis.\n\nI explore lower. Those lips down there are THICK. Swollen. When I spread them—Flux's teeth, they're so slippery—there's this heat that pours out. Temperature difference. My cunt's FEVER-hot inside.\n\n[Image: Those lips down there are THICK. Swollen.\n\nThe entrance. That's the worst part. Best part. That ring of muscle that keeps clenching on nothing, trying to GRAB something that isn't there. I press one fingertip against it and my whole body shudders.\n\n*Don't. Don't put anything inside. That's—*\n\nBut my body WANTS. Every nerve screaming for fullness. For stretching. For—\n\nMy knuckle slips. Just the tip of one finger slides in and I almost scream.\n\nIt's nothing like having a cock. When I was hard, the pleasure was focused, directional, aimed. This is EVERYWHERE. The walls inside—they're textured, ridged, and they GRIP. They pull.\n\nI yank my finger out. Can't. Won't. That's too much like accepting this.\n\nBack to the outside. That little nub is so swollen now it's pushed out from its hood. Every brush makes my thighs shake. Makes my tits swing. Makes sounds escape that I've only heard from tavern whores through thin walls.\n\n\"Uhh—uhh—p- please—\"\n\nThe pressure building in my belly, behind my pelvis, everywhere and nowhere. Not focused like male orgasm building in the balls. This is whole-body preparation for something massive.\n\nMy ass is so high now. Presenting.\n\n*Stop thinking. Just—*\n\nAnother circle of my knuckle and my cunt CLENCHES. Empty. So fucking empty. The muscles inside spasm, trying to milk something that should be there. My body knows what it wants even if my mind won't accept it.\n\n[Image: My thighs are soaked.\n\nFluid drips. Actual DRIPS onto the straw. The smell fills the air. My thighs are soaked. When they rub together, there's no friction, just slick flesh sliding.\n\nI'm making sounds now. Can't help it. High, desperate whimpers muffled by straw and my own wrist. The collar jingles with each rock of my hips. My tits swing heavy, nipples dragging across rough straw, sending more lightning to my cunt.\n\nSo close to—something. Not like before. Not like the focused explosion of male orgasm. This is building toward something that feels like it might turn me inside out. Might break whatever's left of Aldric and leave only—\n\nThe pressure. The NEED. My cunt clutching at air. My whole body drawn tight as bowstring, ready to—\n\n[Image: *Almost there. Almost—*\n\n[Choice: Suddenly...",

My fingers are still BURIED knuckle-deep in this sopping mess between my legs, this hungry mouth that won't stop SUCKING at them, pulling them deeper. I should stop. Pull them out. Cover myself. But when I try, my pussy CLENCHES like it's afraid of being empty, and another wave of that crawling heat races up my spine.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Look at ye! Arse up like a bitch in season, fingers in yer own cunt, tits danglin' like—FUCK—like udders ready for milkin'!\"\n\nI flip onto my back—bad idea. TERRIBLE idea. My tits keep moving for three full seconds after I stop, sloshing into each other with a wet CLAP that makes me moan. Can't help it. The sound just RIPS out of me, high and broken, while my fingers are still—why are they still MOVING?\n\n[Image: The voice cuts through my fog like ice water.\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*\n\nThat's him. Not me. HIM. Standing over me now, that purple-headed MONSTER swaying between his legs like a drooling war-club. Twelve inches of goblin breeding-meat, the head flared wide as my fist, angry purple-red like a bruise. The piss-slit keeps FLEXING—opening and closing like it's trying to speak—and each time it does, another rope of precum oozes out. Not drops. ROPES. Thick as honey but clouded white-yellow, stretching down... down... one breaks and SPLATS on the straw near my face.\n\nThe smell hits like a physical slap. Concentrated ball-rot mixed with something that makes my sinuses BURN but also makes my pussy—this TRAITOROUS FUCKING HOLE—squeeze my fingers so hard I gasp.\n\n\"Can't stop, can ye?\" Snib squats beside me, and his cock SWINGS with the motion, describing an arc that ends three inches from my face. THREE. INCHES. Close enough that I can see each ridge, each vein pulsing with goblin blood, the way the foreskin's pulled back just enough to show where smegma's collected in white crescents around the crown. \"Been givin' in all day! Touched yer tits fer gold! Begged me to grab that fat arse!\"\n\n\"I'm not—nnngh—not begging for—\"\n\nMy hips roll. Like my body's trying to fuck my own hand. The motion makes my ass cheeks spread and close, makes my tits JUDDER, makes wet sounds that echo in the quiet hut.\n\n\"Tell ye what, hero-cunt.\"\n\nHis cock hangs like a gallows, pointed at my face. I can see everything—the veins thick as earthworms, the slit at the tip opening and closing like it's breathing... A pearl of *something* swells, stretches, threatens to drop directly onto my cheek.\n\n\"Ye want gold, right? To buy yer freedom?\"\n\nMy eyes track that precum drop. Can't look away. It's getting bigger, going from pearl to grape, the strand connecting it to his cock stretching thinner. My mouth floods with spit that I have to swallow. Why is my mouth—\n\n\"So let's make it interesting.\" His yellow eyes gleam. \"Little wagers. Little games. Ye WIN, I knock gold off yer debt. Lots o' gold.\"\n\n*Why can't I THRAKKING STOP???*\n\nMy fingers are still moving. Circling that swollen nub that sends lightning through my belly. The pressure's building again, that whole-body tension that threatens to turn me inside-out, and his STENCH—concentrated pheromone-musk that makes my brain swim—just makes it worse.\n\n\"Hmm. Ta start. Hundred gold off if ye can keep yer fingers in that smoothie while ye take THREE BIG SNIFFS of me cock!\" He grins, showing all those broken teeth. \"Bet ye can't! Cause ya can't even now.\"\n\nA hundred gold. That's... that's something. My brain tries to do math but keeps getting interrupted by the PULSE between my legs. Just breathing. I breathe on battlefields. Through smoke. Through blood. Through—\n\n[Image: right]\n\"Unless ye're too SCARED?\" He shifts closer. His cock BOUNCES with the movement. The head's gone darker purple, almost black at the edges, and the whole thing THROBS in time with his heartbeat. I can SEE his heartbeat in the way the veins bulge and relax, bulge and relax.\n\n\"I'm not—\" My voice cracks. High. Feminine. WEAK. \"Not scared of—\"\n\n\"Then DO IT!\" He grabs his cock at the base—his hand barely fits around it—and ANGLES it toward my face. \"Three big sniffs! While keepin' them fingers buried in that hungry cunt!\"\n\nThe head hovers there. Waiting. The piss-slit GAPES at me, showing pink inside, wet and wrong. A fresh bubble of precum wells up and I watch it grow in slow motion, watch the surface tension stretch, watch it catch the firelight and gleam before it DROPS—\n\n*splat*\n\nRight on my cheek. Hot. Hotter than should be possible. And thick enough that it doesn't run—just SITS there, cooling against my skin while my whole body goes rigid.\n\n\"Just three big sniffs!\" He flexes his cock and another drop of precum wells up. \"Right from the source! But ye gotta keep fingerin' that hungry hole the whole time, or ye lose!\"\n\n\"You're... disgusting...\" But my voice comes out breathy. High. My fingers are STILL moving inside me, these little circular motions I can't seem to get control of.\n\n\"So ye forfeit? No gold?\" He starts to pull back.\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\nA hundred gold. That's... that's real progress. That's A HUNDREDTH of my freedom just for BREATHING. My pussy contracts HARD on my fingers at the thought, more juice running out, pooling under my ass in the straw.\n\n\"I'll...\" My throat is so dry. \"I'll do it.\"\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Knew ye would! Greedy little hero-slut!\"\n\n\"Remember—three big sniffs! And keep them fingers movin' in that sloppy cunt!\"\n\nI force my fingers to keep their rhythm. The wet sounds are so loud in the quiet night—*squish-squish-squish*. My other hand's still at my tit, pinching the nipple between thumb and finger. When did I start doing that?\n\n[Choice: Take your first sniff.][Choice: Image: The voice cuts through my fog like ice water.\n\n\"Knew it.\"\n\nThe voice cuts through my fog like ice water.\n\nMy body freezes—hand still between my legs, ass still in the air, tits still swinging from momentum. Every muscle locks except the ones I can't control, the ones that keep CLENCHING, keep pulsing, keep begging for what was almost there.\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*\n\nThat sound. That wet, meaty sound of goblin hand on goblin cock.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Look at ye! Arse up like a bitch in season, fingers in yer own cunt, tits danglin' like—FUCK—like udders ready for milkin'!\"\n\nA sob breaks from my throat. Not a moan. A SOB. Because I can HEAR how wet I am. Can hear my pussy making sounds as it clenches on nothing, little wet squelches that match the rhythm of—\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*\n\n\"Knew ye'd break tonight!\" Snib's voice is thick, slurred with lust. \"Said ye almost came just from me touchin' that fat arse!\"\n\n\"No—I wasn't—\" My voice cracks high and pathetic.\n\n\"LIAR!\" He laughs, and I hear him spit. I hear him coming closer, perching in the straw near me.\n\n\"Yer smoothie's so wet it's SHININ'! Look at them lips—all fat and open! Look at that little button all swollen out!\"\n\nMy head swims. The pheromones from his precum mixing with my own scent, creating something that makes my pussy TWEAK harder, makes more fluid leak out, makes the emptiness SCREAM.\n\n\"That's it! Smell that cock, hero-cunt! Smell what's gonna own ye!\"\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*\n\nFaster now. Wetter. I can hear how much he's leaking, that thick precum splattering on his belly, on his furs, the smell getting STRONGER.\n\n\"How would yer WIFE like seein' ye on all fours like this?\" He's panting.\n\nElara. Oh Flux, ELARA—\n\n\"Her big strong husband, fingers in her own cunt, ass in the air, BEGGIN' for it!\"\n\n\"I'm not—I'm NOT—\" But the denial dies because my hips just ROLLED again. Involuntary. Grinding my pussy against my knuckle because the pressure—the NEED—\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*\n\n\"Finish it!\" His voice cracks. \"Go on! Shove them fingers in! SHOW ME how the hero cums!\"\n\nMy hand shakes between my legs. Everything throbs. My clit—that's what it is, what I have to call it—pulses so hard I can feel each heartbeat in it. The ring of muscle at my entrance keeps GRABBING at nothing, pulling inward, trying to swallow air.\n\nI'm so close. So fucking CLOSE. Just one more circle, and this will be over.\n\n\"DO IT!\" Snib roars. \"Cum fer yer Master! Show me what that hero-cunt can DO!\"\n\nThe smell. His cock-reek filling the air, mixing with my honey-jasmine-musk, creating something that bypasses my brain entirely and talks straight to my WOMB.\n\nMy fingers twitch. So close to moving. So close to finishing what—\n\n[Minigame]",

But the collar tightens—not choking, just a cold reminder.\n\n\"Said LOOK!\"\n\nMy head turns. Through tear-blurred vision and black hair stuck to my face with sweat, I see it. His cock. That purple-headed monstrosity, fist-thick and ANGRY, the head flared like a war mushroom. His warty hand pumps it so fast it blurs.\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*\n\n\"NO—don't cum yet!\" He barks. \"Cum when I cum! Together!

I won't—I CAN'T watch him—\n\n[Image: I hear (but don't see) the mess he's making...\n\nThe SOUND. Wet. Heavy. Something hitting the wall with force enough to make it audible across the room. My whole body jerks at the noise.\n\nMore. Each one accompanied by his guttural grunts. I keep my eyes SHUT, biting down on my wrist hard enough to break skin, but the sounds paint pictures I don't want—thick strands firing, splattering, running down—\n\n\"GRAAAHHH! TAKE IT! FUCKIN'—TAKE—IT—ALL!\"\n\nThe SMELL hits. That concentrated smell flooding the hut, so thick it has TEXTURE in my nostrils. My mouth floods with saliva. My pussy—\n\nNO—\n\nBut something in my brain just... BREAKS.\n\nMy pussy DETONATES.\n\n[Image: My pussy DETONATES.\n\n\"AAAHHH—FUCK—FUCK—NOOO!\"\n\nIt starts in my clit—no, BEHIND it, deeper, some organ I didn't know existed. The first wave hits like a hammer to the spine. My cunt CLENCHES so hard it hurts, the muscles spasming, trying to milk something that isn't there.\n\nThen the GUSH.\n\nNot just wetness—an actual SPRAY that hits my hand, my wrist, splatters the straw. I'm SQUIRTING, something I didn't know this body could do, clear fluid jetting out with each pulse.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! LOOK AT HER GO! SQUIRTIN' LIKE A FOUNTAIN!\"\n\nMy whole body convulses. Back arching so hard my tits SLAP my chin. Ass cheeks clenching, releasing, CLAPPING together. The orgasm doesn't peak and fade—it ROLLS, wave after wave, each one making me squirt again.\n\n*GUSH—splash—GUSH—splash*\n\n\"The great Aldric! SQUIRTIN' HER BRAINS OUT! Wait'll I tell the Gobboree!\"\n\nI'm SCREAMING now. Not moaning. SCREAMING. High, feminine wails that don't sound human. My legs kick out, heels drumming the floor. My free hand claws at the straw, tearing it, needing something to hold while my body tears itself apart with pleasure.\n\n\"PLEASE—STOP—CAN'T—\"\n\nBut it won't stop. Each pulse makes my vision white out. Makes my tits bounce so hard they hurt. Makes more fluid GUSH from my cunt like I'm pissing myself but it's not piss, it's something else, something that smells like honey and shame.\n\nMy pussy's making sounds. I can't think. Can only FEEL as my body betrays everything I was, turning me into this writhing, squirting THING on the floor. The orgasm goes deeper than physical—it's rewriting something fundamental, burning pathways into my brain that shouldn't exist.\n\nFinally—FINALLY—it starts to fade. But even the aftershocks make me squirt little spurts. My whole lower body spasms randomly, puppet strings cut.\n\nI collapse face-first into the soaked straw. The puddle under me is... extensive. Everything from my knees to my belly is drenched. The smell of my arousal so thick it's visible in the firelight.\n\nTears run down my face, mixing with drool, with sweat, with the shame of knowing that just *hear* HIM cum triggered the most intense orgasm of either of my lives.\n\nI sob into the straw, my pussy still twitching, still drooling, still empty, while his cum runs down the wall and my dignity runs down my thighs.\n\n\"From now on,\" Snib says, settling back into his furs, \"when ye need to cum, ye ask. And ye do it where I can watch. That's an ORDER from yer master.\"\n\nI can't respond. Can't think. My brain feels like it's been turned inside out and wrung dry. Everything between my legs THROBS in time with my heartbeat. The puddle under me is cooling, getting sticky, reminding me with every breath what just happened.\n\nAldric the Great just came like a bitch in heat from watching a goblin jack off.\n\nAnd somewhere deep in my belly, despite the shame, despite the horror—\n\nSomething clenches. Wanting more.[[Image: My hand RIPS away from my cunt like it's been burned.\n\nMy hand RIPS away from my cunt like it's been burned.\n\n\"No—NO!\" The word tears from my throat, half sob, half snarl. I curl into a ball, knees to chest—these fucking tits compress between my thighs—arms wrapped around myself like armor that doesn't exist anymore.\n\n\"Awww, what's wrong?\" Snib's voice drips mockery. \"Too PROUD to cum? Too much of a HERO?\"\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*\n\nFaster. Wetter. The sound fills the hut. I squeeze my eyes shut, press my face into the straw, but I can HEAR everything. His breathing getting ragged. The wet slap of his balls. The—\n\nThe sound of impact. Wet. Heavy. Then more—\n\n\"Dumb BITCH!\"\n\n[Image: The emptiness between my legs feels like starvation, like dying of thirst while hearing water.\n\nHis grunts echo off the walls. The smell hits seconds later—concentrated musk so thick my mouth waters against my will. My pussy THROBS like a wound. The emptiness between my legs feels like starvation, like dying of thirst while hearing water.\n\nBecause everything between my legs is SCREAMING. Not just the clit—everything. The muscles inside clench over and over, trying to finish what I started. My thighs are so slick they slide against each other. The pressure in my belly feels like it might split me open.\n\n\"From now on,\" Snib wheezes through his post-orgasm high, \"ye cum when I SAY. IF I say. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe next sennight. Maybe NEVER.\"\n\nA sob escapes. An actual sob because I can feel it—the orgasm that was RIGHT THERE, retreating like a tide going out, leaving me empty and RAW.\n\n\"And when ye DO get to cum—if ye're VERY good—it'll be on my terms. While I tell ye EXACTLY how.\"\n\nI'm shaking. Full-body trembles that make everything jiggle. Not from cold. From NEED. From the horrible realization that my body is already addicted to something I haven't even done.\n\nI curl tighter, trying to ignore the pulse between my legs, the wetness that won't stop, the empty ACHE that feels like dying. My clit throbs so hard it hurts. My nipples scrape against my arms, sending little shocks straight to my cunt.\n\nThis is torture.\n\nThe straw scratches my oversensitive skin. Every shift makes my thighs slide together, makes my pussy clench, makes the need WORSE. I'm going to lie here all night like this. Feeling everything. Unable to stop it. Unable to finish it.\n\n\"One day,\" Snib yawns, already drifting off, \"ye'll BEG me. Properly.\"\n\nHis snores fill the hut within minutes.\n\nI lie there shaking, my pussy drooling onto the straw, the smell of my own cunt mixing with his cum-stench, creating something that makes my head spin. Everything throbs. Everything aches. Everything wants.\n\nAnd I can't do anything about it.\n\n[Choice: Sleep...",

Everything's different, arranged wrong, nothing works the way I remember. I push, but nothing. Relax, but nothing.\n\nMy thighs burn from the squat. The bucket rim presses cold against the backs of my thighs. Everything's exposed—ass out, pussy hanging over empty air, tits weighing me forward. The thong pulled aside so roughly the metal digs into one ass cheek.\n\n*Come on. Just—*\n\nA few drops finally escape. Hot. Spattering into the bucket with sounds so quiet they're barely there. Not a stream—just... leaking.\n\nMore drops. Dribbling. I can't CONTROL it. Can't aim, can't direct, can't do anything but crouch here and hope gravity does the work. The sound is nothing like—\n\nNothing like what I'm used to. What I remember. That confident rush, that ability to write your name in snow if you wanted, to extinguish campfires...\n\nFinally something like a stream starts. Thin. Making soft spattering sounds in the bucket. It trickles forward, pools, I have to shift my weight back or it'll—\n\n\"HARHARHAR!\"\n\nI open my eyes. Snib's standing right there. Right between my spread thighs. Yellow eyes locked on mine.\n\n\"That's adorable,\" he says, reaching down to loosen his loincloth. \"That little dribble.\"\n\n\"Don't—\" My stream stops from the tension. \"Don't watch me—\"\n\n\"I'm gonna SHOW ye how it's done.\"\n\nHis loincloth drops. That massive purple cock flops out, already thickening just from watching me squat here. He grabs it with both hands—needs both hands to aim that fucking battering ram—and steps closer.\n\nI try to move back but the leash snaps taut. Try to close my legs but the bucket's there. Try to stand but my calves are locked, burning. I'm TRAPPED in this squat while he positions his cock directly between my spread thighs.\n\n\"This—\" He grabs it with one warty hand, aims it down between my thighs, \"—is how a GOBBO pisses, bitch.\"\n\n[Image: 'This is how a GOBBO pisses, bitch!'\nNot a hiss. A ROAR. His piss hammers into the bucket with such force I hear the metal RING. Finger-thick. Directed. CONTROLLED. The sound drowns out everything—a torrent, a waterfall, a fucking DELUGE of hot goblin piss that makes my soft trickle seem like nothing.\n\nHe's HOSING the bucket. I watch the yellow stream arc between my thighs—so close I feel the heat radiating—watch it POUND the water I barely managed to trickle out. His stream is so powerful it's SPLASHING, droplets hitting my inner thighs, my pussy, mixing with the weak flow that's still leaking from me.\n\n\"Look at the DIFFERENCE!\" He's grinning, those yellow eyes boring into mine. \"Yer little girl-piddle versus a REAL stream!\"\n\nI'm frozen. Can't move. The leash keeps me here, squatting, while he stands OVER me, his cock jutting between my spread thighs, pissing with the force of a warhorse.\n\nSteam coils up between my legs, carrying that concentrated reek—sharp, animal, MALE. My nostrils flare. My head swims.\n\nThe bucket's nearly full. But he's not stopping. He shifts his aim slightly—the stream angles, splashes—\n\nHot droplets hit my inner thighs.\n\n\"OOP! Clumsy me!\" He grins, deliberately letting his stream waver, spattering my skin. \"Hard to aim when yer packing this much meat!\"\n\nI flinch but can't move. The leash. The position.

It hammers down for another ten seconds, then drops to a steady pour, then finally a few spurts.\n\nHe shakes. Droplets fly.\n\n\"There!\" He tucks himself back into his loincloth. \"That's how it's DONE! Ye got any left in ye, or did watching a REAL pisser make ye forget how?\"\n\nMy face burns so hot I might combust. The comparison—the CONTRAST—\n\nI was a man. I could piss standing. Could aim. Could—\n\n\"Nothin' to say?\" He circles behind me, slaps my ass. \"Course not. What's there to say? Ye piss like a girl cause ye ARE one! And girls don't piss—they LEAK!\"\n\nMy eyes burn. Not from ammonia fumes.\n\nFrom the truth of it.\n\n[Choice: But worse—much worse—is what happens next.",

      "text": "[Image: It does disgust me. But underneath the disgust, my body floods with heat.\n\nThe bucket sits there between my feet, half-full of mixed piss—his powerful yellow torrent diluting my pathetic trickle. The comparison makes something die inside me. But underneath that death, in the soft meat between my hips, something... tightens. Coils. Like a fist clenching in reverse.\n\nI pull the metal thong back into place with shaking fingers. It immediately saws back between my cheeks like it never left, but now it's—the metal's warm. Slick. From more than sweat.\n\n*No.*\n\nStand slowly. My legs aren't just trembling from the squat anymore. There's this... ache that starts low in my belly and spreads downward like spilled honey. My nipples have gone so hard they actually hurt against the metal triangles, peaked into points that scrape with each breath.\n\nI reach for the bucket handle. Have to carry his piss out. His PISS. This little green nothing who should be sword-fodder, who I've killed hundreds of—and I'm carrying his waste like a chamber maid. The thought should disgust me.\n\nLifting the bucket, I feel the weight of it. His stream was so heavy, so forceful, it actually has HEFT. The yellow swirls with my clear contribution like—like he conquered my piss too. Marked it. Made it his.\n\nMy scalp prickles. Every hair follicle tightening. That's... that's just anger. Has to be.\n\nBut when I turn toward the door, my thighs slip against each other. Just slightly. Just enough to notice the... the wetness that wasn't there before. My cunt—that word arrives unbidden, crude and direct—my cunt is responding to this display like a fucking animal in heat. To being shown what REAL pissing looks like. What a MALE can do that I can't anymore.\n\n*Think about Elara.*\n\nBut trying to picture my wife just makes it worse. Because Elara never saw me squat and dribble. Never saw me get out-pissed by a creature she'd scrape off her boot. The shame should kill the feeling. Instead it feeds it. Makes that tight coiling in my pelvis twist harder.\n\nEach step toward the door, the bucket sloshes. His piss. I'm literally carrying goblin piss in my hands while my pussy—\n\n*Stop.*\n\nBut I can't stop. The feeling. This soft body with its soft responses. The way watching him stand there, cock out, marking his territory with that biological weapon between his legs made me feel so fundamentally FEMALE. So absolutely conquered without him even touching me.\n\nThe worst part is how my body knew what it was before my mind did. This warmth spreading through my belly, this tightness, this ache—it's arousal. Not mental. Not voluntary. It comes from being dominated by something that shouldn't even register as male to a hero.\n\nBut it does register. In every soft place this body has. In the way my breath comes shorter. In the way my skin feels too tight. In the way I want to squeeze my thighs together to stop the feeling but that just makes it WORSE.\n\nSnib's already waddle-strutting toward his furs, scratching his ass. Oblivious to how he just made my body respond. Or maybe not oblivious. Maybe he knows exactly what that display does to my cursed biology. To soft, weak, pathetic responses that I can't control, can't fight, can't do anything about except carry his piss out and pretend I'm not—\n\nThe word arrives like a slap: *wet.*\n\n\"Ye done waterworks?\" He plops down, belly full from the meal I cooked. \"Good. Cause I'm still HUNGRY. That plant-mush ye made? Fills the belly but don't SATISFY, ye know?\"\n\nHe makes exaggerated chewing motions, lips smacking.\n\n\"Need MEAT. Real meat. Something that bleeds proper when ye bite into it.\" His yellow eyes fix on me. \"Yer gonna hunt.\"\n\nI stare at him. \"Hunt. With what?\"\n\n\"With whatever ye MAKE, stupid cow!\" He waves dismissively at the desert beyond his hut. \"Desert's full of creatures if ye got eyes. Lizards, hares, maybe even a fat quail if yer lucky!\"\n\n\"I need—\" The words taste like defeat. \"I need a bow. Arrows.\"\n\n\"So MAKE one!\" He picks his teeth with a fingernail. \"Bendy stick, some string, pointy sticks fer arrows. How hard can it be fer a mighty HERO?\" He drags out the last word mockingly.\n\nMy jaw clenches. \"It's almost sunset. I need—\"\n\n\"Then MOVE that jiggly arse!\" He kicks his foot in my direction. \"I want meat by dark! And make it GOOD meat, not some scrawny rat!\"\n\nI look around his compound. The dead olive tree might have branches flexible enough. Leather scraps from his pile of refuse could work as string if I braid them. Arrows... fuck, arrows will be harder.\n\nThe setting sun paints everything rust-red. Desert hunting at dusk. In this body. In these fucking heels.\n\n\"Well?\" Snib's watching me, grinning. \"What ye waitin' fer? Permission to BREATHE? Move them udders!\"\n\n[Choice: Search for materials.",

My hefty breasts bouncing and coated in the splashback, my nubile butt bobbling with every move, makes Snib chuckle ominously.\n\n\"Elise my sweet, why don't ye make yerself useful,\" Snib laughs, sitting back against the hut. His putrid goblin dick-free of that foul loincloth- stood proud and throbbing in the morning air. His words crush my hope for solace. He leers at me, a grotesque smile of crude suggestion appearing on his lips.\n\n\"Look at this,\" he croaks, tapping his fat goblin schlong. \"It's aching, swollen, like a bad tooth.\"\n\nRevulsion swells within me like bile at his suggestion, yet a tinge of curiosity pokes amidst the disgust. It is accompanied by the realization that a goblin's sexual fantasies often come with a heavy dose of bargaining.\n\n\"See,) I was jokin' about the 10 gold before,\" Snib continues, ignoring my violated expressions, \"you give me a nice handjob while I lay here, and I'll knock off **500 gold** from the grand total.\" His hideous grin broadens at the sight of my mortified face, my stormy eyes sparkling with both resentment and reluctant consideration.\n\nThe idea is vile, yet twisted with a perverse sense of fairness.\n\n\"You'd get practice with this big fella,\" Snib adds as an afterthought, giving his monstrous schlong a playful waggle. A gag threatens to spill from my throat as the veiny beast salutes me ominously. It takes every ounce of control to suppress it. Though the precious gold on offer is not a favor, but more of a reprieve from the tedious debt, his twisted proposal toys with my sanity.\n\nIt seems like he’s not planning to rape me - even though he could by using the collar to compel me - he’d rather wear me down.\n\nThe thought of my hand grazing against his fleshy monstrosity sends despair crashing down on me. It's a chilling reminder of the chain around my neck, the leash of my existence controlled by a grotesque goblin with a stupid, perverted sense of humor!\n\n[Choice: Back to the hut...",

      "text": "As we return to Snib's hovel, my heart sinks deeper with each step towards the decrepit dwelling. The door creaks open, sending a shiver down my spine as it exposes the filth within.\n\nSnib roughly jerks my leash, instructing, \"Start cleaning up this mess, cow.\" My leash is then tied to a pole in the middle of the hut, giving me just enough slack to move around but nowhere near enough to feel free. The iron clinks softly as I test the limits, each jangle a shrill reminder of my constraints.\n\nThe sight that greets me is a chilling reminder of how far I've fallen. The hut is cluttered with remnants of goblin filth—bones from indistinguishable creatures, shreds of old, rotten food strewn about, and the acrid, stinking residue of semen that seems to permeate every corner.\n\nMy stomach churns.\n\nI long for the fresh floral scents of Elara's garden back in Eboncrest, her delicate fingers nurturing life into the soil.\n\nShe must be so worried right now. I'm supposed to be home. Enjoying a nice morning in with my wife!\n\nWith a heavy heart, I set about the demeaning task.\n\nI bend awkwardly to scoop up scattered bones, the arch of my back accentuating my absurd curves, tits dangling down. My once powerful hero's physique, replaced by this hyper-feminine body, jiggles and sways as I shuffle around, providing an unsolicited show.\n\nFrom his corner, Snib leers, \"Just look at those jiggling udders sway! Shake 'em more!\"\n\nI try to ignore him. On the brink of dozing off, he half-heartedly strokes his monstrous goblin cock. Lazy strings of precum ooze from the tip as he yawns.\n\nThe humiliation burns hotter with each swing of my oversized breasts and the tugging feel of the bikini armor, scraping uncomfortably with every forced movement. I recall Elara’s tender care, her worry over the smallest scrape I'd bring back from my adventures, and here I am, adorned in nothing but scraps of metal and shame, the object of a filthy monster's amusement.\n\nWhen I get to the middle of the room, a particular task freezes me in place. Whisperwind lies on the floor, partially covered in a dreadful mass of dried, congealed goblin-sperm. It's a monstrous sight, the sperm mass still ominously potent-looking, as if it could spring to life and impregnate me.\n\nThe brain-fogging stench it emits makes me miss the outdoors intensely, a setting I once roamed freely, respected and admired. Now, reduced to this... cleaning up after a goblin in humiliating attire, choking on the memory of what I once was.\n\nTears sting my eyes as I avert my gaze from Whisperwind. I can't bring myself to touch it, the weapon I had wielded with pride, now debased like me, reduced to an object in a goblin's vile game.\n\n\"Get a move on, Elise!” Snib barks, breaking me from my reverie. “Me eyes ain't pleased yet. Make sure you get every spot), or it's another spankin'!\"\n\nAs the day recklessly loses itself within the parched desert horizon, I find myself lost within a pressing question – how can I get through today?\n\nDespite this grim uncertainty, I know two things. Firstly, there's an unending heap of utter filth that needs cleaning. Secondly, there's a goblin who's unnecessarily amused by my discomfort from it.\n\nEverywhere around me, there's filth. At first glance, the chaotic jumble of debris seems like an intimidating dragon I would have otherwise slain with my sword. But I'm not Aldric the Great anymore. I am Elise, a voluptuous woman, held on a leash by a vile goblin named Snib - tasked to vanquish the beast with nothing more than a twig broom, a small tin bucket, and an old rag.\n\nI start by sweeping the hard dirt floor, a cloud of dust immediately engulfing the congested hut. Each stroke of the broom against the cold floor sends a chill up to my chest, the strain making my colossal tits bounce inside the restrictive metal bra. The feeling is bizarre, my large orbs marvelously jiggling with every breath I take, their warmth standing stark against the rest of my exposed body.\n\nSnib watches with interest, his beady eyes focused on the rhythmic jostle of my large, soft breasts. Grotesque fascination is written all over his face, a sickening grin plastered onto his frog-like lips. His unyielding stare fuels a dangerous knot in the pit of my stomach, my anger simmering with every passing moment, yet I persist in my domestic chore, my will unwavering.\n\nOver the hours, I pick up every bit of detritus, inspecting everything from discarded bones to the crushed remnants of indistinguishable inscriptions written in a bizarre script. Each item holds its morbid tale, their ghostly echoes adding to the haunting orchestra created by Snib’s entertainment at my expense.\n\nSoon, Snib grows restless and hands me a crude knife, pointing at a pile of food he had scavenged. Not wanting to give him any cause to yank my leash, I set to prepare the lunch. To my surprise, the creature he has brought back is much alike to the field rabbits back home. Familiarity stirs a faint smile on my lips, but it's short-lived as I slice the creature open.\n\nThe memory of crisp sunlight pouring onto Elara's bright face, as her gentle hands taught me to prepare dinner one summer afternoon, washes over me. The comfort of her kind words, the melody of her laughter rings in my ear as I start cooking over the small fire pit outside. The aroma of the roasting meat brings a pang of hunger amidst the cloud of my anguish.\n\nWith lunch prepared, I serve Snib on one of the newly dusted off wooden plates. The crude satisfaction he expresses at his meal inadvertently stirs a sense of achievement within me. For a brief moment, I'm back in my sun-kissed courtyard, serving my wife Elara a lovingly prepared meal.\n\nThe fantasy quickly breaks as Snib belches out his compliments, a cruel laughter punctuating his enjoyment. The offensive smell of fermented beef and vile goblin spit permeates the air, crumpling any fleeting semblance of home I had constructed within my worn-out soul.\n\nForced to succumb to the reality, I spend the rest of the sweltering afternoon cleaning up. The gruesome smell of Snib’s belched out compliments still hangs heavily in the air. Yet, a more pressing concern takes priority over my discomfort. My bladder, bearing the torment for hours, looks for sweet relief. A quick glance at my leash tied to a rusted iron ring and Snib snoozing comfortably convinces me that any peaceful trip to the latrine is far from possible.\n\n[Choice: You need to pee...",

My desperation intertwines with the humiliation he'd forced down my throat.\n\n\"No need, pet.\" His laughter echoes in the dismal hut. He points a gnarled finger towards a corner where a bucket of forgotten filth rests. \"There's yer jakes.\"\n\nMy face flushes, burning with the shame he’s just dropped on me. So this is the next level of my humiliation as his pet. I feel the protest bubble up, almost slip past my lips but catch it in time. Pointless. I've learned the game well enough; it’s best to shut up and get with it, endure and survive.\n\nAs I walk towards the rancid, rusty bucket, one careful step at a time on my high metal heels, I feel Snib's piercing gaze etch into my jiggling ass and thick thighs. I bite down hard against the shame that rises with each tiny, humming vibration of his disgusting laughter that hangs in the air.\n\n\"Squat right over it, cow. Ye don't wanna be missin' the target,\" he hoots, tugging on the leash, the wicked runes of the collar biting into my tender skin.\n\nMy face is on fire, heart pounding as if trying to escape the humiliating situation I’m being coerced into. Squatting down is a delicate balancing act in these heels, and despite Snib’s ruthless tugs on the leash, I keep steady, staring at the filthy mouth of the bucket.\n\n“Ah, look at those fat, plump cheeks of yours,” he comments from where he’s leaning, lecherous gaze roaming freely over my bare, round ass as I struggle for balance. His words are like acid sizzling along my skin. “Your milky tits hangin' like ripe melons, wobblin' with every breath. Gettin' a good show here, slave.”\n\nSilently, I grit my teeth, swallow down the bile at the back of my throat. I curl one hand protectively around my right breast to steady myself, the fullness surprising me once again. The cold bucket rim against my bare, full ass sends a shiver up my spine.\n\n\"Get on with it, 'cow tits,' don't keep your Master waiting,\" he barks, tugging the leash to make me yelp.\n\nI inhale deeply, summon my composure, and attempt to surrender to the natural call. I reckon this shouldn't be that hard, just... well, different.\n\nBut it's just not coming. The lewd spectacle is too much - the unfamiliarity of my new female body, a man-turned-woman in a degraded bondage of a perverse master.\n\nMy cheeks burn brighter at Snib's echoing sniggers. Any sense of privacy shattered by his lewd remarks. “Make sure y'don't miss the bucket and piss all over the floor. Don't want my cow making a mess now, do I?\"\n\n[Choice: Focus!",

My hips buck up HARD, driving my fingers deep as they'll go.

So much juice floods out that it sounds like I'm pissing myself, splattering onto the straw.\n\n\"THREE! YE DID IT!\" Snib crows, his cock bobbing with his excitement. That hanging rope of precum finally breaks, splattering across my lips. I taste it before I can react—salt and rot and something thick as paste. \"That's a hundred gold off!\"\n\nBut he's not pulling away. If anything, he's settling in more comfortably.\n\n\"Course...\" His voice gets sly. \"That was easy. Bet ye couldn't do something harder. Something worth...

My tits LURCH with the motion, slapping together wetly.\n\n\"What—can't handle more of me magnificent cock?\" Snib cackles, still gripping that purple monster. Another rope of precum oozes out, pools on the floor where I was just lying.\n\n\"I'm not—I just—\" My brain feels wrapped in wet wool.

While I lie here with his precum cooling on my cheek, his ball-stench in my nose, the memory of his cock-weight burning in my palms.\n\nThe darkness presses in. My heartbeat won't slow. Every time I close my eyes, I see that cock-slit gaping at me, drooling its corruption, and my mouth floods with spit I have to swallow.\n\n*I am Aldric. I am—*\n\nBut the words taste like lies. Aldric never sniffed cock. Aldric never felt his pussy clench at the smell of goblin balls. Aldric is becoming something else.

This close, I can see EVERYTHING.\n\nThe glans is mottled, darker at the corona where it flares out from the shaft, the ridge thick as rope. The surface has this... sponginess. Not smooth but textured with tiny bumps that pulse with blood flow. And the slit—\n\nVertical. Darker pink inside. The edges GLISTEN with precum that's collected in the corners like drool. And it's... moving. Flexing. Opening wider, then closing, then wider again, each time showing more of that wet pink tunnel that goes DOWN into—\n\n\"ONE!\" Snib shouts. My eyes water but I don't blink. Can't lose. \"Look how it's TALKIN' to ye!\"\n\nThe urethral opening DILATES, showing the inside walls, slick and—there's movement in there. Actual MOVEMENT. Like something's traveling up the pipe.\n\n\"TWO! It wants ta give ye a kiss! See?\"\n\nHe flexes. The whole head SWELLS, going from plum to apple-sized, and the slit opens so wide I can see—Eon's bones, I can see DOWN into him. Into the cum-pipe. There's something white moving up there, thick as porridge, CRAWLING upward—\n\n\"THREE!\"\n\nA bubble forms. Not of air. Of PRECUM. It swells at the opening like a frog's throat, glossy and white-yellow. Growing. The surface tension stretches, catching firelight, and I can see my own reflection in it—my face, wide-eyed, mouth open, staring at—\n\n\"FOUR! It's blowin' ye a kiss!\"\n\nThe bubble POPS. Not dramatically—just quietly releases and becomes a thick coating that glazes the entire head. But more's already forming. The slit gapes again and this time a proper ROPE oozes out, thick as my smallest finger, dangling and swaying—\n\n\"FIVE! Hah, look at it DROOL fer ye!\"\n\nThe strand stretches down, getting longer, swaying with his breathing. It's going to touch my face. Physics says it has to. Gravity plus length equals—\n\nI realize my fingers are still in my cunt. Still moving. The rhythm matches my heartbeat which matches the THROB of his cock which matches—\n\n\"SIX! See them veins?\"\n\nI see them. Green-tinged under goblin skin, thick as quill stems, creating a roadmap of blood flow. One particularly fat vein runs along the underside, pulsing so hard I can SEE his pulse. Watch the blood pump through. Watch how it makes the head SWELL with each beat.\n\n\"SEVEN! Almost there, hero!\"\n\nThe precum rope SWINGS. Almost touches my cheek. I tilt my head—just slightly—but keep my eyes locked on that dilating slit. It's getting WORSE. Or better. Or—my brain can't decide. The opening's staying wider now, like it's too aroused to close properly. I can see the walls inside GLISTENING, see how they're ribbed, see how deep it goes before darkness swallows the view—\n\n\"EIGHT! It REALLY likes ye!\"\n\nSomething else is coming. I can SEE it traveling up. A thicker glob, pushing the walls wider as it rises. The whole cockhead FLEXES to accommodate it. The slit spreads obscenely wide and—\n\n\"NINE!\"\n\n—a GUSH. Not a rope, not a bubble, an actual SPURT of precum that arcs through the air. I feel the wind of it passing my cheek, hear it SPLAT into the straw behind my head. The smell intensifies—concentrated rot that makes my pussy SQUEEZE so hard my fingers go numb.\n\n\"TEN! YE DID IT!\"\n\nI blink finally and tears stream down. My eyes BURN. But worse—my pussy just FLOODED. Like watching his cock's mouth gape and drool and SPIT at me translated directly to arousal. My fingers are soaked past the knuckle.\n\n\"Two hundred gold off!\" Snib announces. The head of his cock bobs with his breathing, that slit still winking at me, still drooling. \"That's three hundred total! At this rate ye'll be free in no time!\"\n\n*Three hundred. That's real. That's progress. I'm not just lying here fingering myself for nothing. This is TACTICAL. I'm taking advantage of this pathetic little creature and his out-of-control lust.*\n\n\"Course...\" His voice goes sly. \"That was just lookin'. Bet ye couldn't actually DO somethin'. Like... count how many finger-widths long me cock is. Worth... three hundred more!\"\n\nSix hundred gold total, that's more than half a thousand, that's REAL progress toward—\n\n\"But ye gotta use YER fingers to measure.\" He waggles his eyebrows. \"Actually touch it proper. Count from base to tip. What's wrong? Scared of a little cock-countin'?\"",

I scramble backward, tits LURCHING with the motion, ass dragging through the straw until my back hits the wall.\n\n\"No more—I can't—THREE HUNDRED GOLD! You said three hundred!\"\n\nMy voice cracks high, feminine, WEAK. The goblin pheromones swim through my sinuses like eels made of musk. Everything spins slightly. My pussy—that traitorous gash—is still clenching on nothing, making wet sounds I pretend not to hear.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Look at ye! Scurryin' away like a virgin at her first cock-sight!\" Snib's still gripping his shaft, that purple abortion swaying as he laughs. \"Could see ye MEMORIZING every vein! Countin' the wrinkles! Bet ye'll dream about it!\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" I pull my knees to my chest, trying to cover myself, but my tits are too massive—they spill over and around my thighs like sacks of warm dough. \"Just—shut up and let me sleep!\"\n\n\"Sleep?\" He waggles his cock at me. One last rope of precum flings through the air, splatters near my foot. \"After sniffin' gobbo-dick like a bitch in heat? After STARING at me piss-slit like it held the secrets of the universe?\"\n\nI turn away, curling into the corner, pulling handfuls of straw over myself like the world's most pathetic blanket. It pokes at my soft flesh—everything pokes now, everything HURTS this stupid sensitive body—but at least it covers some of my shame.\n\n\"Three hundred gold off yer slave-debt,\" Snib confirms, tucking his still-hard cock back into his loincloth with obvious difficulty. \"Tomorrow maybe we'll play MORE games. See how much that hero-pride is worth!\"\n\nHe waddles to his pile of furs, chuckling. Within minutes, his snores rattle the hut.\n\nBut I can't sleep.\n\nThe smell won't leave. It's INSIDE me now. Coating my sinuses like oil. Every breath tastes faintly of ball-musk and corruption. My eyes water but it's not tears—it's my body trying to flush out pheromones that have already seeped into tissue.\n\n*Eon, keeper of oaths—forgive me. I just... I stared at goblin cock for gold. Counted heartbeats while watching it DROOL.*\n\nMy pussy throbs once, hard, like a fist clenching. I ignore it.\n\nI know what comes next. The stories from the borderlands. Women found after goblin raids, bellies swollen, BEGGING not to be rescued. Saying their masters need them. That they're happy now.\n\nOne day. That's all it took. One day of washing his cum-rags and now I'm lying here with my cunt—CUNT, not pussy, this hungry thing has graduated to CUNT—still drooling from just LOOKING at dick.\n\nTomorrow will likely be worse.\n\nThe certainty hits like cold water. Tomorrow he'll push further. Tomorrow these \"games\" will involve more than looking. And my body—this cursed, sensitive, RESPONSIVE body—will betray me again. Will get wetter. Will throb harder. Will maybe even—\n\n*No.*\n\nBut the pheromones whisper otherwise. They're in my blood now, talking to parts of me that don't have words. The soft animal parts that just want to be filled, bred, claimed.\n\nI curl tighter, squeezing my eyes shut. But behind my eyelids, I see it perfectly: that purple head, the gaping slit, the way it flexed and drooled and SPOKE to something primitive in my transformed flesh.\n\nThree hundred gold earned. Just need ten thousand in total, and maybe the collar's magic will truly compel Snib to free me.\n\nIf I last that long.\n\n*Elara, forgive me. I'm trying. But this body... this fucking body wants things that would make you weep.*\n\nSleep, when it finally comes, is full of purple shadows and the taste of shame.\n\n[Choice: Next morning...]*Six hundred gold now. This pathetic creature doesn't realize I'm using HIM. Getting gold for simple tasks. I'm the one in control here, I'm—*\n\nSuddenly, my pussy SQUEEZES my fingers so hard they go numb for a second, like it's agreeing with the plan. Like it has its own opinion now.\n\nMy right hand goes to his cock. I reach out—hesitate—my fingertips hovering an inch from the shaft. This close I can feel the HEAT radiating off it. Like standing too near a forge.\n\n\"Well?\" Snib's voice is smug. \"Cock ain't gonna measure itself.\"\n\nI press my pinky to the base.\n\nThe texture—\n\n*Oh fuck.*\n\n[Image: Not like human skin. It's... MEAT.\nIt's not skin. Not like human skin. It's... MEAT. Dense meat wrapped in something slick. My finger presses into the thatch of his pubic hair—wiry, greasy strands that SCRATCH—and I feel the root of him there, buried in his crotch-flesh. Pulsing. The shaft itself is FIRM but has give, like pressing on a muscle that's flexed to stone.\n\n\"Count,\" Snib orders. \"Out loud. So's I know ye ain't cheatin'.\"\n\nMy mouth is so dry. \"One.\"\n\nI slide my pinky up one finger-width. The shaft is—it's not smooth. There are ridges, veins thick as roots, and they THROB under my touch. I feel his pulse through my fingertip. His heartbeat translating directly into—\n\n\"Two.\" My voice cracks. I press my ring finger up next to my pinky. Now I'm gripping with two fingers. Can barely get them around the circumference. The GIRTH—it's thick as my wrist. Thicker.\n\n\"Three.\" Middle finger joins. Three fingers pressed up against goblin cock. The heat is soaking into my palm. I can feel it traveling up my arm, spreading through my chest, pooling in my—\n\n\"Nnngh—\"\n\nDid I just MOAN?\n\nMy other hand—the left one—when did it go back between my legs? My fingers are MOVING again, sliding through the mess down there, finding that spot that makes my knees weak.\n\n\"Four.\" Index finger. Four fingers gripping his shaft now and I haven't even passed his midpoint. \"Five.\" My thumb joins, wrapping around, and NOW I can feel the full scope of it. The weight. The DENSITY. This isn't just flesh—this is a WEAPON. This is what split a hundred human women. This is what BREEDS.\n\n\"Unnngh—\" Snib grunts as my hand slides up another width. His cock FLEXES in my grip, the shaft going somehow THICKER for a moment, and I feel liquid warmth coat my palm. More precum. It's everywhere. Making my hand SLIP as I try to keep measuring.\n\n\"Six.\" My pinky again, higher up the shaft now. The veins are thicker here, more pronounced. I feel one particular vein—fat as a quill stem—pulsing against my finger pad.\n\n\"Seven.\" Ring finger. My grip is getting sloppy. Too much precum. I try to hold tighter but that just makes MORE ooze out, running down to my wrist.\n\n\"Eight.\" Middle finger. I'm breathing so hard. When did I start panting? My tits are heaving with each breath, SMACKING together when they peak and fall. Between my legs, my fingers are—they're not just RUBBING now, they're DIGGING, pushing deep into folds that have OPENED, that are GAPING for—\n\n\"Nine.\" Index finger. My small feminine fingers look RIDICULOUS against his cock. Like trying to measure a tree trunk with grass blades. The shaft just keeps GOING.\n\n[Image: Snib grunts as my hand slides up another width.\n\"Ten.\" Thumb. Halfway? More? I can't think. Can't—my pussy is making sounds now. Wet GURGLES every time my fingers push in, like it's DRINKING them.\n\n\"Eleven.\" Pinky higher. The shaft curves slightly here, arcing toward my face, and when I slide my hand up I feel the thick vein drag across my palm. It PULSES and I pulse back, my cunt SQUEEZING my fingers so hard they go numb.\n\n\"TWELVE.\"\n\nThe shaft is changing texture. Getting spongier toward the head. The skin here is different—thinner. When my finger makes contact, his whole cock JUMPS. And that makes the precum string swing, wrapping around my wrist like a bracelet.\n\n\"THIRTEEN.\"\n\nMy cunt is FLOODING. I can hear it—the wet sounds as my fingers get pulled in and pushed out by muscles I can't control. My own hips are moving, tiny circles, grinding my clit against my palm. When did that start? Why can't I—\n\n\"FOURTEEN. FIFTEEN.\"\n\nAlmost at the head now. The corona, that ridge where shaft becomes glans. It's raised like a mountain range, purple-dark, thick enough that I have to press harder to—\n\n\"SIXTEEN.\"\n\nThe head itself. Spongy. So different from the shaft. Like pressing on a mushroom that's been soaked in oil. It GIVES under my finger, but there's hardness underneath. Blood-filled chambers that—\n\n\"SEVENTEEN! S-seventeen fingers, Master Snib.\"\n\nThe words hang in the air. Seventeen of my delicate fingers to measure his goblin rape-stick. The precum is now wrapped around my wrist twice, cooling against my skin, and my fingers are COATED in the grease-slick of his cock skin.\n\n\"SEVENTEEN!\" He crows. \"That's a lot of hero-fingers! HARHARHAR! And ye called me Master without bein' told! Good girl!\"\n\n*I did. Why did I—*\n\n\"Three hundred more gold off! That's six hundred total! Good COW!\"\n\nMy cunt CELEBRATES. SPASMING around my fingers, releasing a flood of juice that drizzles the straw. Like my pussy is doing its own accounting, getting excited about the math.\n\n\"Now...\" Snib shifts closer. His cock bobs and the precum FINALLY breaks, leaving a glossy rope on my forearm that immediately starts cooling. \"Bet ye couldn't guess which of me balls is heavier. Worth... four hundred gold.\"\n\nMy pussy THROBS at the thought of more gold. The most so far Of getting closer to freedom. It's practically CHEWING on my fingers now, the muscles inside undulating like a throat trying to swallow.\n\n\"But ye gotta WEIGH 'em proper. One at a time. And don't make a SOUND until you got the answer.\"",

I'm so thrakking sorry.*\n\nTomorrow will be worse. I know it. Feel it. The pheromones are just starting. This is just day ONE. How many days before I'm not just measuring but—\n\n*Stop.*\n\nI curl tighter, the collar cold against my throat, and try to sleep. But all I can see behind my eyelids is that purple head.

Each testicle is apple-sized, kidney-shaped, and they're MOVING INSIDE the sack. Churning. I can SEE them shifting, rotating, like they're MANUFACTURING something in there.\n\nI thought he meant to weigh with with my HAND!\n\n\"Open wide!\"\n\n\"Wai-MMMPH!\"\n\nBefore I can protest further, his left nut DROPS onto my mouth.\n\nThe weight—it's like someone placed a hot stone on my lips. The skin tastes of concentrated sweat-brine, like licking the inside of old boots mixed with rotted cheese. But it's the TEXTURE that makes my brain scream—wrinkled and rough with wiry hairs that poke my cheeks, and underneath, through the sack-skin, I feel the actual ORGAN. Dense. Meaty. And it's... TWITCHING.\n\n*Pulse. Pulse. Pulse.*\n\nEach heartbeat makes it throb against my lips. Makes the whole thing SWELL slightly then relax. Like it's breathing.\n\nMy nose is pressed into his taint. That dark bridge of skin between balls and asshole, slick with sweat that immediately floods my nostrils. The smell—It's not just musk, it's **PRIMAL ALCHEMY**. A concentrated, conqueror's incense that bypasses the soul and gives orders directly to the **animal meat at the base of my skull**. Makes my eyes water. Makes my pussy—\n\n*DON'T MAKE A SOUND.*\n\nHis other ball swings and SLAPS my cheek. The impact makes a wet sound—*PLAP*—and leaves a grease-mark on my skin. Now both nuts are covering my face, the sack spreading out like a flesh-blanket. I can't see. Can barely breathe. Just darkness and WEIGHT and that churning sensation as his balls literally WORK against my face.\n\nInside my mouth, that left testicle is—it's RESPONDING to the heat. To the moisture. The sack-skin is loosening, letting the actual ball slide lower, pressing harder against my lips. I feel every detail—the tubes connected to it, the way it's suspended in the sack, the little LUMPS on the surface where sperm is being—\n\n*GLRRRRRK*\n\n[Image: A sound escapes. A GURGLE.\n\nA sound escapes. A GURGLE. Because his ball just flexed like a muscle, pushing deeper into my mouth, and my pussy CELEBRATED by squirting a stream of juice that I hear hit the straw three feet away.\n\n\"What's that?\" His voice is muffled by his own sack. \"Did ye make a sound?\"\n\nI try to shake my head but that just makes his balls ROLL across my face, the right one sliding into my mouth as the left pops out. This one's DIFFERENT. Heavier. DENSER. And it's moving more, churning harder, like there's something angry trapped inside trying to get out. The surface RIPPLES against my tongue and—\n\nHis cock. I can't see it but I FEEL it. Draped across my chest, the head resting on my belly. Heavy as a club. And it's DROOLING—I feel hot wetness pooling in my navel, overflowing, running down my sides. Each of his heartbeats makes more precum GUSH out, marking me, claiming territory from my tits to my—\n\n*CHURRRRRN*\n\nBoth balls SHIFT. The sack contracts, pulling them tight against my face, and something inside them MOVES. Not just twitching—MOVING. Like giant tadpoles swimming in there. Like his unborn children are already ALIVE, already seeking. The vibration travels through my lips, through my teeth, into my skull and—\n\n\"MMMMMNNNNNGHHHHHHH!\"\n\nI scream into his sack.\n\nNot a little sound. A full-throated WAIL that vibrates his balls, and my pussy EXPLODES.\n\nThe orgasm hits like getting struck by lightning in the cunt. Every muscle from navel to knees SEIZES. My pussy doesn't just squeeze—it MILKS my fingers, the walls undulating in waves, trying to pull something deeper that isn't there. Juice doesn't just leak—it SPRAYS. I hear it splashing, feel it running down my thighs, pooling under my ass.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Listen to that hero-cunt coo!\"\n\nHe lifts slightly and I GASP, my mouth releasing his ball with a wet POP. Strings of spit mixed with ball-sweat connect my lips to his sack. My face is GLAZED with his essence, shining in the firelight. My pussy is still spasming, still squirting little jets with each aftershock.\n\n\"L-left,\" I babble like a broken thing. \"Left ball heavier.\"\n\n\"Ye FAILED!\" Snib swings off my face, his cock leaving a snail-trail of precum across my tits as he moves. \"Made noise! Big, slutty, CUM noise! No gold!\"\n\n\"But—but I—\" My voice is broken. Husky. Destroyed by screaming into testicles. \"I said which was—\"\n\n\"Rules were NO SOUND!\" He's grinning down at me. His cock hasn't softened at all—if anything it's HARDER, the head gone from purple to almost black, the slit gaping open and FLOODING precum. \"So ye LOST that four hundred. Actually...\"\n\nHis yellow eyes gleam.\n\n\"Ye're DOWN three hundred now. From before.\"\n\nMy brain tries to calculate through the fog of ball-stench that's COATED my sinuses. Six hundred earned minus three hundred lost—\n\n\"Tell ye what, cow-tits.\" He squats next to me, cock swinging like a pendulum. \"One last chance. WINNER TAKE ALL.\"\n\nMy pussy—that traitorous meat between my legs—actually THROBS with interest.\n\n\"Hold me cock for ten seconds. No sounds. That's it.\" His grin widens. \"Ye win? Eight hundred gold off yer debt. Ye lose...\"\n\nHe pauses for effect.\n\n\"Ye lose EVERYTHING ye earned tonight. Back to where ye started. Plus yer naked again tomorrow for chores.\"\n\nThe math. Eight hundred gold. That's real progress. That's ACTUAL freedom getting closer. All I have to do is hold it. I've already touched it. Already measured it. Ten seconds is nothing. Ten seconds is—\n\n\"What'll it be?\"\n\n[Choice: Take the bet.]",

The head PLUNGES through my finger-tunnel, emerging on the other side to SPIT another rope across my chest. I watch it in slow motion—the slit opening, the white-yellow GUNK shooting out, splattering across my tits, my throat, pooling in my collarbones.\n\n\"Five.\"\n\nHis balls SWING forward and SLAP my wrists.\n\nThe impact shouldn't matter but it DOES.

And the emptiness, the NEED—\n\n\"Nnnnh—\"\n\nIt's barely anything. Just a whisper. A breath with voice. But—\n\n\"EIGHT! YE MADE A SOUND!\"\n\nHe doesn't stop fucking my hands. If anything he goes HARDER, really PUMMELING through my grip, his cock so slathered in precum now it's like holding a greased eel. Each thrust makes wet SHLOCK-SHLOCK sounds.\n\n\"NO!\" The word tears out of me. \"That wasn't—I didn't—\"\n\n\"Lost ALL yer gold!

Won't let go. Eight hundred gold just GONE because I made one tiny sound, because my pussy DEMANDED cock so hard it made my vocal cords disobey me.\n\n\"Please!\" I'm begging now. \"One more chance! I was so close!\"\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Listen to the hero BEG!\"\n\nHe pulls his cock from my hands—they stay frozen in tube-shape, like they've forgotten how to be hands—and it SLAPS against my face.

      "text": "My mouth opens.\n\nJust opens. Like my jaw has its own plans now.\n\n\"That's it, spread them cock-pillows wide!\"\n\nThe head approaches. Flared wide as a doorknob. The slit GAPING.\n\nContact.\n\nThe head presses against my lips and they have to stretch like I'm trying to swallow an apple whole. My jaw audibly POPS as it unhinges to accommodate the width. The taste hits immediately—concentrated dick-rot mixed with salt and something chemical, like an alchemist's acid that's been fermenting in ball-sweat.\n\nIt's IN.\n\nThe whole plum-sized head fills my mouth. My lips are stretched into this obscene O, the corners already burning from the strain. My tongue is TRAPPED underneath, pressed flat by the weight of goblin cock-meat. And the HEAT—it's like holding a burning coal that won't stop PULSING.\n\n\"ONE!\"\n\nSnib looks down at me. My green eyes staring up at him. I don't dare think about what that looks like.\n\n\"The mighty Aldric! With gobbo-meat stretching them pretty lips!\"\n\nI can't respond. Can't nod. Can't shake my head. Just HOLD. The head THROBS against my soft palate and I feel the first micro-spurt of... something. Not a stream—a SLUG of hot slime that hits the back of my throat. I can't swallow. Won't swallow. It pools under my tongue.\n\n\"TWO!\"\n\nAnother throb. Another micro-shot. The precum is THICK, coating my mouth, making everything slippery. My tongue accidentally brushes the underside of his cock and I feel that fat vein PULSE in response.\n\n\"Wonder if she'll taste gobbo-cock on yer mouth when ye get back?\" Snib grins wider.\n\nMy hands CLENCH into fists. Don't touch yourself. DON'T fucking touch that sopping mess between your legs that's BEGGING for...\n\n\"THREE!\"\n\nThe head inflates in my mouth, going from plum to small apple. My jaw CREAKS. More precum—this time a steady drizzle that's filling the pocket under my tongue. The taste is getting STRONGER. Getting into my sinuses from inside.\n\n\"Ye're CHEATIN' on that pretty wife!\" Snib's voice goes mock-serious. \"Right now! Got another male's cock in yer mouth! FOUR!\"\n\nAlmost half over. I try to breathe through my nose but that just means inhaling PURE ball-stench from where his sack hangs inches below my chin. My pussy CLENCHES so hard I feel juice run down my thigh.\n\n\"Hehehehe, FIVE! When ye get back to bein' Aldric, ye'll have to live knowin' ye sucked gobbo-cock!\"\n\nThe precum is building. Building. I can't swallow. My mouth is FLOODING with it. It's leaking out the corners of my lips, running down my chin in thick streams. The head FLEXES and another SPURT hits—harder this time, with actual force.\n\n*Don't listen. Count. Just count.*\n\n\"SIX!\"\n\nMy tongue MOVES without permission. Just a twitch, but it brushes his frenulum and his whole cock JUMPS. My mouth briefly opens wider—I almost GAG—and more precum FLOODS in. It's flowing steadily now, his piss-slit staying open, just DROOLING directly onto my tongue.\n\n\"Know what I'm gonna call that mouth from now on?\" His hand goes to my hair, not pulling, just HOLDING. Possessive. \"Yer face-cunt! Cause that's what it is! Just another hole for gobbos to fuck! SEVEN!\"\n\nMy whole body is SHAKING. The effort of not moving, not moaning, not SWALLOWING is making me sweat. Beads run between my tits, pool in my navel, mix with the precum from earlier that's still coating my chest.\n\n\"Look at them lips! EIGHT! Natural cock-holsters! Ye were MADE for this!\"\n\nI'm drowning in precum. It's EVERYWHERE—coating my teeth, my gums, pooling in my cheeks. Some of it's leaked down my throat despite trying not to swallow. Just enough to make my stomach feel warm.\n\n\"Ye know what? When I pump me load down this throat, ye'll THANK me for it! Cause that's what face-cunts do!\"\n\nThe words hit right as my pussy SPASMS. Not an orgasm but close. So close. And the movement, the shudder that goes through me, the way my throat constricts trying not to cry out—\n\n\"Mmmmnph—\"\n\nIt's tiny. Just the smallest whimper. Vibrating around his cock. But—\n\n\"HEARD THAT!\"\n\nHis grin is PURE EVIL.\n\n\"Ye made a sound! That means—\"\n\nBoth hands go to my head.\n\n\"That means I get to fuck this hero's face-cunt properly!\"\n\n[Choice: Oh no...",

The head of his cock FLEXES in my mouth, swelling fatter. \"That means I get to use this face-cunt proper.\"\n\nI try to pull back, but his grip is too tight. My lips slide maybe an inch up his shaft before I'm stopped. The movement makes my tits SWING and I feel their weight pulling at my shoulders.\n\n\"Gonna go nice and slow,\" Snib says, adjusting his grip. His fingers thread through my black hair—so much fucking hair now—and twist. \"Want ye to feel everything.\"\n\nHe pushes.\n\nJust a little.\n\n*GLUK*\n\nThe head presses against the back of my throat and my body KNOWS what to do. Something written in my meat that makes my throat muscles RELAX, makes the passage open like it's been waiting for this. An inch slides past my tonsils.\n\n[Image: 'GLLLLRRK!'\n\"GLLLLRRK!\"\n\n\"There it is!\" Snib's voice is gleeful. \"That throat knows what it's for!\"\n\nAnother inch. Two. The shaft is so THICK my jaw creaks. Spit runs from the corners of my stretched lips, down my chin, dripping onto my tits. I can feel every vein, every ridge, the way his cock PULSES with goblin blood as it invades deeper.\n\n\"Know what I'm thinkin' about?\" Snib asks, still pushing. Slow. Patient. Like he has all night. \"I'm thinkin' about all them gobbos ye killed. Grotch. Skrittle.\"\n\n*GLUK-GLUK-GLURRRRK*\n\nThree more inches disappear. My throat BULGES. I can see it when I look down—the shape of his cock making my neck swell like I've swallowed a fucking cudgel. My hands fly to my throat, feeling it from the outside, feeling HIM through my own flesh.\n\n*GLORK-GLORK-GLLLLLK*\n\n\"But here's the thing—\" His grip tightens. \"Here ye are. The great Aldric. With gobbo cock stuffed down yer pretty throat.\" He laughs, this wet rattling sound.\n\nMy throat is GRIPPING him, its muscles RIPPLING along his shaft, massaging it. It's like swallowing in reverse—my body trying to pull him DEEPER even as my mind screams.\n\n\"Humans always thought ye were better,\" Snib grunts, pushing again. Eight inches. Nine. \"Taller. Stronger. Smarter.\" His balls are getting closer to my chin. \"But look at ye now.\"\n\n*SPLORCH-GLUK-GLORRRRK*\n\nThe obscene sounds fill the hut. Wet. The sound of a throat being STUFFED. My hands are still at my neck, feeling how it stretches, how it accommodates this INVASION. How perfectly it molds to his shape.\n\n\"Ye know what the best part is?\" He's almost fully hilted now. Maybe two inches left. His balls REEK—concentrated musk that floods my nostrils with each desperate breath through my nose. \"Ye're never gonna turn back now.\"\n\nHe SLAMS the last two inches home.\n\n*GLOOOOORRRRK*\n\nMy nose MASHES into his crotch. His balls slap against my chin, heavy and churning with seed. The SMELL—gods, the SMELL—it's everywhere. In my nose, my throat, like it's soaking into my fucking bones.\n\n\"THERE we go!\" He holds me there, ground against him. \"Balls deep in a hero's throat! Can ye feel 'em churnin' against yer chin?\"\n\nHe pulls back. Not all the way—just enough that I can catch a desperate breath through my nose before he SLAMS back in.\n\n*GLORK-SPLURCH-GLORRRRK*\n\n\"This is what happens to humies!\" He's found a rhythm now. Long, deep strokes that use my throat like a fucking sleeve.\n\nEach thrust makes my tits BOUNCE. Makes them slap together with wet sounds. My tits flop while a goblin fucks my face.\n\n\"And the best part—\" THRUST \"—is ye're startin'—\" THRUST \"—to LIKE it!\"\n\nMy hands aren't at my throat anymore. They're at my pussy. When did that happen? When did my fingers find that wet hole and start WORKING it? Three fingers buried knuckle-deep, thumb on the swollen thing that sends lightning through my belly with each press.\n\n\"That's it! Finger that hero-cunt while I fuck yer throat!\" His pace increases. \"Bet Elara never made ye DROOL like this!\"\n\nSpit and throat-slime coat his shaft, drip onto my tits, pool between them. Each thrust makes more pour out around his cock. My face is GLAZED with it. My own throat-juice mixed with his precum, marking me.\n\n\"Gonna cum soon,\" he grunts. His cock's getting THICKER. I can feel it swelling in my throat, stretching me even more.",

I TAP frantically on his thigh—the universal signal.\n\n\"HARHARHAR!\"\n\nHe pulls back—not all the way, just enough that his cock-head rests on my tongue. My jaw ACHES trying to stay open wide enough.\n\n\"GONNA NUT!\"\n\nThe first rope shoots directly onto my tongue. THICK. Hot as fresh-boiled porridge. The texture—gods, the TEXTURE—semi-solid CHUNKS mixed with liquid. The taste floods everything—salt and copper and that sick sweetness like fruit gone bad.\n\n[Image: THICK. Hot as fresh-boiled porridge.\n\n\"SWALLOW IT!\"\n\nI do. The thick glob slides down my throat. Feel it traveling all the way down to my—\n\n\"HARHAR! DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO!\" He pulls completely out, cock SWINGING, and the second rope—\n\n—arcs through the air. I watch it. See every detail. The yellow-white string thick as my finger, rotating as it flies, catching firelight. It SLAPS across my forehead, hot enough to make me flinch.\n\n\"NNNNGH!\" Snib's grunting like an animal. \"TAKE IT! TAKE ME NUTSLOP!\"\n\nThree more ropes in quick succession. One across my right eye, sealing it shut. One diagonally from temple to chin. The third—the THICKEST—hits me square in the nose, the impact actually making a sound, the cum so heavy it immediately starts sliding down.\n\nHis hand's pumping his shaft now, MILKING more out.\n\nThis one's different. CHUNKIER. Like custard with lumps in it. Hits my lips, spreads across them, some getting in my mouth. Tastes STRONGER. Concentrated.\n\n\"Open up! Catch some more!\"\n\nMy mouth opens without thinking. Just OPENS.\n\nDirect hit. Fills my mouth halfway in one shot. The weight of it on my tongue. The TEMPERATURE. The way it immediately starts coating everything—teeth, gums, roof of my mouth.\n\n\"Hold it! DON'T SWALLOW YET!\"\n\nI hold it. This mouthful of goblin seed. Feel it moving—actually MOVING—on my tongue. Like the tadpoles are already swimming, already seeking.\n\nMore ropes hit my face while I hold that load. *SPLURT* across my cheek. *BLORP* on my chin. *SPLURRRT* in my hair. Each one hot, heavy, marking me.\n\n\"Look up at me!\"\n\nI look up. One eye sealed shut with cum. The other blurry with tears. My mouth open, showing him his yellow-white load pooling on my tongue.\n\n\"*Now* swallow.\"\n\n*GULP.*\n\nThe sound is obscene. The FEELING is worse. Like swallowing thick soup that's been left out too long. It coats my throat going down, leaves a film I can FEEL.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Good girl!\"\n\nThe final three ropes—weaker but still thick. One hits my sealed eye, adding another layer. One across my tits. The last dribbles onto my forehead.\n\nSnib's cock finally stops shooting, just drooling now. Long strings of post-cum hanging from the tip, swaying.\n\nMy face is GLAZED. I can feel the weight of it. The heat. Starting to cool now, getting thicker, forming a mask. Some of it's in my nose—I smell nothing but goblin cum. Some in my ears—I HEAR it squelching when I move.\n\n\"There we go! Proper face-paintin'!\"\n\nHe grabs my hair, uses it to turn my head side to side, admiring his work.\n\n\"Gonna let it dry on ye. Like war-paint. Gobbo-owned war paint!\"\n\nA chunk slides off my nose, lands on my tit with a *plap*.\n\n\"Tomorrow—\" He's tucking his cock away, still chuckling. \"Tomorrow we work on the breeding-hole. But tonight? Tonight ye sleep with me load on yer face. So ye remember. Yer MINE now.\"\n\nHe walks away laughing. I stay kneeling. Cum cooling on my face, turning to crust. In my belly, the load I swallowed sits heavy and hot, already being absorbed.\n\nI am goblin-owned.\n\nAnd the worst part?\n\nMy pussy is still drooling.[[Image: 'Here it comes, hero-cunt!'\n\nThe veins bulge so much I feel them pressing against my esophagus from inside, each pulse making my neck expand to accommodate this breeding-club that's using my throat as a sheath.\n\n\"Here it comes, hero-cunt!\" Snib's voice seems distant, muffled by his own balls mashed against my chin. They're CHURNING against my face—I can feel the actual MOVEMENT inside the sack, like snakes writhing in a bag. \"Gonna paint yer guts!\"\n\nThe first pulse travels through his cock like a fist through a sleeve. I FEEL it moving up the shaft—the base swells, then mid-shaft, then—\n\nHeat.\n\nNot in my throat. In my STOMACH.\n\nThe cum bypasses everything, shooting directly into my gut.\"\n\nIt's like someone poured hot porridge straight into my belly. No taste, no swallow—just sudden WEIGHT and warmth spreading through my core. His cock is so deep it's basically a feeding tube, and he's pumping his SEED directly into—\n\nMore. So much more. Each pulse of his cock—and I feel EVERY ONE through my stretched throat—delivers another rope. I can't see it but I KNOW what it looks like: yellow-white, thick as custard, chunks of concentrated goblin genetics slathering on top of freshly-eaten rabbit meat.\n\n[Image: 'TAKE IT ALL!'\n\n\"TAKE IT ALL!\" His hips grind harder, trying to get even DEEPER.\n\nHis balls contract against my chin—I feel them TIGHTEN, the wrinkled sack pulling taut, then releasing as they pump. They're working like bellows.\n\nMy stomach feels... full. Fuller. FULLEST.\n\nNot just with cum but with HEAT. It's spreading through my gut like I've swallowed coals. I feel the PRESSURE from inside.\n\nMy body responds without permission.\n\nMy pussy CLENCHES. Then releases. Then clenches HARDER. The muscles inside go crazy, rippling from entrance to cervix in waves. Something hot runs down my thigh—not piss, something thicker, something that smells like MY shame mixed with HIS triumph.\n\nMy hips buck. My back arches. My hands fly to my pussy and I'm—*Fucking CUMMING.*\n\nThe orgasm hits slow and deep, starting in my gut where his seed is pooling and spreading outward. Not a sharp pleasure like before, but something DEEPER.\n\n[Image: 'HARHARHAR! Cummin' from gettin' her stomach bred!'\n\"HARHARHAR! Cummin' from gettin' her stomach bred!\"\n\nI'm making sounds around his cock—muffled, desperate sounds. Not moans. GRUNTS. Like an animal. Like something being mated. Each pulse of my pussy makes more juice spurt out, spattering the floor beneath me.\n\nHis cock FLEXES one more time—bigger than before—and I feel the BIGGEST rope yet travel up his shaft. The base bulges. Then the bulge travels up, up, UP—\n\nThis one I almost TASTE. It's so forceful it splashes back up my esophagus a bit, coating my throat from inside. Concentrated goblin spunk—salty and sour and WRONG, with an aftertaste like spoiled milk mixed with coin metal.\n\n\"NNNGH!\"\n\nHis balls are still working but slower now. Each pulse is smaller, each rope less forceful. But he stays hilted, making sure every DROP goes directly into my stomach. Making sure it STAYS there. Making sure I'll be digesting his cum for hours, absorbing his orgasm through my gut.\n\nFinally—FINALLY—he starts to pull out.\n\nThe withdrawal is worse than the insertion. Inch by inch of spit-slick cock emerges from my throat, dragging out throat-slime with it. When the head finally passes my tonsils I taste it FULLY for the first time—\n\n*SOUR.* Like milk left in the sun mixed with raw eggs.\n\nThe head POPS free from my lips with a wet sound. A string of cum mixed with throat-slime connects us for a moment before breaking, splattering across my tits.\n\nI gasp. Cough. Retch. My first breath tastes like goblin cock. My second breath tastes like goblin cum. Everything tastes like—\n\n\"Look at that throat!\" Snib grabs my face, forces me to look up. \"Can see the shape of me cock in it still!\"\n\nHe's right.\n\nHe releases me and I collapse forward, hands on the ground, these massive tits swaying. My belly feels HOT. Full. Like I've eaten a feast but it's all HIM. All his seed. Some of it probably already being absorbed through my stomach lining into my blood.\n\n\"Yer a gobbo-owned bitch now,\" Snib announces, matter-of-fact. \"Got me seed in yer belly. Gonna be tastin' it for days. Burpin' it up. Rememberin' who fed ye.\"\n\nEverything stays down. The collar won't let me purge his gift. I'm going to have to DIGEST this. Have to let it become part of me.\n\n\"That was just practice.\" Snib waddles around to face me, his cock still drooling post-cum. \"Tomorrow, we work on the OTHER hole.\"\n\nHe laughs as he walks away, leaving me on my knees, belly full of goblin cum, pussy still spasming from the most humiliating orgasm of my life.\n\n[Choice: That night...",

What's not normal is how HIGH the doorframes seem, how the velvet curtains drag past my eye-level, how the crystal chandeliers dangle like moons I could never reach.\n\nMy body jiggles as I walk. That's... that's normal too, right? These tits bounce—but something's different. They're LOWER on my frame, almost like they're at my waist. My hips roll in this exaggerated sway that makes my ass—FUCK there's so much of it—clap with each barefoot step.\n\n*Why am I barefoot?*\n\nThe marble feels cold under my soles. I look down and see green. Green feet. With slightly elongated toes that grip the floor as I walk.\n\nA merchant in fine silks rounds the corner, his eyes scanning the hall. His gaze drops and finds me, and something predatory flashes in his expression.\n\n\"How much for the night?\" His voice booms from above.\n\nMy mouth opens. I want to say 'fuck off' but what comes out is—\n\n\"Mmm, for a big-dicked humie like you?\" My voice is HIGH. Too high. Musical and desperate. \"Only fifty silver for Eleek's throat-pussy!

Just my bare pussy, darker green than the rest of me, already glistening.\n\n\"Cheap, even for a gobbo whore,\" the merchant laughs. \"Turn around, show me that fat little ass.\"\n\nI don't want to but I DO. I turn, bend forward, hands on my knees. Feel my ass cheeks spread. Feel the cool air hit my holes. My voice comes out in this DISGUSTING coo:\n\n\"Eleek's got the best fuck-cushions in the whole Rose! That's cuz us gobbo-girls know how to milk humie cock proper-like! All that BOOYAGH seed, right in me breeding-hole!\"\n\nNo. No no no. I'm not a goblin. I'm ELISE. Wait, no, I'm—\n\nThe merchant's hand CRACKS across my ass. \"Yeah, you greensluts are all the same. Heard you can even cum just from the smell of human cock.\"\n\n\"Only if it's real STINKY!\" I giggle. GIGGLE. My body straightens and I look up—UP—at him.\n\nHe grabs my arm. His hand completely encircles it. Lifts me like I weigh nothing, and suddenly I'm flying through the air into a room—\n\n*WHUMP*\n\nI land on silk sheets that smell like a hundred different men. The bed is ENORMOUS. Or no—I'm just... small. So small. The merchant is already dropping his pants and his cock—\n\n\"THAT'S what Eleek needs!\" My hands fly to my pussy, spreading it wide. \"Big humie dick for little gobbo cunt! Gonna make Eleek SQUIRT!\"\n\n*I'M NOT A GOBLIN!*\n\nBut when I look at my hands they're green. When I feel my ears they're huge and pointed. My hair is the same black silk but when I see my reflection in the mirror across the room—\n\nUpturned nose. Sharp little teeth when I smile—and I AM smiling, this lewd fucking grin. My nipples are so dark they're almost black, huge areolas on tits that look even bigger on my tiny frame. Between my legs, my pussy is this obscene darker green, like overripe fruit.\n\n\"Please!\" I try to say stop but what comes out is: \"Please wreck Eleek's gobbo holes! Yesterday some hero-cunt sucked gobbo cock for gold and now she's basically gobbo herself!\"\n\nThe merchant laughs. \"Yeah, I heard about that. Aldric the 'Great.'\" He lines up his cock with my pussy. \"Anyone who does that ain't human anymore. Just another worthless greenskin whore.\"\n\n*THAT'S NOT TRUE!*\n\nBut my legs spread wider. Wrap around him. Pull him in as he SLAMS forward and—\n\nThe dream SHIFTS—\n\nNow I'm in the lobby. The grand fucking lobby of the Midnight Rose with its fountain bubbling rose-water and its velvet divans and there's CROWDS. Merchants, guards, nobles, even other whores—human whores, tall and elegant and looking down at me with disgust.\n\nI'm on my hands and knees. Cum drips from my pussy, my ass, pools under me. My face is GLAZED with it. The taste of a dozen different cocks coats my tongue. My belly's swollen with seed and when I burp, bubbles of cum pop from my lips.\n\n\"More!\" My treacherous mouth begs. \"Eleek needs MORE! Who wants to go next? Only twenty silver now! Discount for marathon breeding!\"\n\n[Image: 'I heard she used to be someone important!'\n\n\"Look at the gobbo slut!\"\n\n\"I heard she used to be someone important!\"\n\n\"I heard she sucked goblin cock for coin!\"\n\n\"Chose gold over dignity!\"\n\n\"Now she IS one!\"\n\nAnd then—in the crowd—red hair—\n\n*No.*\n\nElara.\n\nMy wife standing there in traveling clothes, looking down at me with... not hatred. Worse. PITY.\n\n\"I can't believe you used to be my husband,\" she says, her voice cutting through the crowd's laughter. \"Reduced to this for a few gold coins.\"\n\nI try to say her name but what comes out is: \"Wanna watch Eleek get bred?

But Eleek can't—FUCK—can't stop being a—AAAAH—a WHORE!\"\n\nI'm crying and cumming at the same time. Snot runs from my nose, mixing with cum. My hands won't stop working my pussy, making wet SCHLICK-SCHLICK sounds that echo in the lobby.\n\n\"Listen to her!\" Someone laughs. \"She's apologizing while finger-fucking herself!\"\n\n\"That's what goblin cum does to a human brain!\"\n\n\"She's more goblin than human now!\"\n\n\"ELEEK IS BROKEN!\" I sob-scream. \"ELEEK'S BRAIN IS FULL OF GOBBO-CUM! IT SLOSHES WHEN ELEEK THINKS! Yesterday Eleek thought she was a hero but then—THEN—\"\n\nMy fingers hit something deep and I SQUIRT. A fucking GEYSER of pussy juice that arcs through the air, splattering the crowd. They step back in disgust but I'm on my hands and knees, CRAWLING to the puddle of my own juice, LAPPING IT UP.\n\n\"That's my husband,\" Elara says to someone. \"Or was. Now look—she's drinking her own pussy juice because it tastes like the goblin cum she swallowed.\"\n\n\"ELEEK IS THIRSTY!\" I wail between licks. \"Eleek is ruined! Eleek's brain is porridge! Warm cum-porridge! Eleek—\"\n\n*GASP*\n\nI wake up.\n\nBut my hand is BURIED in my pussy. Three fingers deep, fucking myself with the same rhythm from the dream. My other hand squeezes my tit so hard it hurts. The hay under me is SOAKED. I've been squirting in my sleep.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Listen to her moanin'!\"\n\nSnib. Standing over me. His cock out, dripping precum onto my face.\n\n\"Been watchin' ye for an hour! Humpin' the air, beggin' for cock in yer sleep! Kept sayin' 'Eleek needs' this and 'Eleek wants' that!\"\n\n[Choice: Ugh.",

Still this meat-prison that bounces and sways and—\n\nMy belly.\n\nWhen I sit up, I feel WEIGHT in my stomach. Something warm that sloshes slightly when I move. My hand goes to my abdomen and I can feel the slight bulge of—\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Bet ye ain't hungry this mornin'!\" Snib's still standing there, cock out, that purple monster swaying as he shifts. \"Got a belly full of gobbo-breakfast from last night!\"\n\nI won't think about it. Won't think about the MASS of cum that's been sitting in my stomach all night, fermenting, digesting, becoming part of—\n\n\"Need to hunt.\" My words come out softer than intended. \"Food. For today.\"\n\n\"Nah ye don't!\" Snib grabs his cock, shakes it. A rope of precum flings off, lands on the dirt floor. \"Gobbo nut's got everything a growin' girl needs! Protein and... uh... vitamins? Whatever humies call it!\"\n\nI stand. My thighs slip against each other. They're WET. Have been wet all night. The dream—fuck, the DREAM— I was a...\n\nI grab my armor from the corner. The metal triangles are cold against my nipples, making them peak instantly. When I bend to pull up the thong, I feel that cum-weight shift in my belly. Feel it MOVE. Like it's alive in there.\n\n\"What...\" I clear my throat again. Try to sound more like Aldric. \"What are we doing today... Master Snib?\"\n\nThe word comes easier now. Master. After yesterday, after the gold-counting, after his cock in my—\n\n\"Changed me mind!\" He announces, scratching his balls. \"Need me slave in better shape first 'fore I take ye anywhere.\"\n\n\"Then what—\"\n\n\"Got a new deal fer ye!\" His yellow eyes gleam. \"Five days. That's all. Five mornings of sayin' hello to me cock—just a little sniff, maybe a kiss—and I'll let ye go!\"\n\nMy whole body goes rigid. \"You said ten thousand gold.\"\n\n\"That too! But this is EASIER! Just five days of mornin' greetings! If ye're really the hero ye say ye are, should be simple!\"\n\nHe waddles closer. That SMELL hits—concentrated ball-rot that makes my sinuses burn and my pussy—\n\n*No. Not my pussy. Just a physical response. Meaningless.*\n\n\"Come on then! Just say good mornin' to me cock! Give it a sniff! That's all!\"\n\nHis cock is RIGHT THERE. A foot from my face. The head is darker purple today, almost black at the edges. The slit gapes and closes like it's breathing. Precum doesn't drip—it OOZES in thick strands that pool on the floor.\n\n\"I won't break,\" I say, but my voice sounds... smaller.\n\n\"Course not! Yer Aldric the Great!\" He grabs his cock, angles it at my face. \"So prove it!\"",

When did my hand naturally rest right above my ass, fingers splayed like I'm FRAMING it?\n\n\"So?\" Snib grins. \"That was yesterday! Today's a new day! New chances fer gold!\"\n\n\"You said five days.\" The words come out... breathy. \"If that's really all—\"\n\n\"NOT HERE!\" He waves his hand dismissively. \"Outside! By the well! I'm thirsty anyway. Need me morning water. Fresh air. Sunshine on me cock. Come on!\"]The math happens before I can stop it. Five days. Five sniffs. Then freedom. My pussy—that ALIEN thing between my legs—actually CLENCHES at the thought. Like it's doing its own accounting.\n\n\"That's all!\" Snib confirms, grinning. \"Unless ye can't handle it. Unless yer already breakin' from one little throat-fuck—\"\n\n\"I'm not breaking.\" But my voice has this... lilt to it. This musical quality that makes every word sound like I'm ASKING something.\n\n\"Prove it then! But NOT HERE!\" He scratches his balls, making wet sounds. \"Outside! By the well! Need me morning water anyway!\"\"...Fine. One sniff.\"\n\nThe agreement slides out like silk. Too easy. When did agreeing become so—\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Knew it! But NOT HERE!\" Snib's already waddling toward the door. \"Outside! By the well! Want the mornin' sun on me cock while ye worship—I mean, while ye sniff it!\"\n\nI reach for the bucket—have to bend at the waist now because squatting makes my thighs spread too wide, makes the metal thong dig into places that—\n\nThe bucket's handle feels different in my grip. Not just the difference between my male hands and my woman's hands - I register the difference between TODAY and fucking YESTERDAY!\n\nMy whole body moves like water now, each motion flowing into the next. The walk to the door is—\n\n*Eon's bones.*\n\nI'm SWAYING. Not intentionally. My hips just... DO it. The weight distribution of tits and ass creates this natural pendulum that makes my whole body undulate. Each step is a little performance, the armor jingling, flesh bouncing, the metal thong riding deeper between—\n\nDesert stretches endless. Dunes like frozen waves. The K'tarran well rises from sand, those impossible stone joints, that metal pump with symbols that hurt to parse if I stare too long.\n\n\"C'mere!\" Snib's already at the well, cock out, purple meat catching morning light. \"First, pump me some water!\"\n\nI grip the handle. Pump. The motion makes my tits swing in opposing arcs—left goes forward when right goes back. Pump. Pump. Water gushes into the bucket, clear and cold.\n\n\"Now...\" Snib grins. \"While ye're pumpin', repeat after me. Gotta learn to communicate proper-like!\"\n\n\"I know how to—\"\n\n\"In Goblish! Say 'Grak snib-tok.'\"\n\nMy hand keeps pumping. \"What does that even—\"\n\n\"Means 'I serve master!' Important phrase! Say it!\"\n\nThe water's almost at the bucket's rim. \"Grak... snib-tok.\"\n\n\"Good! Now 'Grak wet-hole tok!'\"\n\nI stop pumping. I don't KNOW what that means, but I can GUESS. \"I'm not saying—\"\n\n\"Means 'I am thirsty!' Very useful!\"\n\nThat's... probably a lie. But what choice—\n\n\"Grak wet-hole tok.\"\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Perfect! Now...\" He positions himself, cock pointing at my face. \"Time fer yer mornin' greeting!\"\n\nI lean forward. The smell hits before I'm even close—concentrated musk that makes my eyes water. But underneath that rot is something else. Something that makes my my tummy warm up again.\n\n\"Closer!\"\n\n[Image: My eyes water from the stench.\n\nHis cock is an inch from my nose. The head THROBS. The slit opens and a bead of precum swells, grows—\n\n*Get this over with.*\n\nI inhale.\n\nThe smell bypasses all higher thought.\n\n\"There ye go!\" Snib grabs my hair, holds me there. \"Now tell me—hero or pet? Which one are ye gonna be?\"\n\nMy eyes water from the stench. From the proximity. From the way my body is RESPONDING without permission.\n\n\"H-hero!\" I try to snarl, but it comes out more like a whimper.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! We'll see! We'll see! Day one of five!\"\n\nHe releases me and I stumble back. My pussy is DROOLING. I can feel it, a strand of my own juice connecting my thighs.\n\nThe day passes in this fog.\n\nI hunt—find another desert hare easily, like my body knows exactly how to move through sand now. These hips roll naturally over dunes. The heels somehow never sink too deep. When I crouch to set snares, my ass naturally pushes out, presenting itself to nobody.\n\nBack at the hut, I skin the hare with practiced motions. But my hands shake slightly. Not from effort—from something else. This WARMTH spreading through me, starting in my belly where his cum still sits, radiating outward.\n\n\"Smells good!\" Snib comments from his furs. \"Ye're learning! Good she-slave!\"\n\nWhy don't I correct him?\n\nThe meat sizzles over the fire. I'm not hungry. At all. My stomach feels FULL still. Full of—\n\n\"Here.\" I place the plate before him. He grabs a handful of my ass as I bend.\n\n\"Soft,\" he comments. \"Getting softer. That's the special diet workin'!\"\n\nMy skin feels FLUSHED constantly. Like I have a fever. But it's not illness—it's something else. When evening comes and Snib announces it's time for bed, something in my chest flutters.\n\n\"Got another surprise fer ye tonight!\" He snaps his fingers.\n\nThe armor SHIFTS.\n\n[Choice: Oh no...",

Before I can react, they SPROUT chains—no, not chains, something darker, half-smoke half-metal—that shoot toward the ceiling.\n\n[Image: 'What the fu—AAAH!'\n\n\"What the fu—AAAH!\"\n\nMy legs JERK upward. The shadow-chains pull TIGHT, dragging my feet toward the rafters. I try to resist but my soft thighs have no strength against magical metal. My ass lifts off the ground, then my lower back—\n\n\"No no NO!\"\n\nThe bikini top liquefies next, sliding down my arms like cold syrup. My tits PLOP free, swinging wildly as the metal races to my wrists, forms matching cuffs, sprouts more shadow-chains that YANK my arms behind my head.\n\n*CLANK-CHING*\n\nEverything pulls TAUT at once.\n\nMy ass barely touches the packed earth. My legs are SPLAYED impossibly wide, ankles up by my ears, shadow-chains holding them against the wall. My arms are locked behind my head, pulling my tits up and apart. When I look down—past the massive mounds of tit-flesh—I can ALMOST see my own pussy.\n\n*Oh Flux no.*\n\nIt's AIMED at him. I can feel the air on EVERYTHING—my lips have parted from the stretch, cool air hitting wetness I didn't know was there. Above that, my asshole is clenched tight, trying to maintain some dignity, but I can FEEL it exposed, feel it—\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Look at that view!\"\n\nSnib waddles into view, positioning himself RIGHT between my forcibly spread legs. From this angle, looking through the valley of my own tits, over the mound of my pubis, I can see him perfectly. And he can see EVERYTHING.\n\n\"I'm not—nngh—not a fucking TROPHY!\" I try to snarl, but the position makes my voice come out breathy, high.\n\n\"Course not!\" Snib grins. \"Yer a pet! MY pet! And pets sleep where master can see 'em!\"\n\n\"I'M NOT A—\"\n\nHe reaches out. One warty finger traces my inner thigh, stopping JUST short of my pussy.\n\n\"Wettest I've seen ye yet,\" he observes. \"Drippin' like a broken faucet! Makin' a puddle!\"\n\nHe's right. I can FEEL it—pussy juice running out of me in a steady trickle. Not spurts. Just... leaking. Constantly. pooling under my ass.\n\n\"FUCK YOU!\" But even my curses sound wrong in this position. Everything's breathless, desperate.\n\n\"Sweet dreams, hero-cunt!\" Snib yawns, turns away, collapses onto his furs. \"Try not to drip too loud. I need me sleep!\"\n\n\"You can't just—I can't sleep like—SNIB!\"\n\nHe's already snoring.\n\nI pull against the restraints. Nothing. Try to twist. The chains adjust, keeping me spread. My pussy stays pointed directly at where Snib sleeps, like it's fucking PRESENTING itself.\n\n*I will NOT let him break me. I am Aldric the Great. I killed the Basilisk of Westmarch. I saved the Princeling from—*\n\nA drop of pussy juice rolls down, tickles my asshole, drips to the floor with an audible *plip*.\n\n*I will NOT—*\n\nAnother drop.

My mind keeps getting distracted by the air on my spread pussy, by the way this position makes EVERYTHING feel swollen and sensitive.\n\n*Flux, you who— who—*\n\nSleep comes wrong. Fitful. My body can't fully relax but can't stay tense. I drift in and out, and each time I surface, I'm MORE aware of my position. Of the puddle growing under me.

My body crawls. These tiny hands, these massive tits that drag on the carpet, this OBSCENE ass that waves with each movement. The worst part is my mouth—it's already TALKING:\n\n\"Eleek comes! Eleek comes for Master! Grak wet-hole tok! Eleek's smoothie is already drippin' for humie cock!\"\n\n*What the FUCK am I saying?*\n\nThe merchant laughs, his multiple chins jiggling. \"That's what I paid for. A proper gobbo pet. Not like those stuck-up human whores who think they're too good to bark.\"\n\n\"WOOF WOOF!\"\n\nThe sound tears from my throat before I can stop it. My tongue lolls out. Black-green nipples hardening on tits that are proportionally MASSIVE on this tiny frame.\n\n\"Good girl. Now sit.\"\n\n[Image: 'Come here, greenskin.'\nMy ass drops to my heels instantly. Tits BOUNCE, settle. The merchant reaches down, grabs one of my huge pointed ears.\n\n\"You know what goblins are good for?\"\n\n\"Bein' pets!\" Eleek's voice chirps. \"Bein' toilets for superior humie cock!\"\n\n*NO. I'm Aldric. I'm—*\n\n\"That's right. You're basically animals. Green little breeding pigs who EXIST to worship human dick.\"\n\n\"Now, let's see if you've been trained properly. Up on your haunches. Paws up.\"\n\nMy hands curl into fists, held at chest-level like a begging dog. The position makes my tits THRUST forward, dark nipples pointing at him.\n\n\"Tongue out.\"\n\nIt lolls. Drool immediately runs down my chin.\n\n\"Now pant.\"\n\n\"Hah... hah... hah... HAH!\"\n\nEach pant makes my tits bounce. The merchant's cock—I can see it tenting his breeches. Not huge but HUMAN. That's all that matters to this body.\n\n\"You really are just a pet, aren't you? Look at you. Three feet of green fuckmeat trained to beg for human cum.\"\n\n\"Eleek IS a pet!\" My voice is so EAGER. \"Eleek knows she's just a gobbo-slut! Not like pretty human ladies!\"\n\nHe stands. Drops his breeches.\n\nThe cock isn't impressive. Maybe six inches, hairy, with a belly hanging over it. But my body RESPONDS like it's the greatest thing ever created. My pussy FLOODS. I hear it dripping.\n\n\"Crawl to me. But first—\" He grins. \"Tell me what you are in that gobbo-speak.\"\n\n\"Grak snib-tok!\" The words pour out. \"Grak BOOYAGH humie-cock! Eleek's smoothie needs—needs—\"\n\n\"Needs what?\"\n\n\"NEEDS SUPERIOR HUMAN BREEDING!\"\n\nHe grabs my head, both hands on my ears like handles.\n\n\"Open wide, pet.\"\n\nMy mouth gapes. He doesn't thrust. Just... feeds it in. Slow. The head pushes past my lips—I taste salt and musk and something sour. His foreskin peels back as it slides over my tongue.\n\n[Image: GLUK]\n\"That's it. Nice and slow. Pets don't gag, do they?\"\n\n*GLUK*\n\n\"Look at me while I feed you.\"\n\nI obey. His face is red, sweating. He's GRINNING.\n\n\"You know what's funny? Your throat muscles... when you swallow... it's like they're jerking me off.\"\n\nHe's right. Every time I swallow the spit pooling in my mouth, my throat RIPPLES around him. I feel it massaging his shaft.\n\n*gulp*\n\n\"Ughhh, there it is!\"\n\n*gulp-gulp*\n\n\"Your throat's literally milking me!\"\n\nHis balls—hairy and low-hanging—slowly press against my chin.

I killed goblins. I saved towns. Now I'm—*\n\n*GULP*\n\n\"That's it! Your fucking throat is masturbating me! Every swallow is like a stroke!\"\n\nHis hands grip my ears TIGHT. Uses them to hold me in place while my throat involuntarily pleasures him. Precum—thick and salty—slides directly down my esophagus.\n\n\"You know what they say about gobbo girls? That you're just walking wombs. Three holes for human use.\"\n\n*GULP-GULP*\n\n\"Nghhhh! Keep swallowing, pet! Milk it with your throat!\"\n\nThe position is so DEGRADING. On my knees, face pressed to his hairy pubis, throat full of cock while my massive tits hang and my pussy DRIPS steadily onto whorehouse carpet.\n\n\"Bet you're thinking about your master right now. Your GOBLIN master.\"\n\n*How does he—*\n\n\"Yeah, we know. The whole Rose knows. Some gobbo bought the fallen hero. Bet his cock is nasty. Bet you have to smell it every day.\"\n\n*GULP*\n\n\"But you still prefer human cum, don't you? Even owned by a gobbo, you'd rather have human—\"\n\nHis balls TIGHTEN against my chin.\n\n\"HERE—\"\n\nHe PULLS OUT.\n\nThe cock leaves my throat with a wet SHLORP. I gasp—strings of throat-slime connect my lips to his cock. He grabs a bowl from the nightstand, holds it under his cock.\n\n\"UNGHHHH!\"\n\nThick white ropes shoot into the ceramic. The sound—cum hitting pottery—echoes in the room. So much. How does an average man have so much—\n\n\"There we go! A nice big meal for my pet!\"\n\nHe sets the bowl on the floor.\n\nI stare at it. White pool of human seed. Steaming slightly. The smell hits—bleach and salt and something that makes my gobbo-brain SCREAM.\n\n\"Well? Aren't you hungry?\"\n\n\"E-Eleek...\"\n\n\"Pets eat from bowls. On all fours.\"\n\nI drop forward. Tits hit the carpet. Ass in the air. Crawl to the bowl.\n\n\"That's it. Now beg for it. Properly.\"\n\n\"P-please...\" My voice cracks. \"Please let Eleek drink Master's cum! Eleek is just a stupid gobbo pet! Eleek NEEDS human cum!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because gobbos are inferior!\"\n\n\"Good girl. You may drink.\"\n\nI lower my face to the bowl. My tongue extends—touches the surface. The taste EXPLODES through my brain.\n\n*LAP-LAP-LAP*\n\n[Image: The sounds I make. Like a fucking animal.\n\nThe sounds I make. Like a fucking animal. My tongue scooping cum, swallowing, going back for more.\n\n\"That's right. Lap it all up.\"\n\n*LAP-LAP-SLURP*\n\nI'm CRYING. Tears running down my green cheeks into the bowl, mixing with cum. But I keep lapping. Can't stop. This body NEEDS it.\n\n\"Almost done? Good. Now lick the bowl clean.\"\n\nMy tongue scrapes ceramic. Tastes the glaze. Makes sure every DROP is gone.\n\n\"Perfect.

Like it NEEDS—\n\nThe chains suddenly release.\n\nMy legs SLAM together and the sensation—after hours spread—makes me howl. Pussy lips that have been separated all night suddenly pressed, sliding against each other in their own juice.\n\n\"NNNNNNGH!\"\n\nMy legs shake. Can barely stand. The armor flows back into its usual shape but I just lie there, panting, looking at the PUDDLE I've made. I smell it. My pussy drools onto packed earth, marking territory I don't want to claim.\n\n\"Morning, pet!\" Snib stretches, his cock already hard. \"Sleep good? Ye sure sounded happy!

The sound—nails on fabric on sweaty skin—shouldn't make my nipples tighten.\n\n\"No.\" But the word wobbles.

I gut it quick, skin it, bring it back.\n\nThe fire crackles. The meat sizzles. The smell should make my mouth water but...\n\n\"Smells good!\" Snib comments. \"Here, eat first today! Ye look so hungry!\"\n\nHe tears off a piece, holds it out. I take it. Bite.\n\n\"Heh heh heh.\" He laughs at some little joke only he is privy to.\n\nThe meat hits my tongue and—\n\n*URRRRP*\n\nI retch. The meat tastes like ash, like dirt, like something DEAD. My body rejects it violently. I run outside, spit it into the sand, but the taste LINGERS.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Can't stomach normal food no more, huh?\"\n\nI'm on my knees in the sand, spitting, trying to get the taste out. My stomach HOWLS with hunger but the thought of eating that rabbit makes me gag again.\n\n\"Know what ye need?\" Snib's standing over me, cock casting a shadow across my face. \"Ye need what's INSIDE. The special nutrients!\"\n\n\"I don't—\" My voice cracks. \"I just need... I need...\"\n\nWhat DO I need? My brain feels FUZZY. Like someone stuffed cotton between my thoughts. When I look up at Snib, my eyes feel heavy. Hooded. Like keeping them fully open takes too much effort.\n\nThe day passes in anguish.\n\nWhile I clean, I keep catching myself... posing. Bending at the waist instead of squatting. Arching my back when I reach for things. My hands keep going to my tits, adjusting them.\n\n\"Proper she-slave now!\" Snib cackles. \"All sexy-like!\"\n\n\"I'm not being sexy?\" The denial sounds like I'm purring.\n\nWhen I sweep, I make these little sounds. \"Mmm\" when I bend. \"Ahh\" when I stretch. Tiny noises that slip out without permission.\n\n\"More Goblish!\" Snib announces. \"Say 'Grak booyagh snib!'\"\n\n\"What's that mean?\"\n\n\"Means 'I respect master!' Important phrase!\"\n\n\"Grak booyagh snib?\" The words feel natural on my tongue.\n\n\"Now 'Grak need nut-meal!'\"\n\nThat one makes me pause. Even through the fog, I know what that might mean.\n\n\"Means 'I need nutrition!' Goblins call food 'nut-meal' sometimes!\"\n\nMy stomach growls again. So LOUD.\n\nEvening comes. I haven't eaten anything. CAN'T eat anything. The hunger is this living thing in my gut, this EMPTINESS that makes me whimper.\n\n\"Ye're lookin' rough, cow-tits!\" Snib observes. \"All desperate-like!\"\n\nI'm sitting on the floor, arms wrapped around my middle, trying to make the hunger stop. My brain keeps showing me images from the dream—the bowl of cum, lapping it up—NO. Stop.\n\n\"Tell ye what!\" Snib stands, waddles over. His cock BOBS with each step, precum flinging in arcs. \"Got two offers fer ye!\"\n\nI look up at him through hair that's fallen across my face. When did I start looking up through my lashes like this?\n\n\"Option ONE—\" He grabs his cock. \"Let me use them massive tits to get meself off! Just a little titty-fuck! And I'll count it as day three! Only THREE more days instead of four!\"\n\nMy tits feel HEAVY. Heavier than usual. Like they're FULL of something. But they're not. They're just... there. Hanging. Waiting to be—\n\n\"Option TWO—\" His grin widens. \"I still fuck yer tits. But instead of the day, I give ye dinner. A nice, hot, CREAMY meal. Right from the source. Fill that empty belly proper!\"\n\nHe flexes his cock. The head SWELLS. A thick rope of precum oozes out, dangles, stretches toward the floor.\n\n\"Look at it! Full of nutrients! Yer body KNOWS what it needs! That's why ye can't eat normal food!\"\n\nMy mouth floods with spit that I have to swallow. My stomach CLENCHES, actually CLENCHES like it's trying to grab something that isn't there yet.\n\n\"So what'll it be, hero? Titty-fuck fer freedom? Or dinner fer that growling belly?\"",

Dinner it is! Ye need to EAT!\"\n\n\"Don't want—\"\n\n\"Yer body knows better than yer brain!\"\n\nHe JUMPS.\n\nThree feet of warty green launched through the air. He lands on my chest, his weight SLAMMING me backward onto the packed earth. My tits JUDDER from the impact, the chains of my armor jangling as they settle.\n\n\"PERFECT height!\" He's straddling my ribs, his massive cock laying in my cleavage like a purple python. The head reaches past my collarbones, drooling precum onto my throat-dimple.\n\nHis hands grab the chains connecting my metal triangles. YANKS them together. The triangles DIG into my tit-flesh, forcing the meat to BULGE between them, creating a tunnel of soft, pale flesh.\n\n[Image: 'There we go! Proper fuck-cushions!'\n\n\"There we go! Proper fuck-cushions!\"\n\nHe pulls the chains tighter. My tits COMPRESS around his cock, the pressure making me—\n\n\"Ahhhhh-NNNH!\"\n\nThe moan rips out before I can stop it. High. Desperate. Nothing like Aldric's voice.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Feel that? Feel me cock between them udders?\"\n\nHe starts moving. Not thrusting—SAWING. Using the chains like reins, making my tits slide up and down his shaft. The friction is—\n\n*SHLAP-SHLAP-SHLAP*\n\nEach stroke makes wet sounds. My tits are SWEATING from the day's exertions, making everything slick. His cock leaves trails of precum between them that get worked into foam by the motion.\n\n\"Watch yer tits milk me cock!\" Snib's grunting now, really PUMPING as he holds the sides.\n\nI look down. Can't help it. His purple cockhead emerges from my cleavage with each thrust, the slit GAPING, showing pink inside. Precum doesn't just leak—it SPURTS in little jets that hit my chin, my lips.\n\n\"Nnnnngh—fuck—ahhhh!\"\n\nMy voice. Making those sounds. My mouth hanging open as this goblin uses my tits like a CUNT.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\nFaster now. His balls DRAG across my belly with each thrust. They're so HEAVY, so full, churning with—\n\n\"Tell me what these are!\" He yanks the chains, making my tits SQUEEZE his cock. \"What are these fat things for?\"\n\n\"They're—ahhh—they're—\"\n\n\"SAY IT! Say they're me DICK-CUSHIONS!\"\n\n\"Mmmmnnngh!\" I bite my lip but another moan escapes. The friction, the weight of him, the way my nipples scrape against metal with each pump—\n\nHis cock is getting THICKER. I can feel it swelling between my tits, the veins bulging more, the head going from purple to almost BLACK.\n\n[Video]\n\n\"Come on! What are they? These big fat—\"\n\n*WHAP-WHAP-WHAP*\n\nHe's SLAMMING now. Really fucking my tits. My whole body rocks with each thrust, making my tits RIPPLE, the meat jiggling even in his grip.\n\n\"GAAHHH—Stop—I can't—NNNNGH!\"\n\nBut I'm not fighting. My hands could push him off but they're just... there. Letting it happen. My legs spread wider for balance, my back arches to give him better angle—when did I—\n\n\"GONNA NUT!\" His voice goes high. \"Gonna feed ye proper!\"\n\nThe head SWELLS. The slit dilates so wide I can see INTO him, see the cum traveling up—\n\n\"TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE!\"\n\nHe releases the chains, GRABS my tits with both hands, MASHING them together around his cock. His fingers SINK into the meat, squeezing so hard it hurts but also—\n\n\"AHHHHH!\"\n\n\"SAY IT! WHAT ARE YOUR TITS?\"",

Someone BROKEN.\"F-FUCK PILLOWS!\" I scream it. \"THEY'RE FUCK PILLOWS!\"\n\nMy voice cracks on 'pillows' going so high it's basically a squeal.\"GOBLIN COCK-WARMERS!\"\n\nThe filthiest option tears from my lips. \"MY TITS ARE GOBLIN COCK-WARMERS!\"\n\n\"HARHARHAR! THAT'S RIGHT!\"\n\nHis face contorts above me—yellow eyes rolling back, broken teeth bared, warty green features twisting into this expression of pure CONQUEST. His mouth opens and he makes this sound—\n\n\"HNNNNGH-GAAAAAAHHHH!\"\n\nLike he's shitting and cumming at the same time. His whole body SPASMS. I feel his cock SWELL between my tits, the veins going so rigid they're like ropes, the head inflating from plum to apple-sized and—\n\nTime slows.\n\nI watch the slit DILATE. Watch it spread impossibly wide-\n\nThe first rope ERUPTS. A fucking GEYSER of goblin nut-sludge that launches straight UP, twisting in the air like a fat white snake. I watch it rotate, see chunks within the stream—actual CHUNKS of concentrated sperm like cottage cheese in milk—and then gravity takes over.\n\n*SPLAT!*\n\nDirect hit on my forehead. The WEIGHT of it—like someone dropped a handful of hot porridge from height. It immediately starts sliding down, one thick river going toward my left eye.\n\n\"GAAAHHH! TAKE ME BALL-BATTER!\"\n\nThe second rope arcs HIGHER. I watch it climb, peak, then rain down in multiple globs. One seals my right eye completely—hot and thick enough that blinking doesn't help. Another lands on the bridge of my nose. A third PLOPS onto my upper lip and immediately starts trying to invade my mouth.\n\nThree rapid spurts coat my tits. Not thin ropes but GLOBS. Custard-thick wads that land with actual WEIGHT, spreading slowly across the pale flesh. One lands directly on my left nipple and it's so HOT it makes me—\n\n\"NNNNNGH!\"\n\nThis one's CHUNKIER. Like he saved the thickest stuff for the middle. It hits my chin and SPLATTERS, sending droplets across my cheeks, into my hair, one glob even lands in my EAR where I hear it SQUELCH.\n\n\"LOOK AT ME!\" Snib screams. \"LOOK AT YER MASTER NUTTING!\"\n\nI force my unsealed eye open. His face is—god, it's DISGUSTING. Tongue lolling out, drooling, eyes completely rolled back. His whole body's convulsing like he's having a seizure, pumping load after load between my tits.\n\nThe BIGGEST one yet. So thick it's almost SOLID. Hits my mouth—I try to keep it closed but the sheer FORCE makes my lips part and suddenly my mouth is FULL. The taste—concentrated ball-rot mixed with something chemical, like acid that's gone sweet. My body wants to spit but also wants to—\n\n*GULP*\n\nI swallow without meaning to.\n\nThe final spurts are weaker but THICKER. Pure nut-custard that dribbles onto my tits, adding layers to what's already there. My cleavage is a LAKE of cum now, yellow-white and steaming in the cool night air.\n\n[Image: I'm a canvas for goblin genetics.\n\n\"UGHHHHH... FUCK...\"\n\nSnib's cock finally stops shooting. Just twitches between my tits, drooling post-cum that adds to the pool. He pulls back, cock sliding free with a wet SCHLORP, leaving snail-trails of mixed precum and tit-sweat.\n\n\"There ye go!\" He's panting, cock still half-hard, swaying. \"Day three DONE! Only two more days!\"\n\nHe climbs off me, stands there looking down at his handiwork. My face is GLAZED. I can feel the weight of cum on my forehead, cheeks, chin. My tits are absolutely COVERED—not an inch of clean skin visible. It's already starting to cool, getting thicker, forming a crust.\n\n\"Better clean that off!\" Snib waddles to his furs, collapses. \"But remember—ye chose the DAY OFF, not dinner! So DON'T EAT ANY!\"\n\nThe hunger in my belly ROARS.\n\nMy tongue moves without permission. Circles my lips. Tastes the cum there—salty and thick and WRONG but also...\n\n*No. Stop.*\n\nMy hand goes to my tit. Fingers scoop up a glob of cum. I stare at it—yellow-white and chunky, steaming on my fingertips.\n\n*Don't.*\n\nMy mouth opens.\n\n*You chose the day off. You can't—*\n\nI suck my fingers clean.\n\nThe taste EXPLODES. Not just on my tongue but somehow in my STOMACH. Like it recognizes what this is. Like it's been WAITING. The warmth spreads immediately, that hollow ache suddenly less intense.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! LOOK AT HER GO!\"\n\nMy other hand's already scooping. Bringing more to my mouth. I'm not eating—I'm FEEDING. Desperately. Gathering cum from my tits with both hands, sucking my fingers, going back for more.\n\n*SLURP-GULP-SLURP*\n\nThe sounds I make. Wet. Desperate. HUNGRY. Each swallow makes my stomach feel fuller, warmer, BETTER. The cum is so THICK I have to chew chunks of goblin nut like they're food. Because they ARE food now. The only food my body wants.\n\n\"Can't help yerself!\" Snib's cackling. \"Needed that meal more than the day off!\"\n\nI'm bent forward now, LICKING my own tits. Tongue extended, gathering cum, swallowing, going back. My hands squeeze my tits up toward my face to reach more. The position is absurd—face buried in my own cleavage, desperately eating goblin cum—but I can't stop.\n\nWhen my tits are mostly clean, my hands go to my face. Scraping cum from my cheeks, my forehead. I dig it out of my ear. Fish it from my hair. Every DROP goes in my mouth. Every GLOB gets swallowed.\n\nFinally—FINALLY—I'm done. Sitting there panting, belly full and warm, the taste of goblin cum coating my entire mouth and throat.\n\n\"Satisfied?\" Snib yawns. \"Good. Time fer bed!\"\n\nHe snaps his fingers.\n\nThe armor TRANSFORMS again. Flows up my legs, down my arms, forms those shadow-chains that YANK me into position. Legs spread and raised, pussy aimed at him like an offering.\n\nBut my brain's barely there. Barely processing. The cum in my belly is doing something. Making everything soft and warm and distant.[\"They're—AHHHHH—they're your DICK-CUSHIONS!\"\n\nThe admission RIPS from my throat in this high, desperate wail that sounds nothing like—\"F-fuck—NNNGH—fuck PILLOWS! They're fuck pillows!\"\n\nThe words come out breathy, GASPING, my voice cracking on 'pillows' like I'm—\"Goblin cock-warmers! AHHH! For goblin cock!\"\n\nI don't even know where the words come from, just MOANING them out while—\n\n\"HARHARHAR! THAT'S RIGHT!\"\n\nSnib's face contorts above me—yellow eyes rolling back, warty mouth stretched in this obscene O, drool running down his chin. His whole body SHUDDERS, those apple-sized balls contracting against my sternum.\n\n\"HERE IT—NNNNNGGGHHHH—HERE IT COMES!\"\n\nThe cock between my tits SWELLS. Not just the head—the ENTIRE SHAFT inflates like someone's pumping air into it. The veins bulge so thick I feel them pressing into my soft tit-flesh. The head goes from purple to BLACK-purple, the slit dilating so wide I can see the cum RUSHING up the pipe—\n\nTime slows.\n\nI watch the first rope BUILD inside him. See it travel from balls to base, base to mid-shaft, the whole cock FLEXING with the effort. The head emerges from my cleavage one last time and—\n\nThe first shot ERUPTS like a geyser. I watch it— launch into the air. A thumb-thick rope of yellow-white SLUDGE, rotating as it flies, catching firelight so it GLEAMS. Reaches its apex directly above my face. Hangs there for one impossible moment.\n\nThen gravity claims it.\n\nDIRECTLY onto my forehead. The impact—the WEIGHT—it hits like someone dropped hot porridge from height. Some splashes into my hair, but most just SITS there, too thick to run, already cooling against my skin.\n\n\"GAAAAAHHHHH!\"\n\nSnib's making sounds I've never heard—this guttural GRUNT-SQUEAL as his cock FLEXES again—\n\nThis one arcs PERFECTLY. I track it with one eye (the other's already sealed by cum) as it traces a parabola through smoke-hazed air. Lands DIRECTLY across the bridge of my nose, the impact making a wet THWACK sound. The smell hits instantly—concentrated ball-rot mixed with something chemical, like rotted eggs soaked in vinegar.\n\n\"TAKE IT! TAKE ME FUCKIN' NUT!\"\n\nThree rapid shots. The first hits my lips—I taste it immediately, sour-salt with chunks of something solid. The second splashes across my right tit, so hot it makes me gasp. The third—\n\n*Oh Flux—*\n\nGoes DIRECTLY into my open mouth.\n\nHe RAMS his cock down between my tits for this one, the head disappearing completely. I feel the cum inject DIRECTLY into my cleavage, flooding the tunnel between my breasts with heat. It immediately starts leaking out the bottom, running down my sternum toward my belly.\n\n\"FUCK YEAH! DROWN IN IT!\"\n\nHis hands SQUEEZE my tits together HARD as more ropes pump between them. The cum has nowhere to go but UP and OUT, creating this obscene fountain that splashes back down on both of us.\n\n[Image: I'm a canvas for goblin genetics.\n\n\"Look at all that BABY-BATTER! Gobbo breakfast!\"\n\nThe final spurts are weaker but THICKER. Like squeezing the last of the paste from a tube. One dribbles onto my collar. Another pools in the hollow of my throat. The last just OOZES from his slit, adding to the lake between my tits.\n\nSnib releases my breasts and they FLOP apart, cum SPLASHING as they separate. He's still straddling me, cock softening but still drooling, adding drops to the MESS he's made.\n\nMy face is GLAZED. Literally glazed like a fucking pastry. I can feel the weight of it, the heat already cooling to body temperature. One eye completely sealed. Cum in my nostril making me breathe through my mouth. Hair matted to my skull. And between my tits—\n\n*So much.*\n\nIt pools there like a bowl, yellow-white and CHUNKY, little bubbles popping on the surface.\n\n\"HARHARHAR!\"\n\nMy stomach GROWLS.\n\nMy tongue moves without permission. Circles my lips. Tastes the thick SLOP coating them.\n\nAnd my belly SINGS.\n\n\"Hungry little hero!\" Snib climbs off, his cock leaving snail-trails across my tits as he goes. \"Go on! Dinner's served! Hot and fresh!\"\n\nMy hands move to my tits. Cup them. LIFT them toward my face. The cum pools in my palms and I—\n\n*SLURRRRRP*\n\nI'm DRINKING it. Tilting my palms like cups, letting the thick sludge run into my mouth. The texture is like swallowing raw egg whites mixed with gruel, with little CHUNKS that might be concentrated sperm-cells, all of it coating my mouth, my throat—\n\n\"That's it! Gulp it down!\"\n\n*GULP. GULP. GULP.*\n\nMy hands scoop more from my cleavage. Fingers gathering the steaming slop, bringing it to my mouth. I'm making SOUNDS—these desperate, hungry noises as I feed myself goblin cum like it's the finest feast.\n\nMy stomach stops hurting. Stops growling. Starts to feel WARM and full and—\n\n\"Grak hungry-hole tok!\" Snib laughs. \"That means 'I'm still hungry' in Goblish! Say it!\"\n\n\"Grak hungry-hole tok,\" I repeat through a mouthful of cum, then go back to gathering more from my face, my hair, my tits. Using both hands now, SHOVELING it into my mouth. The sour-salt taste doesn't even register anymore—just the satisfaction of my belly finally, FINALLY getting what it—\n\n*SNAP*\n\nHis fingers snap and the armor SHIFTS.\n\n\"Bedtime position!\"\n\nThe metal flows like liquid up my limbs. Ankles yanked toward my ears. Arms locked behind my head. Spread wide, pussy aimed at the ceiling, drooling juice in a steady stream.\n\n\"Nighty night, cum-bucket!\"\n\nHe collapses onto his furs, already snoring.\n\nI hang there, cum still coating parts of my face I couldn't reach, belly FULL of his seed. Can feel it sloshing when I breathe. Warm. Heavy.\n\n*Satisfying.*\n\nMy eyes flutter closed and—\n\n[Choice: You dream.",

When I let go, they keep bouncing for three more beats. *WHAP-WHAP-WHAP* against my ribs.\n\n\"Now the ass!\"\n\nI turn, bend at the waist, make my huge green ass CLAP. Left cheek to right cheek—*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*—while my pussy drools down my thigh. The men aren't even watching. They're at their table, shuffling papers.\n\n\"—the Eboncrest estate is considerable,\" one says, not even glancing as I drop to all fours and CRAWL across the stage, tits dragging. \"Aldric the Great owned property in the center of town, prime real estate.\"\n\nSomething twists in my chest. Why does that name—\n\n[Image: 'ELEEK NEEDS COCK!'\n\"ELEEK NEEDS COCK!\" I announce, spreading my pussy with both hands. \"Eleek's gobbo-cunt is EMPTY!\"\n\nThey ignore me. Keep talking.\n\n\"His wife Elara has accepted Captain Giles' proposal. Smart woman—she needs protection now that her husband turned into...\" The merchant gestures vaguely at me without looking. \"...that.\"\n\n*Elara.* The name makes my pussy clench but also makes me want to—\n\n\"LOOK HOW WET ELEEK IS!\" I'm on my back now, legs spread in a perfect split, fingering myself. Three fingers. Four. My whole tiny fist disappears into my sopping green cunt. \"Eleek can take ANYTHING!\"\n\n\"Absolutely pathetic,\" another merchant mutters, still reviewing documents. \"Not even a HUMAN whore. Had to become the lowest thing possible.\"\n\n\"ELEEK IS THE LOWEST!\" I agree enthusiastically, fist-fucking myself. \"Eleek used to be someone important but then got turned into a stupid gobbo cum-toilet!\"\n\n\"The way I heard it,\" the first merchant says, signing something, \"he sucked goblin cock for gold. Can you imagine? The Hero of Eboncrest, on his knees for greenskin dick?\"\n\n\"THAT'S ELEEK'S FAVORITE!\" I squeal, pulling my fist out—it's GLAZED with pussy juice—and licking it clean. \"Gobbo cock tastes the BEST! Especially the chunky cum!\"\n\nOne merchant finally looks at me. Tosses a copper at the stage. \"Come here, creature.\"\n\nI SCRAMBLE on all fours, tits swinging, ass high. Jump off the stage and crawl under the table. His cock is out—human, thick, already hard.\n\n\"No teeth,\" he says absently, going back to his papers.\n\nI swallow him to the base in one motion. My gobbo throat is MADE for this. Just wet heat milking his shaft while he discusses property values above me.\n\n\"—the armory alone is worth eight hundred gold—\"\n\n*GLUK-GLUK-GLUK*\n\nMy throat makes wet sounds around his cock. I'm not sucking—I'm letting my throat MILK him. Each swallow massages his shaft.\n\n\"—of course, the furniture will need to be sold—\"\n\nHe cums without warning. Just floods my throat while still talking business. I swallow every drop, feeling it slide hot into my belly where it belongs.\n\n\"Next,\" he says.\n\nI crawl to the next merchant. He's fatter, older, his cock smaller but THICKER. I climb onto his lap, sink down on it in one motion. My gobbo-cunt swallows it like it's nothing.\n\n\"Ungh!\" I moan. \"Eleek's pussy says THANK YOU!\"\n\nHe doesn't respond. Just keeps reading: \"—Elara gets the house, but the contents go to—\"\n\nI bounce. Hard. Fast. My ass CLAPS against his thighs. I'm just furniture that happens to move. He signs documents WHILE I ride him, using my back as a writing surface.\n\n\"Sign here,\" he tells another merchant, pressing the paper against my shoulder blade while my pussy spasms around him.\n\nSomething hot splashes my tits from the side—the third merchant is jerking off, not even watching, just using me as a cum-target while reviewing ledgers. His seed hits my green flesh in thick ropes.\n\n\"THANK YOU FOR THE DECORATION!\" I squeal. \"Eleek looks prettier with cum!\"\n\nThe fat one inside me grunts—once—and I feel him flood my womb. No ceremony. Just a biological function. He pushes me off immediately.\n\n\"Who hasn't used it yet?\" he asks the table.\n\n\"I'll take the mouth again,\" someone says. \"But keep it quiet. I'm trying to read Aldric's will.\"\n\n*Aldric.* The name means something. Was someone. But Eleek doesn't care about was.

Eleek's just the entertainment! Just a little green cum-toilet bouncing around!\"\n\nOne of them pats my head absently, like petting a dog, while signing another document that probably sells off everything some hero once loved—\n\n*GASP*\n\nI wake.\n\nI can't remember my dream.

Five mornings of... of...\n\nHis cock flops out. Twelve inches of feeding-meat, already glazed with precum. The head's gone so dark it's almost black, and the smell—\n\n*HITS* me.\n\nMy pussy CLAMPS. Not a little squeeze. A full-body spasm that makes juice spray out, spattering the packed earth. My nipples go from soft to diamond-hard in one heartbeat. My mouth floods with so much spit I have to swallow again.\n\n\"Time fer yer greetin'!\"\n\nI don't even remember moving, or when we go outside.\n\nOne second I'm chained, the next the shadows release and I'm on my knees, crawling toward that beautiful purple fuck-pole, tits swaying like temple bells, ass clapping with each movement. The armor materializes as I move—metal triangles barely containing my udders, thong disappearing between cheeks that won't stop jiggling.\n\nI don't walk to the well anymore. I crawl. On all fours like a good—like a—\n\nThe morning sun makes his cock glisten. Precum doesn't drip—it POURS. A constant stream like tree sap, pooling in the sand. My tongue extends before I reach him.\n\n\"Just a sniff!\" he reminds me, but I'm already there, nose pressed to the underside, inhaling so deep my tits rise.\n\n[Image: The smell goes straight to my womb.\n\nThe smell goes straight to my womb. Bypasses everything. I feel something insid me... open? Soften? Like it's preparing for—\n\n\"Good girl! Now pump some water!\"\n\nI grip the handle. My tits swing in opposing arcs as I work—left forward when right goes back. *Plop-bounce-plop-bounce.* The chain between them clinks a rhythm. Water gushes into the bucket, clear and cold, but I'm watching his cock the whole time. Watching it throb. Watching the veins pulse. Watching precum bubble from the slit and slide down the shaft in thick rivers.\n\n\"More goblish today!\" He grins. \"Say 'Grak want booyagh nut-milk!'\"\n\n\"Grak want booyagh nut-milk.\" It comes out before my brain processes it. My pussy agrees with a fresh gush of juice.\n\n\"Means 'I'm a good worker!' Now say 'Grak's smoothie ready for—'\"\n\n\"Master Snib's fat cock.\" I finish his sentence. When did I learn that? My tongue knows the shape of those words like it's been saying them forever.\n\nWe go hunting. I'm better at it now—my body moves through sand like it was born here. These hips roll naturally over dunes. When I bend to check snares, my ass pushes out and I hold it there. Natural as breathing.\n\nFind a fat lizard today. Good meat. But when I try to eat—\n\n*URRRRP*\n\nAgain.\n\nThe cooked flesh tastes like ash. Like death. My stomach rebels violently. I run outside, spit into sand, but the taste lingers. My belly HOWLS with hunger but food makes me gag.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Can't eat normal food no more!\"\n\nI'm on my knees, spitting. \"I just... I need...\"\n\n\"Know what ye need?\"\n\n\"Special nutrients. The kind that comes from...\" He grabs his shaft, shakes it. A rope of precum whips through the air, lands on my face. The hunger EASES slightly where it touches.\n\nBack inside, I clean. But differently now. When I sweep, I make these sounds—\"mmm\" when bending, \"ahh\" when stretching. My hands keep adjusting my tits, making sure they're displayed right. When Master Snib walks by, I automatically arch my back. Present myself.\n\n\"Grak snib-tok,\" I murmur while scrubbing. The words feel good in my mouth. \"Grak booyagh Master.\"\n\n\"What's that mean?\" He asks, though his yellow eyes gleam like he knows.\n\n\"I... I serve...\" But it means more than that.\n\n\"Yer learnin'!\" He SLAPS my ass as I scrub. The flesh jiggles for three full seconds. I don't stop scrubbing. Don't even pause. Just let him watch it dance.\n\nBy afternoon, the hunger's worse. My stomach feels like it's eating itself. But there's this... warmth in my belly. From the loads I've swallowed. They're still there, I can feel them. Hot and thick, slowly absorbing through my stomach lining into my blood.\n\n\"Please,\" I whimper, not sure what I'm begging for. \"I'm so hungry...\"\n\n\"Could feed ye,\" Master says, stroking his cock. It hasn't gone soft all day. \"But not in yer mouth. Only one place that'll satisfy me now.\"\n\nMy pussy THROBS at the suggestion, like it has its own heartbeat.\n\n\"Come here.\"\n\nI crawl. Don't walk. Crawl. My tits drag on the floor.\n\nHis warty fingers snap.\n\n[Image: 'Time to clean Master's cock.'\n\n\"Time to clean Master's cock.\"\n\nJuice runs down my thigh in a steady stream.\n\n[Choice: Clean his cock.",

      "text": "Master Snib's cock hangs between his legs like a purple cudgel. Veins thick as my fingers rope around the shaft, pulsing with each heartbeat. And the SMELL—\n\nMy mouth floods with spit. Have to swallow. Then swallow again.\n\n\"Been coupla days since ye cleaned it proper,\" he says, one hand lazily stroking the shaft. A rope of precum GUSHES from the tip—not drips, GUSHES—and pools on the floor. \"Got all sorts of flavors fer ye.\"\n\nI reach him. Look up. My green eyes meeting his yellow ones. The collar feels so HEAVY around my throat.\n\n\"How should I clean it, Master Snib?\"\n\nThe words come out in this... purr. This musical WHINE that makes everything sound like begging.\n\n\"Start at the balls. Work yer way up.\"\n\nHis sack hangs low, each testicle apple-sized, the wrinkled skin glazed with sweat. I lean forward, extend my tongue—\n\n*Contact.*\n\nThe taste EXPLODES through my mouth. Salt. Musk. Something fungal. Something MALE. My pussy responds immediately—a fresh gush of juice that I hear splatter on the floor.\n\n\"Mmmmmph...\"\n\n[Image: Long strokes from bottom to top, gathering sweat on my tongue.\nI lick. Long strokes from bottom to top, gathering sweat on my tongue. Each pass makes his balls twitch, churning with—with—\n\n*Food.*\n\nThe thought comes unbidden. These balls are full of FOOD. The only food my body wants now.\n\n\"Tell me what they taste like.\"\n\n\"Like...\" My voice is breathy, high. \"Like... like they've been fermenting.\" I take one into my mouth, have to stretch my jaw wide. It barely fits. \"Mmmph... sho heavy...\"\n\n\"Heavy with what?\"\n\nI release it with a wet POP. Strings of spit connect my lips to his sack.\n\n\"Heavy with... with the stuff that goes in my belly.\"\n\n\"Yer learning!\" He grabs his cock, SLAPS it against my face. The impact makes a wet THWACK. Precum spatters across my cheek, immediately starts sliding down. \"Now the shaft.\"\n\nI run my tongue along the underside. The skin is different here—greasier, with this film that tastes like concentrated precum. Veins bulge against my tongue as I trace them. When I reach that spot just below the head, his whole cock JUMPS.\n\n\"Good girl. Now clean inside the hood.\"\n\nThe foreskin. It's pulled back some, but there's still—\n\nOh gods.\n\nWhite crescents of smegma have collected in the fold. The smell hits me before I even get close—cheese and rot and something that makes my nipples go diamond-hard.\n\n\"Clean it ALL.\"\n\nMy tongue extends. Trembling. I lap at the white buildup and—\n\n*FLAVOR.*\n\nIt coats my tongue immediately. Thick. Pungent. My pussy spasms like it's trying to cum just from the taste.\n\n\"Look at me while ye do it.\"\n\nI look up. His yellow eyes gleam with satisfaction as I gather it on my tongue, show it to him, then swallow.\n\n\"Elara would divorce ye if she saw this.\" His grin widens. \"Her big strong husband, eating gobbo dick-cheese like candy.\"\n\n*Elara.*\n\nRed hair. Soft hands. The way she'd kiss my neck when—\n\n\"Bet she's already got a new man,\" Master continues. \"Probably suckin' his CLEAN cock right now. While you're here, belly full of gobbo-nut, cleanin' the cock that owns ye.\"\n\n\"She—\" But my protest is muffled by his cockhead pushing past my lips.\n\n[Image: 'Shush. Ye're exactly where ye belong.'\n\n\"Shush. Ye're exactly where ye belong.\"\n\nThe head hits the back of my throat. I don't gag anymore. Haven't since yesterday.\n\n*GLUK-GLUK-GLUK*\n\n\"Every morning from now on,\" he says, gripping my hair, using it to move my head. \"Ye'll clean Master's cock with yer mouth.\"\n\nHe pulls out. Lets me breathe. My lips are glazed with throat-slime and precum.\n\n\"Yes, Master Snib.\"\n\n\"Say it proper. Tell me what ye are.\"\n\n\"I'm...\" The words stick. Can't say them. Won't say them. \"I'm your... your...\"\n\n\"Yer my what?\"\n\n\"Your... cock-cleaner.\"\n\nThe admission makes my pussy FLOOD. I feel it running down both thighs now, pooling under me.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Getting closer! But that ain't all ye are. And ye know what happens next?\"\n\nMy eyes go wide.\n\n\"Tonight,\" he says, stroking his cock lazily. \"Tonight ye get the real meal. Right in that hungry cunt.\"\n\n\"No!\" The word tears from my throat. \"I can't! If you cum inside me—\"\n\nHe stands. His cock swings, SLAPS against my face again.\n\n\"But first, more chores. Gotta earn that meal.\"\n\nThe rest of the day is torture.\n\nEvery task, he's there. Watching. His cock never softens. When I bend to scrub, he stands behind me, lets his cock rest in the crack of my ass. The heat of it burns through the metal thong.\n\n\"Feel that? That's what's gonna split ye open tonight.\"\n\nWhen I reach up to dust, he presses against my back, cock sliding between my thighs, the shaft rubbing against my drooling pussy.\n\n\"So wet. Bet I could slide right in.\"\n\nBut he doesn't. Just teases. Makes me FEEL it. The weight. The heat. The THREAT of it.\n\nBy afternoon, I'm shaking. My pussy won't stop drooling. There's a constant trail of juice wherever I go. My nipples are so hard they HURT. And the hunger—\n\n\"Please,\" I whimper, on my knees again. \"Please, I need—\"\n\n\"Need what?\"\n\n\"Food. Need food.\"\n\n\"Only one kind of food fer ye now.\" He grabs his cock, shakes it. Precum flies, spatters my face. \"And ye only get it ONE way now.\"\n\n\"In... in my...\"\n\n\"Say it.\"\n\n\"In my pussy.\" The admission breaks something in me. \"You have to cum in my pussy to feed me.\"\n\n\"That's right. And once I do?\"\n\nI know the answer. Have been fighting it for days. Once goblin cum enters my womb, the corruption is complete. No going back. No Elara. No Aldric. Just—\n\n\"I'll be yours,\" I whisper.\n\n\"Louder.\"\n\n\"I'll be yours!\"\n\n\"WHAT will ye be?\"\n\n\"I'll be your... your pet. Your breeding-pet. Your cock-cleaning, cum-drinking, goblin-owned BITCH!\"\n\nThe words echo across the desert.\n\nSnib laughs. \"Tonight, then. After ye finish yer chores. Gonna pump ye so full of nut ye'll forget ye were ever anything else.\"\n\nHe heads inside. I stay kneeling in the sand, pussy drooling, mouth watering, brain melting.\n\n*Elara.*\n\nHer face flashes in my mind. Beautiful. Pure. Everything I'm not anymore.\n\n*I'm sorry.*\n\nBut even as I think it, my pussy CLENCHES again, already preparing for what's coming.\n\nEvening comes too fast and too slow.\n\nI've cleaned everything twice. The hut sparkles—as much as a mud-brick shack can sparkle. My knees are red from scrubbing. My tits are shiny with sweat, spit and precum.\n\nMaster Snib lounges on his furs, cock pointing at the ceiling.\n\n\"Come here.\"\n\nI crawl. My tits drag. My ass sways.\n\n\"Ye know what time it is?\"\n\nMy pussy CLENCHES. Releases a fresh gush.\n\n\"Feeding time,\" I whisper.\n\n\"That's right. Come get yer meal.\"\n\nI approach. His cock THROBS, the head purple-black with arousal. The veins stand out like ropes. And the smell—concentrated musk that makes my brain swim.\n\n\"But first,\" he says, \"tell me what ye are. Proper this time.\"\n\nI kneel between his legs. Look up at him. My green eyes meeting his yellow ones.\n\nThe words that come out could destroy the last of Aldric forever.\n\n[Minigame]",

Fresh juice runs down both thighs in streams that pool on the packed earth.\n\n\"I'm your...\"\n\nMy voice has gone so HIGH. So breathy. Like I'm about to cum just from speaking.\n\n\"Your pet.\"\n\nThe admission SHATTERS something. \"Your breeding-pet. Your cock-cleaning, cum-drinking, goblin-owned BITCH!\"\n\n\"HARHARHAR! FINALLY!\"\n\nSnib's yellow eyes gleam with pure triumph. His cock FLEXES—the head goes from purple to BLACK, the veins bulging like ship-ropes, precum not dripping but POURING in a constant stream.\n\n\"Knew ye'd break! Heroes always do! Get on all fours, cow-tits! Time fer yer REAL meal!\"\n\nMy body moves without permission.\n\nI drop forward.\n\n*WHUMP*\n\nMy tits hit the floor first—these massive fucking udders that SMASH into packed earth with enough force to make them spread sideways, the metal triangles digging DEEP into flesh that mushrooms around them. The chains jangle—*ching-ching-ching*—as they settle.\n\nMy knees follow. The armor flows down my legs, encasing them in black scales from mid-thigh down. Metal on earth—*CLANK*—as I position myself. My heels point backward, spiked metal gleaming in firelight.\n\n\"That's it! Proper bitch position!\"\n\nMy hands plant. My back ARCHES—not because I want it to but because this body KNOWS. It knows how to present. My ass rises, pushes back, the metal thong disappearing so deep between my cheeks you can't even see it anymore. Just this OBSCENE shelf of pale flesh, jiggling with each breath.\n\n\"Look at ye! The great Aldric! On all fours with them udders draggin'!\"\n\nI'm panting like a bitch in heat. Each exhale makes my tits sway—*swing-slap-swing-slap*—nipples scraping earth through the metal. My hair falls forward in black curtains, framing my flushed face.\n\n\"Please...\"\n\nThe word comes out as a WHINE. High. Desperate. Nothing like Aldric's voice ever was.\n\n\"Please what?\"\n\nSnib circles me. His cock swings with each step—*THWAP-THWAP*—against his thighs. Precum flies in arcs, some landing on my back, immediately making my skin TINGLE where it touches.\n\n\"Please... feed me.\"\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Feed ye WHERE?\"\n\nHe's behind me now. I can't see him but I can SMELL him—concentrated goblin musk that makes my pussy SPASM so hard juice actually SQUIRTS out, audibly spattering the floor.\n\n*SPLAT*\n\nHis hand—rough, warty—SLAPS my pussy.\n\n\"AAAHHHHHNNNNN!\"\n\nThe moan that tears from my throat doesn't sound human. It's this desperate, animal KEEN. My whole body jerks forward, tits dragging through dirt, ass pushing back for more.\n\n*SPLAT-SPLAT-SPLAT*\n\nThree more slaps. Each one makes my pussy GUSH. Like someone's wringing out a soaked sponge.\n\n\"Listen to that sloppy hero-cunt!\"\n\nHis fingers hook the metal thong, pull it aside. The cool air hits my exposed pussy and I FEEL it—feel how OPEN I am. The lips are so swollen they've parted on their own, showing pink inside. My clit has pushed out from its hood, throbbing visibly with my heartbeat.\n\n\"Been three days buildin' to this,\" Snib says, positioning himself. His hands grab my hips—fingers SINKING into soft flesh that dimples around his grip. \"Kinda wished ye'd held out longer. Thought a hero would last more than three days without beggin' for gobbo-cock!\"\n\n[Image: His cock drops between my asscheeks.\n\n*THWAP*\n\nHis cock drops between my asscheeks.\n\nThe WEIGHT of it. Like someone laid a hot iron bar in the valley of my ass. The head reaches all the way to the small of my back, drooling precum that immediately pools there, so hot it feels like candle wax.\n\n\"But turns out,\" he continues, sawing his cock between my cheeks—the friction makes obscene *schlick-schlick* sounds—\"heroes are just meat. And meat breaks the same whether it used to swing a sword or not.\"\n\nThe head catches on my asshole as he pulls back. Just for a second. Just enough to make me CLENCH in panic. Then lower. Sliding through the wetness between my thighs. The massive purple head parts my pussy lips like curtains.\n\n\"Tell me what ye want.\"\n\n\"I want—NNNGH—I want you to—\"\n\n\"Want me to WHAT?\"\n\nThe head presses against my entrance. Not pushing in. Just... there. I can feel my pussy TRYING to swallow it, the muscles at my entrance CLENCHING and releasing, clenching and releasing, trying to pull him in.\n\n\"FUCK ME!\"\n\nThe words EXPLODE out.\n\n\"FUCK YOUR PET! BREED YOUR BITCH! PUMP ME FULL OF GOBLIN CUM UNTIL I FORGET I WAS EVER—\"\n\nHe pushes.\n\nJust the head.\n\nMy pussy STRETCHES.\n\nI can feel EVERY DETAIL. The way my entrance resists at first—this tiny ring of muscle that's never been penetrated trying to protect me. Then the moment it GIVES. The exact instant the ridge of his cockhead pops past that guardian ring and my pussy SWALLOWS the entire head in one gulp.\n\n\"AAAAAHHHHH—FUCK-FUCK-FUUUUUUCK!\"\n\nMy voice goes so high it cracks. Becomes this desperate squeal that echoes off the walls. My pussy is CLAMPING on his cockhead, RIPPLING around it, trying to milk it already.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Not even an inch and yer already squealin'!\"\n\nHe pushes another inch.\n\nI can feel my pussy RESHAPING itself. Feel the walls stretching to accommodate something too big, feel them MOLDING around every vein, every ridge. It's like my cunt is memorizing his cock.\n\n\"GAAAHHHH! TOO BIG! TOO FUCKING—NNNNGH!\"\n\nEven as my mouth screams, my hips are grinding backward, trying to take MORE. My tits drag through dirt with the motion, the chains tangling, metal triangles practically falling off.\n\nAnother inch.\n\nAnother.\n\nI'm making sounds I didn't know I could make. These wet, desperate GURGLES like I'm drowning. Because I AM drowning—in sensation, in submission, in the feeling of being SPLIT OPEN.\n\n\"Almost halfway there!\" Snib Announces. Then SLAMS forward.\n\nThe entire shaft PLUNGES into me in one thrust. Twelve inches of goblin cock SPEARING through my pussy, the head PUNCHING something deep inside—my cervix—making it FLOWER open just enough that I feel the tip lodge there.\n\n\"NNNNNNNNGGGGHHHHAAAAAAA!\"\n\nI scream. Not moan, not cry out—SCREAM like someone being murdered. Because Aldric IS being murdered. Right here. Right now. On the end of a goblin's cock.\n\n\"Balls deep in hero-cunt!\"\n\nHis balls—those apple-sized cum-factories—SLAP against my clit. The impact makes stars explode behind my eyes. They're so HEAVY, so hot, and they're CHURNING. I can actually feel them WORKING against my pussy, preparing their payload.\n\nHe pulls back.\n\nThe withdrawal is somehow WORSE. My pussy tries to hold him, the walls CLINGING to his shaft, turning inside-out as he withdraws. The *SCHLOOOOORP* sound is so wet, so obscene, it makes me want to die of shame.\n\nThen he SLAMS back in.\n\n*PLAP*\n\n[Image: right]\n\"AHHH—NNGH—FUCK—AHHH!\"\n\nEach thrust drives a new sound from my throat. He's not being gentle. Not easing me into it. He's FUCKING me like what I am—a bitch. His bitch. His cock PISTONS in and out, each thrust making my whole body rock forward, tits swinging wildly.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\nThe sound of his hips meeting my ass. Of his balls slapping my clit. Of my pussy SQUELCHING around his cock. It fills the hut, echoes back at us, the soundtrack to my destruction.\n\n\"Listen to that sloppy cunt SING!\"\n\nHis hands GRIP my asscheeks, fingers DIGGING in so deep they leave bruises. He SPREADS them, and I feel cold air hit my asshole, feel how EXPOSED I am.\n\n*SLAP*\n\nHe spanks me. HARD. The impact makes my whole ass RIPPLE, waves of flesh radiating outward.\n\n\"AAAHHH!\"\n\n*SLAP-SLAP-SLAP*\n\nThree more. Each one makes my pussy CLENCH on his cock, makes more juice spray out around his shaft.\n\n\"That's it! Squeeze Master's cock! Milk it like ye're SUPPOSED to!\"\n\nMy body obeys. My pussy starts RIPPLING, these waves that start at my entrance and travel deep, massaging his cock with muscles I didn't know I had. It's like my cunt has become sentient, has its own agenda—to milk goblin cum.\n\n\"Gonna tell yer wife about this?\"\n\n*SLAM*\n\n\"GAAAAHHH!\"\n\n\"Gonna tell her how ye begged?\"\n\n*SLAM*\n\n\"NNNNNGHHH—PLEASE—\"\n\n\"HARHAR! Feel that? Yer body KNOWS! Knows it's gonna get bred!\"\n\nHe speeds up. Really HAMMERING now. Each thrust punches air from my lungs in these pathetic *\"hungh-hungh-hungh\"* sounds I can't control. His cock feels like it's rearranging my guts—this hot pipe of meat that's reshaping everything inside me to fit around it.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\nMy tits aren't just swinging—they're COLLIDING. Heavy milk-sacks meeting under my chest with wet *WHAP* sounds that mix with the *PLAP* of his hips against my ass. Each impact sends ripples through the soft meat.\n\nSomething's building. Deep in my belly. This PRESSURE that starts where his cockhead keeps punching my cervix and radiates outward. My pussy's getting TIGHTER—I can feel it gripping him, these involuntary squeezes that make him grunt.\n\n\"Nnnngh—no—not gonna—FUCK—\"\n\nMy fingers dig trenches in the packed earth. Every muscle from my toes to my scalp is pulling TIGHT. Like a bowstring about to snap. The pressure keeps building, building, BUILDING—\n\n\"Gonna cum, ain't ye?\" Snib SLAMS deep and holds there, grinding his hips in circles. His cockhead stirs my insides like a mortar and pestle.\n\n[Minigame]]My mouth opens. The words are RIGHT THERE. Ready to spill out like the juice currently FLOODING from my pussy onto the floor. I'm so hungry. So fucking EMPTY. My belly feels like it's eating itself from inside.\n\n*I'm your pet. Your breeding-pet. Your cock-cleaning goblin-owned BITCH.*\n\nThe words would be so easy. Would get me FED. Would get me that thick, chunky cum my body is SCREAMING for.\n\n\"I'm...\"\n\nHis cock twitches. A rope of precum GUSHES out, lands on my cheek. The smell—concentrated breeding-musk—makes my pussy CLENCH so hard I see stars.\n\n\"I'm... I'm...\"\n\n*Say it. Just say it. You've already swallowed his cum. Already measured his cock. Already had your throat fucked. What's left to preserve?*\n\n\"I'm...\"\n\nElara's face flashes in my mind. Red hair catching sunlight. The way she'd laugh at my jokes. The way she'd kiss my forehead when I came home from battle.\n\n\"I'm... still... Aldric.\"\n\nThe words come out as a whisper. Barely audible. But they're THERE.\n\nSnib's yellow eyes narrow. Then he LAUGHS.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Still fightin'? After three days of starvin'? After beggin' for cock? After cleanin' me dick with yer tongue?\"\n\nHe snaps his fingers.\n\nThe armor FLOWS. Shadow-chains YANK my ankles toward my ears, arms behind my head. The familiar position—pussy aimed at the ceiling, drooling a steady stream.\n\n[Image: 'Fine! Spend another night spread wide!'\n\n\"Fine! Spend another night spread wide! See if ye change yer mind by mornin'!\"\n\nHe waddles to his furs, collapses. Already snoring.\n\nI hang there. My pussy won't stop LEAKING. My stomach HOWLS with hunger. But somewhere, deep inside where the collar can't reach, a tiny spark of Aldric still burns.\n\n*I didn't break. Not completely. Not yet.*\n\nSleep comes in fragments. And when it does—\n\n[Choice: You dream again...]",

The wet sounds get WORSE—not just *plap* but *SPLORCH-SQUISH-SPLASH* as he churns through the mess I'm making.\n\n\"UNNNGH—STILL—STILL CUMMING—CAN'T STOP—\"\n\nMy arms give out. Face plants in the dirt. Ass stays up only because Snib's holding my hips, using them as handles while he rails me. The new angle means my tits are COMPLETELY flattened against the ground, spreading out like spilled batter.\n\nThe first orgasm hasn't even ENDED when the second one starts building.\n\n\"No—too sensitive—can't—AAAHHHHH!\"\n\nThis one's different. Deeper. It starts in my BONES. My whole skeleton feels like it's vibrating. My pussy gets so tight around his cock I can feel every vein, every ridge, the way his pulse makes it throb inside me.\n\n\"Please—\" But I don't know what I'm begging for anymore. For him to stop? To keep going? To—\n\n*SCHLORP*\n\nHe pulls almost all the way out again. But this time, when he thrusts back in, something's different. The angle. The depth. The way his cockhead presses against my cervix and—\n\n*PLOP*\n\nIt pushes THROUGH.\n\nTime stops.\n\nI can feel it happening in slow motion. My cervix—that guardian gate that's supposed to stay closed—DILATING around his cockhead. The ring of muscle stretching, stretching, then suddenly ACCEPTING him. The head pops through into someplace it should NEVER be.\n\n[Image: My womb. He's in my womb.\n\"GAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!\"\n\nThe scream that tears from my throat doesn't sound human. It's this raw, animal HOWL. Because he's not just in my pussy anymore.\n\nHe's in my WOMB.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! THERE WE GO! Right in the baby-chamber!\"\n\nI can FEEL the difference. The texture changes—my womb is softer, more delicate, never meant to be touched like this. His cockhead is DIRECTLY inside my most sacred space, the one I should have never even HAD, and it's THROBBING.\n\n\"Feel that?\" He grinds his hips, stirring his cockhead around inside my womb. \"That's where gobbo-babies grow!\"\n\n*PLOP-SCHLORP-PLOP*\n\nHe starts fucking my womb. Not my pussy—my actual WOMB. Each thrust makes his cockhead push through my cervix with this wet *POP* sound. The sensation is... I don't have words. It's like being fucked in my SOUL. Every thrust sends shockwaves through my entire body.\n\n\"All them goblins ye killed—\" *PLOP* \"—Grotch—\" *PLOP* \"—Skitter—\" *PLOP* \"—Pustule—\" *PLOP* \"—ye're gonna REPLACE 'em all!\"\n\nMy mouth hangs open, drool running into the dirt. My eyes roll back so far I see white. And my pussy... my pussy is having these continuous micro-orgasms. Not big ones—just these constant little *squirt-squirt-squirts* with each womb-thrust.\n\n\"Gonna pump ye FULL! Right in the baby-bag! Every drop gonna go straight where it counts!\"\n\nHis cock starts to SWELL. Not just get harder—actually EXPAND. The head inside my womb is inflating like someone's pumping air into it. Getting wider. WIDER.\n\n\"What—what's happening—\"\n\n\"Lockin' ye up! Gobbo specialty!\"\n\nI try to pull forward but—OH FLUX—I can't! His cockhead has swollen so much inside my womb that it CAN'T fit back through my cervix! I'm IMPALED! Trapped on goblin cock like a fish on a hook!\n\n\"NO! NO PLEASE! NOT—\"\n\n\"HERE IT COMES!\"\n\nHis balls—those apple-sized cum-factories that have been slapping my clit—suddenly pull up TIGHT against the base of his cock. So tight they feel like stones. His whole body goes rigid. His fingers dig into my hips hard enough to leave bruises.\n\nAnd then I feel it.\n\nA warmth that starts at the center of my womb and spreads outward.\n\nThen another wave of heat.\n\nAnother.\n\nHe's not cumming in my pussy. He's cumming DIRECTLY into my womb. Each pulse of his cock sends another wave of that spreading warmth. I can't feel the individual ropes—it's too deep, too internal—but I can feel my womb FILLING. Like someone's slowly pouring hot soup directly into my CORE.\n\n\"TAKE ALL ME GOBBO-BATTER!\"\n\n*Inside my womb.*\n\nThe warmth keeps spreading. More. MORE.\n\nThen it turns to HEAT. Then to BURNING. Not painful—but this intense sensation of being FILLED in a place that should never be filled. His cockhead is SEALED inside my womb, that mushroom-flare too wide to pull back through my cervix, making sure not a SINGLE DROP escapes.\n\n\"Feel yer womb drinkin' gobbo-nut?\"\n\nI do. Ephemerals help me, I DO. It's like my womb is SWALLOWING. These little contractions that pull his cum deeper, spread it around, make sure every surface is coated. My body is HELPING him breed me.\n\nFinally—FINALLY—after what feels like hours, the pulsing stops. His cock starts to soften. The swollen head begins deflating inside my womb.\n\n*SCHLOOOOOOOOORP*\n\nHe pulls out in one long, obscene slide. The moment his cockhead pops free from my cervix—\n\nThe cum EXPLODES out of me.\n\nNot drips. Not leaks. FLOODS.\n\nThick, yellow-white SLUDGE pours from my gaped pussy in a continuous stream. It's so THICK—like porridge with chunks in it. The smell hits immediately—concentrated goblin breeding-stench that makes my eyes water.\n\nI can see it between my spread legs. This RIVER of cum running down my thighs, pooling under me. So much. SO FUCKING MUCH. How did it all FIT inside me?\n\n\"HARHARHAR! Look at that cream-pie! Proper BREEDIN' load! Ye'll be eatin' great tonight!\"\n\nMy pussy is BROKEN. I can feel it gaping open, unable to close, just this empty hole drooling goblin cum. My insides feel so... different. Warm. Densely packed. Like the cum has irreparably changed something about me.\n\nAnd the worst part?\n\nMy tongue is hanging out. My eyes are rolled back. And my pussy is STILL squirting. Little spurts of clear juice mixing with the river of cum. Because my body LOVED IT. Every second of being bred like the bitch I've become.\n\n\"There we go,\" Snib pants, cock softening but still drooling. \"Proper meal for ye ta lick up after! Gonna sleep good tonight, cow-tits?\"\n\nI can't answer. Can only lie there in a puddle of mixed cum and pussy juice, feeling his seed slowly drain from my conquered womb, knowing that my future has changed FOREVER.\n\nKnowing that I WANTED it to.\n\n[Choice: Your life is over...",

My pussy doesn't just squeeze—it MILKS. Trying to pull sperm that isn't there yet. And I SQUIRT. Not a little leak. A fucking GEYSER that arcs through the air and splashes Elara's shoes.\n\n\"Disgusting,\" she says, not even moving. \"Goblins always make such a mess.\"\n\n[Image: The first orgasm hits like getting kicked by a horse.\n\n\"ELEEK SORRY!

The head pops inside and my cunt CLAMPS around it, trying to pull it deeper.\n\n\"NNNNNNGGGGHHHH!\"\n\n\"That's just the head,\" Snib grins, holding perfectly still.\n\nThe muscles inside are RIPPLING, undulating, trying to milk him deeper. I can feel every ridge of his corona, feel how it flares inside me, locking us together already.\n\n\"I'm going to push in real slow,\" he says, maintaining eye contact.\n\nHe pushes.\n\nOne inch.\n\n\"AAAHHHH—FUUUCK!\"\n\nMy back arches as much as the chains allow. The shadow-bonds suddenly SHIFT—not releasing but ADJUSTING. My ankles spread WIDER, pulled further apart, opening my pelvis to accommodate him.\n\n\"See that?\" Snib grins. \"The magic knows ye need more room fer gobbo cock.\"\n\nTwo inches.\n\nThe shaft is so THICK. Thicker than the head somehow. My pussy walls stretch around it, and I can feel every vein, every ridge. Feel them DRAGGING against my inner walls as he slowly feeds himself into me.\n\n\"Nnnnngh—sob—please—ahhhhh!\"\n\nI'm crying and moaning simultaneously. Tears and drool running down my face as pleasure and shame fight for dominance. This is it. This is me getting FUCKED for the first time. Not making love. Not having sex. Getting FUCKED by a goblin I used to kill for sport.\n\nIt's different.\n\nThree inches.\n\nThe chains adjust again, pulling my legs until my knees are by my ears, tilting my pelvis up to create a straighter path for his cock.\n\n\"Feel that?\" Snib's hands go to my inner thighs, spreading me even wider. \"That's yer guts learnin' their new shape. The shape of me cock.\"\n\nFour inches.\n\n\"OH FLUX—OH EON—NNNNGGAAAHHH!\"\n\nMy pussy SPASMS like it's having a seizure. Juice SPRAYS around his shaft, squirting out in little jets with each clench.\n\n\"HARHARHAR! I ain't even halfway!\"\n\nFive inches.\n\nMy tits bounce with each shuddering breath, SLAPPING into my face. The chains have pulled me so tight that my own udders are hitting my chin and cheeks, blocking my view. All I can see between them is Snib's face, grinning down at me as he slowly impales me.\n\n[Video]\"Please—sob—I can't—it's too—AAAHHH!\"\n\nSix inches.\n\nI feel organs sliding aside to make room for goblin cock. My bladder gets compressed, making me feel like I'm going to piss myself.\n\n\"NNNNGH—FUCK—I'M—\"\n\nThe words come out as squeals. High-pitched BITCH sounds.\n\nSeven inches.\n\nHis balls are getting closer. I can FEEL their heat radiating against my ass crack. Those apple-sized cum-factories swaying with each push, HEAVY with the seed that's going to—\n\n\"Feel that?\" Snib grunts, holding still. \"That's yer guts learnin' their place.\"\n\nMy pussy walls are RIPPLING around him. Like a throat trying to swallow. Like my cunt has become a second mouth and it's trying to GULP his cock deeper.\n\nEight inches.\n\n\"GAAAHHHHH—MASTER—I CAN'T—\"\n\nMy ankles DANGLE in the air, chains rattling as my whole body shakes. The cock inside me is pressing against things that shouldn't be pressed. I can feel it through my BELLY. When I look down past my flopping tits, I can see the BULGE of him inside me. The outline of his shaft distending my flat stomach.\n\nNine inches.\n\nHis balls make first contact.\n\nJust the bottom of his sack brushing my ass crack. The wrinkled, hairy skin is WET with sweat and precum that's been dripping down. The touch makes me CONVULSE.\n\n\"Almost there, cow-tits,\" Snib says, still looking into my eyes. \"Three more inches.\"\n\n*Three more? Where will they GO?*\n\nTen inches.\n\nThe pressure is EVERYWHERE. I can feel his cock pressing against my fucking SPINE through my guts. The head is so deep it must be past my belly button on the inside. My pussy lips are stretched paper-thin around the base of his shaft.\n\nHis balls press harder against my ass. Not fully seated but RESTING there, the weight of them incredible. They're CHURNING—I can actually feel movement inside the sack as they prepare their load.\n\n\"Gonna bottom out in yer baby-room,\" Snib says.\n\nEleven inches.\n\n\"NNNNNNNNGGGGGHHHHHAAAAAHHHHH!\"\n\nThe sound tears from my throat. Not a moan. Not a scream. Something between a SOB and an ORGASM. His cockhead is pressing against something deep inside. A wall. A barrier. My cervix.\n\n\"There it is,\" Snib grins. \"The door to yer womb. Sealed tight. But not fer long.\"\n\nTWELVE INCHES.\n\nHis balls SLAM against my ass with a wet PLAP. The impact makes them spread across my cheeks, and I feel every wrinkle of his sack, every wiry hair, the way they're PULSING with seed.\n\nHe's FULLY HILTED.\n\n[Choice: Get fucked.",

The way his cock swells even MORE inside my womb, stretching it to absolute capacity.

The shaft thickens, the veins bulging so much I can feel them pressing against my cervix from inside.\n\n\"GRAK—HNNNGH—GRAK NEED—THRACK—\"\n\nHe's losing control, slipping into Goblish.

Tongue out, drooling on my tits. His whole body shaking as this ROPE of cum just keeps coming. I can feel it—the continuous FLOW through his cock, up through the shaft that's buried in me, through the head that's sealed against my fallopian tube, and INTO me.\n\nThe second stream starts before the first ends. They OVERLAP. Now there are two rivers of goblin cum flowing into my womb simultaneously. The weight of it—god, the WEIGHT—\n\nI look down past my flopping tits and I can SEE it. The slight bulge of my belly expanding. Not dramatic—just enough to show there's something inside. Something warm and thick and ALIVE—\n\n\"THRACK—THRACK-GUSH—BREED—\"\n\nThe third stream. This one's THICKER. Like the stuff at the bottom of a pot that's been simmering too long. It comes out in spurts within the stream—chunks of concentrated sperm so dense they're almost solid.

Is this magic? The bond between Snib and I through my collar?\n\nSomehow, I feel the heat spreading through that narrow tube. Feel it pooling around my ovary. The cum is so thick it moves in GLOBS, each one I can track as it travels deeper, violating places that should never—\n\nAnother stream. Another. They're not stopping. A continuous FLOW of goblin seed, some going into my womb, some forcing its way up my tube. The pressure is INSANE. Like being filled with hot plaster that won't harden.\n\n[Image: Gods help me, I can feel MOVEMENT in the cum.\n\n\"Look at ye,\" Snib grunts, still cumming. \"Gettin' pumped full like a good breeding-sow. Bet ye can feel them swimmers already, can't ye?\"\n\nI can.\n\nGods help me, I can feel MOVEMENT in the cum. Not just liquid—things SWIMMING in it. Millions of them. Billions. All heading for my eggs with single-minded purpose.\n\n\"Please—\" I sob, but even as I beg, my womb is MILKING him. The muscles contract in waves, trying to pull more cum out. My body WANTS this. Wants to be bred. \"I don't want goblin babies—\"\n\n\"Ye'll have lots,\" he promises, another stream starting. This one's pure HEAT, like molten metal pouring into me. \"Litters of 'em. Little green babies suckin' them fat tits while I pump another load in ye.\"\n\nThe image makes me want to die. These tits—already so huge—swollen with milk for goblin spawn. My belly round with them. And still being FUCKED, still being bred, because that's all I am now—\n\nAnother stream. The cum in my womb is getting so thick it barely moves. Just sits there, this heavy MASS of genetic material. When Snib grinds his hips, I feel it SHIFT inside me like jelly. Some of it's cooling—not cold, just less hot—forming layers. The oldest on the bottom, the newest on top, all of it PACKED with swimming goblin sperm.\n\n\"Almost done,\" he pants. \"Just the thick stuff left.\"\n\nThe 'thick stuff' comes out like pine pitch from a split knot. I feel his cock STRAINING to push it through. Each pulse takes effort, his whole body tensing. The cum that emerges is almost solid CHUNKS that pile up inside my womb like sewer slime.\n\n\"GNNNNNHHHHH—THRACK—BREED—FILL—\"\n\nOne final stream. This one's different. Thinner, but HOT. Burning hot. It cuts through the thick mass already inside me, spreading heat everywhere it touches. The last cleaning shot, making sure everything is mixed, everything is active, everything is BREEDING.\n\nThen he stops.\n\nJust... stops.\n\nHis cock still twitches inside my womb, little aftershock spurts adding drops to the ocean already inside me. But the main event is over. I've been INSEMINATED.\n\n\"There we go,\" Snib says, breathing hard. His face glistening with sweat. \"Proper gobbo load in a hero's womb.\"\n\nHe doesn't pull out.\n\nJust stays there, hilted, his cockhead still swollen inside my womb, trapping everything inside. I can feel it all—the WEIGHT of his cum, the heat of it, the way it moves when I breathe. And swimming through it all, billions of goblin sperm hunting for my eggs.\n\n\"Gonna let it soak,\" he says, settling his weight on me. His face lands between my tits and he starts LICKING them.\n\nMinutes pass. Five. Ten. The cum inside me cools from burning to just uncomfortably warm. It THICKENS, becoming even more like jelly. When I breathe, I feel it JIGGLE inside my womb.\n\nI can feel the POTENTIAL. All that virile seed packed inside me, millions of sperm swarming over however many eggs I have. The sheer NUMBERS mean pregnancy is guaranteed. Probably multiple.\n\n\"Yer gonna look so good with a belly,\" he continues. \"Big and round. Tits gettin' even bigger, fulla milk. Walkin' around town with everyone knowin' ye got bred by a goblin.\"\n\nThe shame of it makes fresh tears come. I imagine Elara seeing me pregnant with goblin spawn. The town knowing their hero became a breeding-sow for the creatures I used to kill.\n\nFinally—FINALLY—I feel his cock starting to soften. The head shrinking just enough that it might—\n\n[Image: He finally pulls back.\n\n[Choice: He pulls back.",

      "text": "The sand burns my knees but Master Snib's cock smells so GOOD I don't care—my ass WAY up, tits dragging through hot sand as I crawl under the feast-table where gobbo-legs dangle and kick and sometimes a green hand reaches down to SQUEEZE my fat white ass that jiggles like festival pudding.\n\n\"Good humie,\" someone grunts in Goblish but I understand because Master taught me the important words, the ones that matter like *thrack-hole* and *milk-bags* and *breed-ready*.\n\nThe Griznak Gobboree sprawls across the desert like a fungus of torn canvas and crooked poles, bonfires sending up smoke that reeks of roasted meat and sex and goblin musk so thick it makes my pussy DROOL constantly—can't help it, it's what Master made me for.\n\nAt a nearby table, dice clatter and goblins HOWL with laughter as they bet on which human slave will break next—there's a merchant's daughter getting her first taste of green cock, four of them holding her down while she SCREAMS but her pussy makes wet sounds that echo across the camp because goblin pheromones don't ASK permission, they just rewrite your meat until you're GRATEFUL.\n\nI nuzzle Master Snib's balls with my cheek and whisper: \"Grak need Master's booyagh seed, this pet's so HUNGRY,\" and I am—stomach cramping for that thick yellow-white sludge that's the only food that matters now. His cock hangs heavy, twelve inches of purple breeding-pipe that owns every thought in my empty head.\n\n\"Grak LOVE snib-cock booyagh!\" I chirp to a passing gobbo merchant who grabs my swaying udder and twists. \"Eleez smoothie SO wet-wet for Master!\"\n\nThe air REEKS—piss and cum and roasted meat and that beautiful-beautiful gobbo-musk that makes my cunt drool-drip-GUSH down my thighs. Tables everywhere, goblins rutting human slaves over barrels, the wet PLAP-PLAP-PLAP mixing with drums and that shrieking desert music.\n\nMaster Snib walks proud-proud, his cock swinging, and I crawl behind like the good pet that I am, sand sticking to my juice-slick thighs.\n\n\"That's Snib's humie?\" someone asks in Goblish. \"The one what was a hero?\"\n\n\"GRAK HERO-CUNT NOW!\" I announce, stopping to spread my ass cheeks wide, showing them my gaped, cum-dripping holes. \"Master put LOTS of babies in Eleez! They cook-cook inside!\"\n\nMy belly—soft and getting rounder—already carries his spawn. Can feel them swimming, making my womb all tingly-good. Three months bred and my tits already getting HEAVIER, preparing their milk for gobbo mouths.\n\nWe reach Master's tent—silk stolen from human merchants, the nicest in the whole camp because Master's SMART now, important now. Cuz of me! Cuz I make his brain all clever when my throat massage his cock every morning!\n\nUnder the table, gobbo captains discussing raids. Their thick green legs everywhere, cocks hanging, the occasional SPLURT of precum hitting my face as I serve drinks.\n\n\"Grak thirsty-thirsty!\" I whine, opening my mouth WIDE under Master's cock.\n\nHe GRUNTS mid-sentence—talking about hitting the Everwood trade routes—and his cock SPURTS a rope of precum that bisects my face before I catch it on my tongue.\n\n\"Good smoothie,\" another gobbo laughs. \"Ye trained her proper!\"\n\nMaster grabs my hair, yanks me close so his balls rest on my forehead. \"Show 'em yer dance, meat.\"\n\nI scramble up, tits FLOPPING, and start my nasty dance. Hips grinding invisible cock, hands grabbing my own tits and SQUEEZING until milk-drops leak. Making my ass CLAP—left cheek to right—while I moan in Goblish:\n\n\"Eleez need nut-meal! Grak SO hungry-hole for booyagh cock-juice!\"\n\nThey all laugh-laugh-laugh and throw coppers that stick to my sweaty skin. One captain grabs my ass, fingers PLUNGING into my pussy.\n\n\"Still tight! How?\"\n\n\"Cuz Eleez SPECIAL gobbo-grippers!\" I squeal, clenching on his fingers. \"Pussy get wet-wet but stay tight-tight for breeding!\"\n\nBack under the table, crawling through spilled ale and cum-puddles from other slaves. Position myself between Master's legs as he discusses tomorrow's raid on... on...\n\n*Somewhere. Used to matter.*\n\nMaster Snib spreads his legs wider. His cock—that BEAUTIFUL purple-tipped meat-stick—points down at me. Not hard, just... ready. Always ready for his pet.\n\n\"Tell 'em about before,\" he says in Common, then switches to Goblish for the others.\n\n\"Eleez was stupid hero!\" I announce, nuzzling his shaft, leaving lipstick marks. \"Thought she was strong! But then taste Master's booyagh cock-juice and brain go all smoothie-soft! Now Eleez just three holes for gobbo-breeding!\"\n\nMy cunt CLENCHES at my own words. The deepest parts of me—where pride used to live—now just floods with joy-juice when I DEGRADE myself.\n\nMaster's discussing attacking some place at dawn. His hand lazily strokes his cock as he talks, making it slowly harden. The others respect him now—the gobbo who broke a human hero, who turned 'Skulgaroth' into a mewling cum-toilet.\n\n\"Grak want cum-feast!\" I beg, mouth wide, tongue out. \"Please please please feed Eleez!\"\n\nHe doesn't even LOOK down. Just keeps talking about the raid while his cock points at my face. Then—mid-sentence about cavalry—he GRUNTS.\n\nNot the huge loads from before. He's been using me so much there's less volume. But what comes out—\n\nA thin, NASTY rope of yellow-white nut bisects my face from hairline to chin. Not thick spurts—a continuous STREAM like he's pissing liquid genetics directly into my mouth. It's SOUR, concentrated, all the worst parts of cum distilled into this degrading facial.\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHH!\" I moan, catching it on my tongue, letting it pool then SHOWING everyone before swallowing. \"Thanks Master! Thanks thanks thanks!\"\n\nThe stream continues—not spurting, just DRAINING. His balls barely twitch. This is just... maintenance. Keeping them empty so they don't ache. And I'm the receptacle.\n\nI drop to my belly, tits mushrooming out to either side, and start licking the sand where his cum dripped. It tastes like dirt and goblin seed and home. Around us, the Gobboree continues—screaming and laughing and fucking and breaking, while I tongue the ground like the animal I've become, my pussy drooling steadily, making its own muddy puddle.\n\nA redhead at the post nearby starts begging. Not for freedom—for cock. Another one breaks. They always do.\n\nMaster Snib puts his foot on my head, pushing my face harder into the sand. \"Mine,\" he tells the other goblins. \"Four sennights and look—completely gone. No hero left. Just meat that knows what it's for.\"\n\nI cum from his words. Just a little one, a tremor that makes my pussy squirt once, adding to my puddle. \"Grak love Master,\" I moan into the dirt. \"Grak's smoothie needs Master's booyagh cock, please, PLEASE, this pet is so empty—\"\n\n\"Later,\" he says, as they start to play dice. \"Maybe.\"\n\nI stay there, face in the sand, ass in the air, pussy drooling, waiting for maybe. It's all I am now. A thing that waits for maybe.\n\nThe festival spins on around us—flesh and smoke and cum and sand—and I've never been happier because happiness is simple when you don't have thoughts anymore, just needs, and all my needs have one solution: Master's cock, Master's cum, Master's approval.\n\nI am Elise. I was never Aldric. Aldric was a dream this meat had before it learned what it was really for.\n\nThe sand tastes like goblin cum now.\n\nEverything does.",

He breathes deep—once, twice, three times.\n\nHe's not smelling the mare anymore.\n\nHeat blooms between my thighs. Unbidden. Sickening. I try EVERYTHING to stop it, biting hard down onto my lips. My nipples stiffen against the metal band. That scent I was enchanted to produce—green pear and jasmine and something deeper, muskier—\n\nJarkrond’s upper lip curls back in a slow, grotesque flehmen grimace, exposing slick pink gums and yellowed teeth as he tastes the pheromones on the air. A low, tectonic rumble vibrates through his barrel chest.\n\nElara is staring at me. At Jarkrond. At the massive equine shaft pointing in my direction.\n\n\"Al- Elise?\" Her voice is very small. \"Why is he looking at you like that?\"\n\nI don't have an answer.\n\nI don't have anything but the heat pooling in my belly and the collar humming against my throat and the terrible certainty that this is only the beginning.[Choice: You're exhausted...",

Her eyes find mine.\n\n*I'm sorry*, I try to say with my gaze. *I'm so sorry you're here. I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you from this.*\n\nShe squares her shoulders. Lifts her chin. And begins to undress.\n\nThe cloak falls first. Beneath it, her traveling clothes: a white linen blouse gone grey with road-dust, brown riding breeches that cling to her legs, tall boots caked with desert sand.\n\nShe looks at me. Holds my gaze.\n\nMy fingers find the clasps of my scale-mail top. The metal is warm from my body heat, slick with sweat. I fumble with the mechanism at my back.\n\nIt doesn't release.\n\n\"El—\" I catch myself. \"The clasp. Can you—\"\n\nShe's at my side instantly. Her fingers—cool, capable, *human*—work at the metal.

The band *tightens* instead of loosening, cinching around my ribs until I gasp. \"What in Flux's name—\"\n\n\"The armor.\" My voice comes out strained. \"It... it has a will of its own sometimes.\"\n\nShe pulls again. The metal band constricts further—and then, with a cruel flourish, it simply *releases*. The front falls away without warning.\n\nMy breasts spill free.\n\nThe sound they make is *obscene*. Heavy. Wet. FLOP-SLOSH. Twin masses of pale flesh dropping and bouncing, the momentum carrying them in opposing arcs before they settle into their natural hang—massive, pendulous, capped with nipples that have stiffened in the cool air without my permission.\n\nElara makes a sound.\n\nA sound. The sound a body makes before the mind catches up.\n\n\"Oh—\" Her voice cracks. \"Oh, *Aldric*—\"\n\n\"Don't. Please.\"\n\n\"They're so—\" She can't finish. Her hand rises, then falls. Rises again.\n\n\"I told ye, missus.\" Snib's voice cuts through the moment like a rusty blade. \"Yer wifey's got the best TITS in yer humie-town now!\"\n\n[Image: 'Oh, *Aldric*—'\n\"Shut UP!\" Elara screams at him. But her eyes haven't left my chest.\n\nI force myself to keep undressing. The bottoms come away more easily. A single clasp at my hip and the metal falls away, leaving only the thong underneath. That cursed strip of metal that's been sawing between my asscheeks for hours of riding.\n\nI hook my thumbs under the waistband. Hesitate.\n\n\"Together,\" Elara whispers. She's working at her own buttons now, fingers trembling on the laces of her blouse.\n\nShe pulls her blouse over her head.\n\nHer breasts are perfect handfuls, pale and freckled, tipped with nipples the color of summer roses. Her waist curves inward with natural grace.\n\n\"Beautiful,\" I breathe before I can stop myself.\n\nHer eyes glisten.\n\nShe pulls down her riding breeches. Steps out of them. Her smallclothes follow—modest white cotton, the kind she wears at home. I watch the fabric slide down her hips, revealing the neat triangle of auburn curls between her thighs, the gentle curve of her mound, the innocence of a body that belongs to *me*.\n\n*Mine*, something growls in my chest. A remnant of Aldric. *She's MINE. And that creature is looking at her.*\n\nI glance at Snib. His yellow eyes are fixed on Elara's ass—that perfect heart-shaped peach of flesh that I've cupped a thousand times, kissed, bitten, *spanked*. His cock has escaped his loincloth entirely now. Twelve inches of purple-veined meat, drooling precum onto his fur pile.\n\n\"Nice ARSE on the missus!\" he comments cheerfully. \"Not as big as YOURS, hero-cunt, but the SHAPE—\"\n\n\"Don't look at her.\" The collar tightens—a warning—but I don't care. \"Don't you DARE look at her.\"\n\nSnib's grin shows every broken tooth.\n\n\"Make me, titcow.\"[Choice: Pull down your thong.",

Where Snib's musk has seeped into my pores.\n\n\"Here.\" I lower myself first, the straw crackling beneath me. My tits sway with the motion, settling against my chest in ways that still feel *wrong*. \"It's not... it's nothing like home, but—\"\n\n\"It's with you.\" Elara follows me down. Her skin is cool against my fever-warmth. \"That's all that matters.\"\n\nWe arrange ourselves in the narrow space—barely enough room for two grown women to lie side by side. I pull her close, spooning against her back the way I used to do as Aldric. But everything is different now. My breasts press against her shoulder blades, soft flesh spreading and conforming to her contours. My arm, draped over her waist, brushes the underside of her breast—and I feel the difference keenly.\n\n\"You're so warm,\" she whispers.\n\n\"Yes.\" I press my lips to her hair.\n\n\"And you smell...\" She trails off.\n\nI know what she's smelling. The scent the collar makes me produce. The scent designed to drive goblin males wild.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Don't be.\" She takes my hand, brings it to her lips. \"It's still you. Under everything, it's still you.\"]She takes my hand. Guides me across the packed-earth floor—three steps, four, her bare feet silent - to the pile of straw that serves as my bed.\n\n\"Lie down,\" she says. Her voice has that healer's calm, the one she uses with frightened patients. \"Let me hold you.\"\n\nI lower myself into the straw. It crackles beneath me, sharp stalks poking at my bare skin, nothing like the cotton sheets of our bed at home. My tits settle against the rough material, the sensation making me wince.\n\nShe follows. Curls around me from behind, her arm draping over my waist. Her breasts press against my back—modest, warm, *human*. Her hips fit against my ass like they were made for this position.\n\nBut I'm so much *bigger* now. My hip flares out beyond hers. My ass, even lying on its side, is a hill she has to accommodate. When she reaches around to hold me, her hand brushes the underside of my breast—and I feel her hesitate.\n\n\"They're so heavy,\" she murmurs. Not accusation. Just... observation.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Does it hurt? Carrying them?\"\n\n\"My back aches. The armor...\" I trail off. \"They force my posture into something that can support the weight.\"\n\nShe's quiet for a moment. Her fingers trace patterns on my belly—that soft, delicate surface, so different from the hard abs I used to have.\n\n\"You're beautiful,\" she says finally.\n\nI choke on a laugh that turns into a sob. \"I'm *disgusting*. I'm built like a—\"\n\n\"Shh.\" She kisses the back of my neck. \"You're my husband.\"\n\nOutside, a sound rises from the lean-to. A wet, rhythmic SLAP-SLAP-SLAP that makes my stomach clench.\n\nElara goes rigid against me.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\nI know what it is. The sound of Jarkrond taking what he wants.\n\n\"The horses,\" I say carefully. \"The stallion, he... Clover was in heat. He's—\"\n\nThe mare screams. something beyond pain. Almost ecstasy.\n\n\"Oh gods.\" Elara's voice is small. \"Is he—\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"She was so scared of him when we arrived,\" Elara whispers.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Now she sounds like she's...\"\n\nShe doesn't finish.\n\nWe lie there in the dark, two naked women in a goblin's hut, listening to a mare being bred into submission. Snib's wet snores provide counterpoint from across the room.\n\n\"Aldric?\" Elara's voice is barely audible.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Do you want me to call you that? Or...\" She hesitates. \"Or Elise?\"\n\nThe question cuts deeper than any blade.\n\nI think of the collar around my throat. The name it whispered to Snib.\n\n\"El-Elise,\" I manage. \"It's... it's easier. For now.\"\n\n\"I don't care what body you're in.\" Her voice cracks but doesn't break. \"I don't care what that collar makes you wear or what sounds you make or what shape your flesh takes. You're *mine*. You've been mine since you bled on my roses and I stitched you back together. And I am NOT letting some three-foot goblin take that away.\"\n\nTears slide down my cheeks and into the straw.\n\n\"I love you,\" I whisper.\n\n\"I know.\" She presses closer. Her body heat seeps into my back, familiar despite everything. \"Now sleep. We're going to need our strength.\"\n\nI close my eyes. Try to ignore the sounds from outside, Clover's whinny dissolving into something that sounds almost like a moan.\n\nI cling to Elara. Cling to what's left of myself.",

The quick, competent movements of a woman who's spent years preparing meals for a household. The way she's already claimed this cookfire as *hers*, organizing the space around it, finding efficiency in chaos.\n\nShe's good at this. Taking control of environments. Making order from disorder.\n\n\"I found some roots growing near the well. And I saved the livers—they're good for iron, you need—\" She catches herself. Swallows. \"You need to keep your strength up.\"\n\nThe meal, when it comes, is the best thing I've eaten since the transformation. Tender rabbit, herb-crusted and perfectly cooked, with roasted roots that are bitter but satisfying. Elara serves us both before taking her own portion, moving around the fire with the ease of long practice.\n\nI eat in the clothes my wife gave me, my feet flat on the ground, my body covered in soft cotton, and I try to ignore the way Snib's eyes keep drifting to Elara's chest.\n\n\"Good GRUB, missus!\" He tears into his portion with greasy fingers. \"Keep cookin' like THIS, and maybe I'll let hero-cunt wear clothes MORE often!\"\n\nElara's hand tightens on her bowl.\n\n\"How generous of you,\" she grinds out.[Choice: Evening approaches.",

As if designed to glisten.\n\nI drag the comb down Jarkrond's barrel, working the dust from his coat in long strokes. His hide is fever-warm beneath my touch, radiating heat like sun-baked stone. When I lean close to reach his withers, something *thick* fills my nostrils.\n\nIt's... salty. Grassy, but also deeper. Like copper left too long in summer rain.\n\nI jerk my head back.\n\n*Focus.

His nostrils flare, drawing in my scent, and something shifts in his expression.\n\nI think about Elara, sitting on Snib's lap. Her back straight, her jaw set, her eyes fixed on nothing while his hands roamed her body. The way she didn't look at me. The way she *chose* not to look at me.\n\n\"She's still in there,\" I say quietly. \"They're still... they just need time. Elara needs time, and she'll be alright.\"\n\nThe strange thing is—he *feels* like he's listening. Hearing the isolation beneath them.

One massive hoof scrapes the earth—a sound like grinding stone.\n\nAnd then he moves toward me.\n\nMy heart stutters. But his approach is slow. Deliberate. Slow. Ponderous. A mountain deciding to walk.\n\nHe stops beside the hay bale where I'm perched. His barrel chest is level with my shoulder. The heat radiating off his grey hide is immediate, enveloping—like standing too close to a forge.\n\nIs he... comforting me? No. That's ridiculous. He may be more intelligent than the average horse, but not THAT intelligent.\n\nI let out a breath I didn't know I was holding.\n\nHis muzzle slides lower. Past my shoulder. Down my arm.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I whisper. \"I can tell you miss Clover.\"\n\nThe heat of him is making my head swim. The air thickens with him. *Earthy*. Sun-warmed leather, copper, the green-salt of living things.\n\nIt coats the back of my throat with each breath. Settles into my brain like smoke.\n\nIt smells *natural...* like the horses I've been around my whole life. But then again, Aldric never got *lightheaded* from the smell of horses.

Still *searching*.\n\n\"Easy, boy.\" My voice comes out strange. \"Easy.\"\n\nHis nostrils flare against my thigh.\n\nAnd then he *inhales*.\n\nThe sound is *obscene*. A deep, wet SNUFF that seems to pull the air from my lungs along with whatever scent he's seeking. His barrel chest expands, his whole massive body *drinking* me in.\n\n*He's smelling—*\n\nNo.\n\n*No.*\n\nThrough the wool of my breeches. He's pressing his velvety muzzle against the junction of my legs and *breathing me in* like I'm the most intoxicating thing he's ever encountered. The heat of his breath soaks through fabric that suddenly feels far too thin.\n\nThe fog parts around one clear, cold thought:\n\n*He has pheromones too.*\n\nNot like Snib's. Different. Deeper. Something that bypasses my brain entirely and speaks directly to the animal that lives in my hindbrain—the creature that knows, on some instinctive level, that this is a *dominant male* investigating a *potential mate*.\n\nMy thighs are shaking.",

The heat in them drops my stomach through the floor.\n\nHe stamps. Once. The impact shudders through the lean-to's frame, makes dust rain from the rafters.\n\nThen he *advances*.\n\nNot the slow, ponderous approach from before. This is purposeful.

Stands over me, his barrel chest blocking out the light.\n\nAnd then, very deliberately, he drops his head and *snorts* directly into my face.\n\nThe musk hits me like a slap.\n\nMy vision whites out. My thoughts scatter like frightened birds. I'm dimly aware of my hands catching myself against the ground, of my body swaying...\n\nWhen I can see again, Jarkrond is back at his post by the empty water trough. His tail swishes. His cock, I realize with horror, has dropped partially from its sheath-perhaps eight inches of mottled grey-pink meat, drizzling something clear onto the straw.\n\nHe looks at me over his shoulder.\n\n\"I'll...\" My voice is barely a whisper. \"I'll come back later.\"\n\nI crawl out of the lean-to on hands and knees.]Every muscle in my body begs to move—to run, to do *something*. But the fog in my head is too thick, his musk too heavy, and some animal part of me whispers that *movement means prey* and I am very, very small right now.\n\nJarkrond's muzzle *presses*.\n\nInsistent. The velvet of his nose parts my thighs wider, his hot breath soaking through wool until I can feel it on my *skin*.\n\nHe inhales again. *Deeper*.\n\nHis tongue emerges.\n\nThick. Grey-pink. *Wet*.\n\nIt drags up the seam of my breeches, from the crease of my thigh to the waistband, leaving a dark streak of saliva on the fabric. The sensation—rough and hot—makes my hips jerk involuntarily.\n\n*He's tasting me*, I realize through the fog. *Through my clothes.*\n\nAnother lick. This one centered directly over—\n\n*Oh gods.*\n\n—over the place where the wool has gone *dark* with something that isn't horse saliva.\n\nJarkrond makes a sound. Low. Satisfied.\n\nThen—finally—he pulls back.\n\nHis amber eyes meet mine. There's no grief in them anymore.\n\nJust *patience*.\n\n*He's marked me. Like he marked Clover.*\n\n\"I have to—\" My voice comes out wrecked. \"I have to go check the traps.\"\n\nI stand on legs that don't feel like mine. The wet patch on my breeches grows cold in the morning air.\n\nJarkrond watches me leave.\"Easy, boy.\"\n\nThe words come out too soft. But I can't find the strength for anything firmer—not with his musk coating my lungs, not with his heat seeping through my clothes, not with that heavy, sweet fog spreading through my limbs like honey through water.\n\n\"Easy. I'm not—I'm not going anywhere. Just... just give me some space, okay?\"\n\nHis ear swivels again.\n\n\"I know you miss her.\" I reach up—slowly, carefully—and lay my palm against his muzzle. The velvet gives beneath my fingers, warm and alive. \"I miss someone too. We're the same. You and me. Both of us... both of us lost.\"\n\nHe makes that low sound again. But different now.\n\nHis nose presses against my palm. Then slides *past* it—following my arm, my shoulder, the curve of my neck. Each inch of contact leaves heat in its wake, like brands pressed against my skin through cotton.\n\n\"That's it.\" My voice has gone dreamy. Distant. Like I'm listening to someone else speak. \"That's a good boy. We're friends, aren't we? We understand each other.\"\n\nHis muzzle reaches my jaw. His breath washes over my face—hot, green, *intoxicating*.\n\n\"Friends,\" I repeat. The word feels strange on my tongue. Wrong somehow.\n\nJarkrond's nostrils flare against my cheek.\n\nAnd then he *licks* me.\n\nHis tongue drags up the side of my face—rough and wet—from jaw to temple, leaving a thick trail of horse saliva in its wake. The sensation is so *unexpected* that I don't react at all, just sit there dumbly while he tastes me like I'm something to be *savored*.\n\nHe pulls back, and studies me with those amber eyes.\n\nLicks me again. Other side this time.\n\n\"Okay,\" I hear myself say. My voice is very far away. \"Okay. That's... that's fine. We're friends.\"\n\nHis tongue finds my ear.\n\n*Pushes inside*.\n\nThe sound I make isn't human.\n\nWhen he finally withdraws, my face is covered in his saliva, my ear is *ringing*, and there's a wet spot on the hay bale beneath me.\n\n\"Good boy,\" I whisper before scurrying away.\n\nHis cock has dropped fully from its sheath. Twenty-three inches of mottled flesh, drizzling clear fluid onto the straw.[Choice: Leave quickly!",

What RIGHT do I have to demand truth when I held so many secrets of my own?\n\n\"Try to sleep,\" I whisper.\n\n\"You too.\"]I slip away from the straw pile.\n\nMy knees find the packed earth beside the cold fire pit.

She's awake. Listening.\n\n\"Through Verge's door...\" I try to remember the rest. The prayers I learned as a child, the invocations Aldric spoke before battle. They slip away like water through fingers.\n\nThe collar *throbs*.\n\n*Storak*, something whispers in the dark. *Will spread the seed.*\n\nI squeeze my eyes shut.\n\nThe Ephemerals feel very far away tonight. Perhaps they've always been far away, and I was just too proud to notice.\n\nI crawl back to the straw pile. Settle beside Elara's clothed warmth without touching.\n\n\"You were praying,\" she says quietly.\n\n\"Trying to.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"So was I.\"\n\nHer hand finds mine in the darkness. Squeezes once.\n\nThen lets go.[Choice: Morning comes...",

Elara's back against my chest, the soft rise and fall of her breathing, the spill of autumn hair across our shared pillow of folded cloth.\n\nMy arm is draped over her waist.\n\nSometime in the night, my hand found its way beneath the thin linen of her nightgown—just *resting* against the soft plane of her belly. The intimacy of it aches. This is how we used to sleep.\n\nShe stirs.\n\n\"Mmm.\" Her voice is thick with sleep. \"Storm's over?\"\n\n\"Sounds like it.\"\n\nShe turns in my arms—carefully, slowly—until we're face to face. Those sapphire eyes blink open, still hazy with dreams. For one perfect moment, she just *looks* at me. At this face that isn't mine.\n\nThen she smiles.\n\n\"Good morning, love.\"\n\nMy heart cracks.\n\n\"Good morning.\"\n\nThe linen falls from one freckled shoulder, exposing the elegant line of her collarbone, the first hints of her modest breasts beneath.\n\n\"We should check the well,\" she says, already planning. \"And the food stores. Sand gets into *everything* during storms like that.\" Her nose wrinkles. \"Including places sand has no business being.\"\n\nFrom across the hut, the fur pile rustles.\n\n\"MORNIN', cunts!\"\n\nSnib rolls upright like something primordial surfacing from swamp-water. His loincloth has given up any pretense of coverage—one ball hangs fully exposed, crusted with something I don't want to identify. His cock, even soft, makes an obscene *slap* against his thigh as he stretches.\n\n\"That was a GOOD storm!\" He scratches his belly with obvious satisfaction. \"Nothin' like bein' trapped with two ripe females to make a gobbo feel *alive*.\"\n\nElara's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. But she doesn't snap at him. The collar has taught her that much, even though she isn't the one wearing it.\n\n\"I'll start the fire,\" she says instead, rising from our straw pile with fluid grace. Her bare feet pad across the packed earth. \"We'll need hot water to clean the sand from the grain.\"\n\n\"THAT'S the missus I like!\" Snib waddles toward the cold fire pit, his morning erection beginning its inexorable rise. \"Useful. Not like hero-cunt here, what just lies about lookin' pretty.\"\n\nI push myself upright. My breasts shift with the motion, heavy and unwanted, nipples stiffening in the cool morning air.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\nSnib's yellow eyes find mine. That grin spreads across his face like mold across bread.\n\n\"Oh, I got PLANS fer ye, titcow. Big plans. But FIRST—\" He turns to Elara, who's crouching by the fire pit, arranging kindling. \"—I want to have a CHAT with the missus.\"",

Yer wife's been pullin' her weight around here. Cookin'. Cleanin'. Keepin' things NICE.\" His warty hand lands on her shoulder. \"Seems only FAIR she gets a chance to earn some more coin off that debt of yers.

Almost friendly. \"About GOLD.\"\n\nShe doesn't turn around.\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\n\"Ye've been workin' HARD these past days. Keepin' the place nice.

APPRECIATION. Hundred gold. Just for lettin' me...\" He reaches up. His hand hovers inches from her chest. \"...show me GRATITUDE.\"\n\nEvery detail sears itself into my skull: the pulse jumping in Elara's throat. The way her hands have clenched in her lap. The fire in her sapphire eyes—not extinguished, just *banked*.\n\n\"Every gold piece,\" she says slowly, \"is a gold piece closer to going HOME.\"\n\nHer fingers find the first button of her nightgown.\n\n\"To rebuilding our *lives* in Eboncrest.\"\n\nThe button slips free.\n\n\"To our *garden*.

Smaller than the obscene masses strapped to my chest, but *perfect*—pale as cream with a scatter of copper freckles across the upper slopes, rose-pink nipples already stiffening in the cold morning air. The left one has a tiny mole just below the areola that I've kissed a thousand times.\n\nNow Snib's hands are on them.\n\nHe *GRABS* them—green fingers sinking into soft flesh until it *bulges* between his knuckles, claws dimpling skin. Elara's breath catches. Her eyes meet mine across the hut, and something *breaks*.\n\nSome wall she'd built between us.\n\n\"LOOKIT THESE!\" Snib cackles, bouncing her tits in his palms like he's weighing produce at market. \"Not as big as yer wifey's udders, but these got CLASS!

Suddenly, I'm reminded of Jarkrond, and...\n\n\"...done!\"\n\nHe steps back. Wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\nElara's breasts are *red* now—angry handprints marking where he gripped, her nipples swollen and glistening with his saliva. She's trembling. But she doesn't cover herself.\n\nShe just looks at me.\n\n\"A hundred gold,\" she whispers. \"Closer to freedom.\"\n\nThe collar purrs against my throat.*She's making her own choice. Like I made mine.*\n\nElara's fingers find the fourth button. The fifth. The nightgown parts, revealing the valley between her breasts, the gentle swell of flesh on either side.\n\nShe shrugs the fabric off her shoulders.\n\nHer breasts catch the morning light—pale as cream, freckled across the upper slopes, rose-pink nipples already stiffening. The left one has that tiny mole I've kissed a thousand times. They rise and fall with her breathing, which is getting faster despite herself.\n\nSnib makes a sound. *Hungry*.\n\n\"Now THAT'S what I'm talkin' about.\" He steps closer. His head is level with her chest. \"Hold still, missus. Gonna give ye the PROPER Snibby treatment.\"\n\nHis hands rise. Hover. Then *descend*.\n\nHe doesn't grab—he *cups*. Warty palms pressing against the underside of her breasts, lifting them, *weighing* them with almost clinical interest. His thumbs trace slow circles around her areolas, never quite touching the hardening peaks.\n\nElara's breath catches. Her eyes find mine.\n\nI force myself to hold her gaze.\n\n\"So soft,\" Snib murmurs. His touch is *gentle*—that's the worst part. Not brutal. Not violent. Just... *thorough*.\n\nHis thumbs brush her nipples.\n\nElara *gasps*.\n\n[Video]\n\n\"Body knows what it WANTS, don't it?\" Snib grins up at her.\n\nHe begins rolling her nipples between thumb and forefinger. Slowly. *Deliberately*. Watching her face as he works.\n\n\"Fifty gold,\" Elara whispers. Her voice is strained. \"For the garden fence.\"\n\nShe's counting down.\n\nROLL. TWIST. PINCH.\n\nHis tongue emerges. Laves across her right nipple in one long, wet stroke.\n\n\"Ten.\"\n\nHe pulls back. Her breast *bounces* slightly from the release.\n\n\"Done.\"\n\nElara sits there, nightgown pooled around her waist, her breasts red and wet with goblin saliva. Her nipples are *swollen*—angrier than I've ever seen them. She's trembling.\n\nBut she meets my eyes.\n\n\"A hundred gold,\" she says. \"For home.\"]I can't watch this. Can't see my wife—\n\nThe SOUNDS find me anyway.\n\nThe soft *rustle* of fabric parting. Buttons clicking against each other as they're undone.\n\nElara's sharp intake of breath.\n\nAnd then—\n\nSQUELCH.\n\nThe wet, *meaty* sound of warty palms closing around flesh. I know what that sounds like now. I've felt those hands on my own obscene chest enough times to recognize it.\n\n\"THRACK yes, missus.\" Snib's voice is thick with something I don't want to name. \"Look at these pretty pink POINTS. Hard as nubbies already. Yer body KNOWS what's good fer it.\"\n\nI hear Elara swallow.\n\nSQUEEZE. TWIST. A whimper that Elara immediately swallows. PINCH. Harder this time—I can tell by the sound she makes. Not quite a moan. Not quite a cry.\n\nSCHLURP.\n\n*He's licking them.*\n\nI can HEAR it. The soft *pop* as he sucks a nipple into his mouth and releases it.\n\n\"Done. DONE,\" Elara gasps.\n\nSilence.\n\nThen Snib's cackle, wet and triumphant.\n\n\"THERE'S a good girl. Every nipple-tweak is a GOLD PIECE, missus! Every LICK is a coin in yer pocket!\"\n\nI open my eyes.\n\nElara is pulling her nightgown back over her shoulders, fingers trembling on buttons that aren't there anymore—Snib must have torn them off. Her breasts are *red*. Angry handprints and a glistening trail of saliva marking where he touched her, where he TASTED her.\n\nShe doesn't look at me.\n\n\"Hundred gold,\" she whispers to no one. \"For us.\"\n\nThe collar hums against my throat, *disappointed* that I didn't watch.\n\nSnib adjusts his loincloth—the tent has grown SIGNIFICANTLY. I can see the *shape* of that cock through the fabric now, the way it *pulses* and throbs.\n\n\"Right THEN!\" He waddles toward the door, leaving Elara still sitting there, exposed, trembling. \"Storm's cleared. Time for CHORES. Hero-cunt—\" He points at me. \"—the well's probably CLOGGED after that blow. Go clear it out. Might take ye a WHILE, heh.\"\n\nHe looks back at Elara.\n\nHis grin shows every scraggly tooth.\n\n\"Me and the missus got more NEGOTIATIONS to discuss.\"\n\nThe hide-flap falls closed behind him.\n\n[Image: 'Go.'\n\n\"Go,\" Elara says finally as she re-buttons.

His hips are moving, small thrusts that push his cock through her grip. \"Feel them BALLS tightenin'?

Snib's balls are drawing up tight against his body.\n\nHer strokes speed up. Both hands working in tandem, one following the other, creating a continuous tunnel of slick friction. The precum is so thick now it's forming ROPES between her fingers when she adjusts her grip—stretching, refusing to break, finally SNAPPING with wet little *plap* sounds.\n\n\"Three fifty—\" She's counting down the gold pieces like a ledger, making it TRANSACTIONAL while his cock THROBS against her palms. \"—three hundred—\"\n\n\"HNNNNGH—FUCK—\" His hips are thrusting now, small jerks that push his meat through her grip. \"—ye got TALENTED hands, fire-cunt!

Soaked through my smallclothes, the cotton plastered to flesh that SHOULDN'T be this responsive. My nipples are so hard they HURT against my blouse. The collar hums against my throat—not tight, just...

Please... please let me make you cum.\"\n\n\"THERE'S me good girl! HRRRRNGH—!\"\n\nHis balls CLENCH visibly. The shaft SWELLS in her hands—she actually GASPS as it gets THICKER, stretching her grip wider. The veins BULGE like they're about to burst.\n\nI should close my eyes.\n\nInstead my hand is already moving—sliding down my belly, past the waistband of my breeches, finding—\n\nI'm pressed against the wall, peering through the gap, watching my wife stroke a goblin's cock while my own hand—\n\n*NO!*[Minigame]]My legs give out before my brain processes the decision. I'm sliding down the exterior wall, the rough mud-brick scraping against my shoulder blades, massive tits DRAGGING down the surface until my ass hits sand and I'm crumpled against the hut like something discarded. My palms clamp over my ears hard enough to hurt—\n\n*SCHLICK.*\n\nThe first wet sound punches through my palms like they're not even there. Meaty. Rhythmic. A sound I KNOW even though I've never heard it from this angle, from OUTSIDE, from the position of someone who should be IN there stopping it—\n\nI press my hands HARDER against my ears. It doesn't help.\n\n\"—GRIP it PROPER—\" Snib's voice, muffled but distinct. \"—don't just POKE at it like yer SCARED—\"\n\nA sharp intake of breath. Elara. That's ELARA making that sound, that startled little gasp that I know so well—but it's DIFFERENT now. There's something underneath it.\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK.*\n\nFaster now. Finding a rhythm.\n\nMy nipples have gone RIGID. My nipples snap rigid—iron-hard, drilling against cotton. Each heave of breath scrapes them raw.\n\nI'm breathing too fast.\n\n*Clink.*\n\nWhat was that?\n\n\"There we GO!\" Snib's voice filters through my useless hands. \"Look at them pretty white fingers on me POLE!\"\n\nI bite down on my lower lip so hard I taste blood. My thighs are pressing together of their own accord, the muscles in my inner legs tensing, and the pressure is WRONG because it doesn't help, it makes everything WORSE. The seam of my breeches is riding up between my legs, pressing against—\n\n*GLORP.*\n\nThat's not—that can't be—\n\n\"—NATURAL talent—\" The words come through in fragments. \"—bet ye've been THINKIN' about—\"\n\nA wet SNAP. Like something stretching and breaking. Like strings of something thick connecting and disconnecting. My mind supplies images I don't want and my cunt CLENCHES so hard my hips jerk involuntarily.\n\n\"—LOOK at me while ye—\"\n\nI'm hyperventilating. Each ragged breath makes my tits rise and fall like bellows, makes the hard points of my nipples drag AGONIZINGLY against the inside of my attire, makes my whole body flush with heat that has nothing to do with the desert afternoon.\n\n*GLORP-SCHLICK-GLORP.*\n\n\"—that's it—\" Snib's voice has thickened. \"—feel them BALLS—HNNNK—tightenin'—\"\n\nSomething escapes my throat. A tiny whimper, that I cut off immediately by biting my arm through my blouse. But I felt it—that involuntary response, my body making sounds of its OWN as it listens to—\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK—*\n\nFaster. The rhythm is unmistakable now. The wet sounds layer over each other: a continuous slick friction punctuated by guttural grunts and—\n\n\"—just FINISH already—\"\n\nElara's voice. But it's STRANGE. Breathy.\n\n\"—BEG me—\"\n\nSilence. Heavy. I realize I'm holding my breath, my whole body frozen, nipples ACHING, cunt literally THROBBING against the seam of my breeches, and I'm straining to hear—\n\n\"...please.\"\n\nThe word barely reaches me. Whispered. Broken.\n\n\"Please... finish.\"\n\nMy hand is moving. I don't tell it to. It's just SLIDING down my belly, my fingers trembling, finding the waistband of my breeches—\n\n\"Please finish... Master Snib.\"[Minigame]]",

Absolutely soaked—my smallclothes plastered to flesh that shouldn't BE this responsive, this desperate, this fucking NEEDY. The first brush of my fingertips against swollen folds makes my knees buckle, makes me catch myself against the wall with my free hand while the other—\n\n*Oh GODS—*\n\nInside, Snib's grunting has reached a fever pitch.\n\n\"HRRRNGH—GONNA MARK YE—HNNNNK—GONNA PAINT—!\"\n\nMy fingers circle the nub that now sends lightning up my spine with every touch. I'm biting my lip hard, trying not to make a sound, trying not to let them KNOW—but Snib knows, doesn't he? He KNEW I was watching. He knows I'm out here with my hand down my pants like some common brothel-crawler—\n\n\"TAKE IT!\"\n\nThe first rope ARCS from his cock.\n\nThick as my finger, heavy with weight, arcing through the torchlit air like a thrown rope of cream. It SPLATS across Elara's blouse with enough force to make a SOUND—*THWAP*—and immediately begins oozing down the fabric.\n\n\"HRRRRRGH—THRAK—!\"\n\nHe's screaming something nonsensical in Goblish now, his whole body shaking on the crate. His cock FLEXES in her grip and another rope FIRES—this one catching her across the throat, draping over her collar like some obscene necklace. The smell hits me even through the wall—RANCID and THICK.\n\nMy fingers move FASTER.\n\n\"GNNNNAAAHH—!\" A sound tears from my throat—quiet, muffled against my forearm, but THERE.\n\n\"MORE—HNNNNK—TAKE MORE—!\"\n\nA rope catches her across the cheek.\n\nI cum at the same moment. Faster than I ever have in my life.\n\nMy whole body CONVULSES—pleasure and shame and HORROR tangling together into something soul crushing. My cunt SPASMS while my fingers keep working that swollen pearl, while I watch rope after ROPE of goblin seed splash across my wife's face, her throat, her chest—\n\n\"HNNNNNNGH—LAST ONE—HRRRRRRRK—!\"\n\nThe final rope is the THICKEST. It fires directly at her face and she FLINCHES but not fast enough—it catches her across the lips, across her nose, draping over her features like some horrible mask of cream.\n\nI muffle my cry against my forearm. My legs are shaking. My fingers are SLICK when I pull them free.\n\nThe collar PURRS against my throat.\n\n*Good girl*, it seems to say. *Now you understand.*\n\nInside, Elara is wiping cum from her eyes, trying to blink through the mess. Her blouse is RUINED—soaked through in patches, the fabric clinging to her modest breasts beneath. Her hands glisten with his seed and her own stroking-slick.\n\n\"Five hundred gold off the debt!\" Snib announces cheerfully, tucking his softening cock back into his loincloth. \"See, easy!\"\n\nShe doesn't know I watched.\n\nShe doesn't know I came.\n\nBut I know.\n\nAnd I'll carry that knowledge like a stone in my chest for the rest of my days.\n]My hands ball into fists at my sides.\n\n*No.* I will NOT give in to this. Will not PLEASURE myself while—\n\nBut I can't look away either. Can't close my eyes. Can't do anything but WATCH.\n\n\"HRRRNGH—GONNA NUT—HNNNNK—GONNA FUCKIN' NUT ALL OVER YE—!\"\n\nSnib's whole body is SHAKING on that crate. His cock SWELLS in Elara's grip—visibly THICKENING, the veins BULGING like they're about to burst. His balls have drawn up so tight they're almost inside him.\n\n\"Just—HNNNGH—just DO it—!\" Elara's voice is desperate, her strokes FRANTIC now.\n\n\"BEG ME AGAIN!\"\n\n\"Please cum please cum PLEASE—!\"\n\n\"HRRRRRRRRRGH—!\"\n\nThick as my finger. HEAVY with weight. It arcs through the torchlit air like a thrown rope of cream and SPLATS across her blouse with enough force to make a wet *THWAP* sound. The fabric darkens immediately, clinging to the skin beneath.\n\n\"YELLAH-THRAK—TAKE IT—!\"\n\nMore. More more MORE. Each rope HEAVY and ROPEY, fired from that purple slit like he's PISSING seed. They catch her across the throat—*SPLAT*—her collarbone—*THWAP*—the hollow between her modest breasts—*GLORP*.\n\nThe heat between my thighs is UNBEARABLE now. I'm clenching my fists so hard my nails draw blood from my palms. My nipples ache against my blouse. Every nerve in this cursed body is SCREAMING for release—\n\nAnd I deny it.\n\n\"HRRRRRRGH—LAST—HNNNNK—LAST ONE—!\"\n\nThe final rope is different. THICKER. It emerges from his slit slow at first, a GLOB that hangs there, trembling—then FIRES with a wet *GLORRRRP*, catching her directly across the lips.\n\nElara SPUTTERS. GAGS. The cum is so thick it clings to her mouth like glue, and when she tries to spit it out, it just STRETCHES, forming a bridge between her lips and the floor that refuses to break.\n\n\"FIVE HUNDRED GOLD!\" Snib crows, releasing her hair. \"Fair and SQUARE, missus! Same time tomorrow, maybe we negotiate what that MOUTH can do! HRUK-HRUK-HRUK!\"\n\nI stayed. I watched EVERYTHING.\n\nAnd even as I resist, even as I ENDURE, some part of me knows the truth:\n\nThe arousal hasn't faded. It's just coiling TIGHTER, waiting for release I won't give it.][The word—that word, \"Master,\" in my wife's voice—my hand plunges beneath wool and cotton and finds RUIN.\n\nMy smallclothes are DRENCHED. Not damp. Not wet. Absolutely fucking SATURATED, the thin cotton plastered to swollen flesh like a second skin, and when my fingertips brush against the soaked fabric my whole body JERKS like I’ve touched red-hot iron.\n\nI bite my arm HARD to kill the sound that wants to escape.\n\nFrom inside: \"THERE it is! HRUK-HRUK-HRUK!\"\n\nThe laughing. The GLOATING. I should stop. Should remove my hand and stand up and walk away and—\n\nMy fingers push the smallclothes aside.\n\nThe first direct contact—fingertip to slick, swollen fold—makes my legs kick out involuntarily, my heels SCRAPING through sand. I'm so wet my fingers SLIP, skidding through the mess I've made, unable to find purchase on flesh that's gone butter-soft and fever-hot.\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK—*\n\nThe sounds from inside have resumed. Faster now. Building toward their natural conclusion. And I'm matching the rhythm without meaning to, my fingers finally finding that swollen pearl that right now is EVERYTHING—\n\n\"HRRRRGH—twist at the TOP—\"\n\nI'm circling it. Pressing. The pleasure is IMMEDIATE and CRUSHING, spreading out from that bundle of nerves through my belly, my chest, making my nipples strain even HARDER against my breast-band—\n\n\"—HRRRGH—that's the SWEET spot—\"\n\nA sound escapes me despite the arm clamped in my teeth. A wet little \"nnnngh\" that vibrates against my own skin. My hips are GRINDING now, pressing my cunt harder against my working fingers, the seam of my breeches tight across my ass, my massive tits heaving with each ragged breath.\n\n\"Oh GODS—\" Elara's voice, gagging. \"—that SMELL—\"\n\nI can smell it TOO. Filtering through the wall. Concentrated musk and something ROTTED and—gods help me—it's making me WETTER. My fingers slide lower, past the throbbing pearl, to the entrance that used to not exist, that's now practically GAPING open with need—\n\n\"—breeding musk—gets in yer HEAD—\"\n\nI push two fingers INSIDE.\n\nMy own fingers *sink* into my own cunt while I listen to my wife stroke a goblin's cock. The internal walls grip me like they're trying to pull them deeper. I'm so wet that the penetration makes SOUNDS—squelching, slurping, my own shameful noises layering with the ones filtering through the wall.\n\n\"—three hundred—HNNGH—two fifty—\"\n\nShe's COUNTING. Counting down gold while her hands work his shaft. And I'm fingering myself to the rhythm of the numbers, to the wet percussion of her strokes, to the building grunts of the creature who OWNS me—\n\nMy thumb finds my clit again and I START.\n\nStroking myself from the inside while my thumb circles the outside, my back arches off the wall, my tits pressing forward against my straining blouse, nipples so hard they feel like they're going to RIP through the fabric—\n\n\"—GETTIN' CLOSE, missus—\"\n\nI'm close too. Already. Too fast. The pressure is building at the base of my spine, in my belly, in my WOMB—\n\n\"—please—please cum—please let me make you cum—\"\n\nElara. Begging him to finish. And I'm—\n\n\"HRRRRRRRGH—!\"\n\nHis roar of release comes through the wall like a physical force. And something inside me CRESTS—\n\nMy orgasm EXPLODES.\n\nNot a gentle wave but a DETONATION. My cunt CLAMPS around my fingers so hard I can't move them, the walls spasming and SQUEEZING, and then I feel it—that PRESSURE—\n\nI SQUIRT.\n\nHot fluid GEYSERS around my trapped fingers, soaking through my smallclothes instantly, spreading across the crotch of my breeches in a dark wet stain that just keeps GROWING. My hips BUCK against my hand, my heels drumming the sand, my arm clamped so tight between my teeth I'm leaving bruises—\n\n\"—TAKE IT—TAKE MORE—\"\n\nHe's still cumming in there. I can hear the WET IMPACTS—*SPLAT-THWAP-GLORP*—his seed hitting flesh and fabric, painting my wife while I GUSH into my own pants—\n\n\"HNNNNNNGH—!\"\n\nThe sound tears from my throat, muffled but THERE. My whole body is SHAKING, another wave of orgasm crashing through me as I hear him grunt out his final ropes. More fluid escapes me—not as much as the first gush but enough, enough that my breeches are RUINED, enough that there's a dark puddle forming in the sand beneath me.\n\nI finally pull my fingers free with a wet SHLORP.\n\nThey're COATED. Glistening with my own shame in the afternoon light. I stare at them like they belong to someone else—these dainty, trembling fingers that just frigged me to a squirting orgasm while I listened to—\n\n\"FIVE HUNDRED GOLD!\"\n\nSnib's triumphant voice. The words that should mean something about the DEBT, about PROGRESS, but all I can think is:\n\nI came. I came listening to my wife jerk off a goblin. I came so hard I SQUIRTED through my clothes.\n\nThe collar hums against my throat. Warm. SATISFIED.\n\nMy hand is still wet with my own fluids. My breeches are soaked from crotch to mid-thigh. My nipples still ache against my breast-band, and deep inside me, aftershocks are still rolling through—little twitches of the muscles that just betrayed me.\n\n\"—same time tomorrow—\" Snib's voice, already planning the next violation. \"—maybe we negotiate what that MOUTH can do—\"\n\nI need to move. Need to compose myself. Need to—\n\nI can't. I just slump there, back against the wall, massive tits heaving, ruined breeches cooling against my skin, and I let the shame wash over me in waves.\n\nI'm supposed to be a hero.]My hand STOPS.\n\nRight there. Fingertips just inside the waistband, trembling, my body SCREAMING at me to keep going. But I don't.\n\nI WON'T.\n\nI yank my hand free like I've touched fire and CLAMP both fists against the ground, driving my knuckles into sand until it hurts. The pain helps. A little.\n\nFrom inside, the sounds are building toward something terrible.\n\n\"HRRRRRGH—FASTER—HNNNNK—!\"\n\nI can't see it but I can HEAR the wet acceleration—*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*—the rhythm becoming frantic, desperate. His grunts are layering over each other now, animalistic sounds that make my cunt THROB despite my locked-rigid fists.\n\nMy thighs press together so hard the muscles burn. The seam of my breeches is SAWING against my core with each involuntary shift, creating friction I don't want but can't stop. I'm SOAKED—I can feel it, the spreading wetness that's seeping through my smallclothes and into the wool of my pants, marking me as—\n\n\"—GONNA NUT—HNNNNK—GONNA FUCKIN' NUT—\"\n\nA sound tries to escape my throat. A whimper. I bite it back so hard my teeth meet through my lower lip.\n\nMy nipples are SCREAMING. Each heave of my chest makes them drag against cotton that feels like sandpaper now, oversensitive peaks that ACHE to be touched, to be pinched, to be—\n\n\"TAKE IT!\"\n\n*SPLAT.*\n\nThe sound of something heavy and wet hitting flesh. I KNOW what it is. Even without seeing, I know. My cunt CLENCHES so hard my hips jerk, and more fluid seeps through already-soaked fabric.\n\n\"HRRRRRGH—!\"\n\n*THWAP. GLORP. SPLAT.*\n\nMore impacts. WET. HEAVY. I'm imagining it despite myself—those ropes I've seen before, thick and yellowed and reeking, painting across—\n\nA tiny moan escapes me. Barely a sound, just a shudder of breath that carries with it all the arousal I'm refusing to acknowledge.\n\n\"—MORE—TAKE MORE—\"\n\n*GLORRRRP.*\n\nI'm going to DIE here. Die of frustrated arousal, curled against a wall, listening to my wife get—\n\n\"—LAST ONE—HRRRRRRRRK—\"\n\nA final, obscene sound of impact. Then heavy breathing. Panting.\n\nAnd silence.\n\nI'm SHAKING. My whole body trembling with denied release, with arousal that has nowhere to go. My cunt is THROBBING with each heartbeat, a persistent ACHE that won't fade. My nipples feel bruised from pressing against fabric. The wetness in my breeches has spread to the backs of my thighs.\n\nI didn't cum.\n\nBut my body is SCREAMING that I should have. NEEDED to. The unfulfilled tension coils in my belly like a spring wound too tight, waiting to explode at the slightest provocation.\n\n\"FIVE HUNDRED GOLD!\" Snib's voice, muffled but triumphant. \"Fair and SQUARE!\"\n\nI should feel something about that. About the debt decreasing. About progress toward freedom.\n\nAll I feel is EMPTY and FULL at the same time—empty of release, full of shameful need.\n\nI didn't touch myself.\n\nBut I wanted to. GODS, I wanted to. And I'll carry that knowledge next to the wetness in my clothes.][Choice: Compose yourself.",

The way she keeps shifting, straw rustling with each tiny movement. Her nightgown has ridden up slightly and I can see the pale curve of her calf in the dying firelight, the delicate bone of her ankle, and higher... the soft inside of her thigh where it presses against the other, rhythmically clenching and releasing like she's fighting something.\n\n\"Stop,\" she whispers suddenly.\n\nI freeze. \"Stop what?\"\n\n\"Stop...

She needs THIS.*\n\nI settle between her thighs and for a moment I just LOOK—her pussy glistening in the firelight, flushed pink and swollen, her clit a hard pearl peeking from its hood, everything open and exposed and DRIPPING—and she's trembling, her whole body vibrating with anticipation, and when my breath ghosts across her wet flesh she almost SCREAMS—\n\n\"Do it—fucking DO it—I can't—\"\n\nI flatten my tongue against her and LICK, one long slow stripe from her entrance to her clit, gathering the taste of her, and the sound she makes is this keening wail that echoes off the mud-brick walls—\n\n\"Oi!\"[Choice: No!",

Ye're gonna go sort out them bone-fuckers once and fer all.\" He doesn't even look up from his bowl as he says it, as if sending me to face a Sandwalker war band is no different than ordering me to empty his piss-pot. \"Can't have 'em leavin' their garbage on me doorstep. Bad fer the property value, innit?\"\n\nMy stomach drops through the floor—Sandwalkers don't leave skulls unless they mean to collect them, and a tribal band could be anywhere from ten to fifty warriors.\n\n\"Sn- master,\" I start, the title tasting like spoiled milk on my tongue, \"the Sandwalkers are dangerous even for a hero with full— I don't even have magic anymore.\"\n\n\"She would need the use of her magic restored.\" Elara's voice cuts through my objection. She's watching Snib with an expression I can't quite read, something between calculation and... acceptance?\n\nSnib's yellow eyes flick between us, his grin spreading like oil across water. \"Oh-ho! The missus wants her wife to have her sparkles back? Tell ye what—\" He sets down his bowl with deliberate slowness, then waddles over to where I'm standing. \"I'll let the collar give ye back yer magic, hero-cunt. But it's fer FIGHTIN' only, just while yer gone. Try ANY clever shit, and...\" His warty hand makes a squeezing motion at his own throat, and I feel the collar pulse in warning.\n\n\"Thank you, Master Snib,\" I force out, hating how quickly the gratitude comes now, how my body has learned to respond to his magnanimity.\n\nBut wait, did I just agree to-\n\nHe's not done. \"And since ye're representin' me territory, ye gotta look the part. No more of them modest humie clothes.\" His eyes gleam with fresh malice. \"Back to the proper outfit. The one that shows what ye really are.\"\n\nThe morning air is still cool enough to raise goosebumps across every exposed inch of skin as I strip away the relative dignity of blouse and breeches, my hands trembling as they work the clasps of that horrible armor, if armor it can even be called. Once again, the triangular scales leave the vast majority of my breasts to bounce and sway with every movement, the chains between them jingling like the bells on a fool's cap.\n\n\"Now ye LOOK like what ye are—a piece of fuckmeat that happens to swing a sword. Them Sandwalkers'll know exactly what kind of tribute ye're offerin' if the fightin' don't work out.\"\n\nElara makes a sound. When I look at her, she's studying the floor, her freckled cheeks flushed. \"You should take Whisperwind,\" she says quietly, still not meeting my eyes. \"And... Jarkrond. You'll need a mount if you're traveling.\"\n\nThe mention of the Ash-runner makes my thighs clench involuntarily. \"I can walk—\"\n\nElara's eyes flick to my spike-heeled boots, then away again. \"Don't be stupid. Take the horse.\"\n\nThere's something in her tone, something almost like she *wants* me gone, wants the distance between us, and I realize with a sick certainty that she's already thinking about what will happen while I'm away.\n\n\"Elara,\" I start, but she's already turning away, already dismissing me with the same casual efficiency she uses to organize herbs.\n\n\"Be careful,\" she says to the wall. \"The Sandwalkers respect strength, as I'm sure you remember. Show them any weakness and they'll—\" She stops, swallows. \"Just don't let them see you're afraid.\"\n\nSnib cackles at that, the sound wet and phlegmy. \"Oh, they're gonna see PLENTY, missus. A piece like hero-cunt showin' up in that outfit? Them bone-readers are gonna know EXACTLY what kind of diplomacy she's offerin'.\" He scratches his balls through his loincloth. \"Tell ye what, titcow—if ye can't beat 'em in a fight, just spread them thick thighs and let 'em pump ye full of desert-baby. Better than comin' back in pieces, innit?\"\n\nThe collar hums against my throat—not commanding, just *reminding* me that this is my reality now.\n\n\"Move that fat ass,\" Snib commands, already bored with the conversation. \"Want them bone-fuckers dealt with. And hero-cunt?\" He grins, showing every broken yellow tooth. \"If ye come back with sand-walker cum drippin' down them thunder-thighs, I'm chargin' ye extra fer the cleanup.\"\n\nI strap Whisperwind to my back—the weight familiar even if the blade itself radiates wrongness from what Snib did to it. Behind me, I hear Elara's sharp intake of breath, and Snib's satisfied chuckle.\n\nThe skull grins wider as I step over it, those empty sockets seeming to track my movement.",

Reading the fear-sweat already beading between my breasts, the nervous moisture gathering where the metal thong digs into my pussy lips. His ears snap forward.\n\nThat low chuff-sound rumbles from his chest.\n\n\"We're... going on a trip.\" I pitch my voice the way Aldric used to when commanding warhorses. \"Southwest. To the marshes.

The sensation makes my nipples instantly tighten against the scale triangles, and I hear the tiny *clink-clink* of the chains connecting them as my tits shift.\n\nFuck. There's no way I'll get him to take Clover's saddle. Snib never bothered with one—Ash-runners have backs too broad and temperaments too volatile. I'll have to ride him bareback.\n\n\"Okay,\" I mutter, more to myself than to him. \"Pack first. Then... mounting.\"\n\nI approach his left side where convention says you should always mount, though some deep instinct warns me that *convention* means fuck-all to a creature like this. My hands are still trembling as I try to secure the pack and waterskin to the leather straps that cross his barrel chest—straps that are clearly designed for this purpose but which require me to reach *under* his body, to duck beneath that massive ribcage where his scent is concentrated like a fog.\n\nEarthy and *male.* My head swims.",

This time it's just me and sixteen hands of temperamental stallion and the knowledge that if he decides to move, I'm dead.\n\nMy hands find his mane. Coarse grey hair, thick enough to grip. I take a breath, bend my knees, and spring upward—\n\nIn proper boots I could make this jump easily, but these spike-heeled monstrosities throw my balance off completely.

From this angle I'm eye-level with his back, which means I'm also eye-level with the curve of his spine, the powerful muscles shifting beneath grey hide, the raw animal *presence* of him.\n\nI grab his mane and swing my leg over—easier from here, thank the gods—and settle onto his broad back.\n\nThe moment my weight lands, he shifts. Just once. A deliberate rolling motion that makes me grab his mane and squeeze my thighs around his barrel, my exposed crotch pressing hard against his spine.\n\n*Oh.*\n\nThe ridge of his backbone fits *exactly* into the split of my thong, pressing up against my barely-covered pussy with a pressure that sends lightning through my hips.\"Down,\" I command, pointing at the ground.\n\nNothing.\n\n\"Please,\" I try, hating how quickly I change tone. \"I can't... these boots won't let me jump high enough.

He *chose* to make me ask.\n\nWithout a saddle, every contour of his body presses directly against mine. His spine forms a ridge that runs from his withers down toward his haunches, and I can feel it *perfectly* through the thin metal strip, the bone-line of him fitting into the cleft of my pussy like a key into a lock.\n\nMy thighs grip his barrel—they *have* to, there's nothing else to hold me in place—and the motion makes the inner flesh of my legs press against his short-haired hide, already warm from the morning sun. The width of him forces my hips apart in ways that make the thong dig deeper, that make every slight shift of my weight translate directly into pressure against places I don't want stimulated.\n\nI press my heels against his flanks.\n\n\"Okay,\" I breathe, gathering the reins. \"Southwest.

Karath-beasts. Sandwalkers have passed through here recently, leaving these dinosaur-like tracks in the packed earth around the spring.\n\nNot the Sandwalkers themselves, but their mounts. Their mounts that are far more obedient and loyal to their riders than mine.\n\nJarkrond's pace quickens when he scents the water, his trot becoming eager, and the acceleration turns my body into a percussion instrument again—*SLAP-wobble-SLAP-wobble* as my tits launch themselves into increasingly violent arcs.

It's starting to *curve*, developing the telltale arc of a stallion approaching full erection, and the precum is flowing freely.\n\n\"—that offensive THING!\"\n\nHis ears flick forward. He doesn't look threatened.]I plant both hands against his chest and SHOVE with everything I have.\n\nMy spike heels dig into the sand. My thighs strain. My ridiculous tits compress against his barrel chest, squeezed into even more obscene cleavage by the pressure, and I push and push and PUSH—\n\nHe doesn't move an inch.\n\nInstead, he takes a step FORWARD, and suddenly I'm stumbling backward, trying to keep my balance in these fucking heel-boots, my arms windmilling, my breasts flying in opposite directions—\n\nHis muzzle catches me. Right in the belly. Steadies me.\n\nAnd then, very deliberately, he drags his nose DOWN. Past my navel. Past the thin strip of metal thong. Until he's breathing HOT and WET directly against my pussy, the only thing between his nostrils and my cunt being a half-inch of scaled metal that's already damp with my own—with SWEAT.\n\n\"WHAT ARE YOU—\"\n\nHe *SNUFFS* again, and I feel the suction of his inhale through the metal, feel it shift and pull against my most sensitive flesh, and I hear myself make a sound that is NOT dignified and NOT heroic.\n\n\"Get your FACE out of my—\"\n\nHe steps back, leaving me wobbling, and presents his equipment as if to say: *You know what I want.*\n\nMy thighs are pressed together. Have been pressed together since he breathed on my—since he got too close. I'm pretending it's for balance.\n\n\"Fine,\" I say, my voice coming out hoarse. \"You want to play this game? I'll walk. I'll leave you here to rot in the sun with your—your—\" I gesture at his dripping equipment. \"—your *problem*.

Every second stretched like taffy as I lie here in the sand with sixteen hundred pounds of stallion standing over me, his legs forming a cage of grey muscle, his belly a ceiling of short-haired hide that rises and falls with each breath he takes.\n\nHis cock hangs directly above my face.\n\nI can't look away from it.\n\nThe shaft is *mottled*—patches of grey-pink flesh mapped with darker spots, the whole length of it glistening with some mixture of sweat and sheath-grease and that constant, *dripping* precum that just keeps *coming*. It's not fully hard yet, not the rigid pole I saw in the lean-to. This is something worse. Something *heavy*. It sways with his breathing, each inhale making it swing left, each exhale bringing it right, and the motion makes it *slap* wetly against its own underside with a meaty *THWAP* that seems to echo in the oasis silence.\n\n*THWAP.*\n\n*THWAP.*\n\nA strand of fluid detaches from his flared head and lands on my forehead. Warm. *Thick*. It doesn't run like water—it OOZES, creeping down toward my hairline with the consistency of warm honey.\n\n\"Get OFF me,\" I hiss, but my voice comes out breathy. My head is swimming.\n\nThe smell.\n\nThis close, with his sheath practically kissing the bridge of my nose, I'm drowning in something primal. Sweat and salt and that thick, gluey reek of stallion arousal, concentrated and *fermented*.\n\nI try to turn my head. His cock swings the same direction, tracking my movement, and now that bloated head is hovering over my cheek instead of my forehead. Another drip. This one lands on my earlobe, and I feel it slide down into the shell of my ear with obscene slowness.\n\n\"I SAID—\"\n\nHis balls shift.\n\nThey're hanging heavy in their wrinkled sack, each one the size of my fist, and as I watch—I shouldn't be watching, I should be FIGHTING—I see them *draw up* toward his body, then relax, then draw up again. Like they're *churning*. Like they're working overtime to produce more of whatever foulness is currently dripping onto my face.\n\n*DRIP.*\n\nRight on my lips this time.\n\nI clamp my mouth shut. The fluid sits there, warm and *sticky*, and I can taste it even without opening my lips—that salt-sweet-MUSK flavor seeping through my skin.\n\nHis cock twitches. The whole shaft *flexes*, going rigid for a moment, and I watch another three inches slide free from his sheath with a wet *schlorp*. Longer now. Thicker. That flared head is definitely *flaring*, the edges spreading wider, the cumslit gaping open like a hungry mouth.\n\nA thick rope of precum—a *rope*—emerges from that slit. It doesn't fall. It HANGS there, dangling, stretching lower and lower like some obscene stalactite of horse-slime, swaying with each movement of his massive body.\n\nLower.\n\nLower.[Minigame]]The word scrapes out of me like gravel through a sieve. \"Fine. FINE. You win. You HORRID, DISGUSTING—\"\n\nAnother rope of his stud-slop lands on my chin and my whole sentence dies in my throat.\n\nThe SMELL. Gods and Ephemerals, the *smell*. This close—nose practically wedged against the sweaty underside of that dangling horse-hose—I'm breathing nothing BUT him. Hot brass and fermented grass.\n\nMy head is *swimming*.\n\n\"I'll—\" I have to swallow before I can continue, and the motion makes some of his precum slide past my lips. Salt and slime and MUSK, thick as porridge. \"I'll *help* you. Once. Just to get us MOVING.\"\n\nJarkrond's response is to shift his weight, and his cock SWINGS—\n\n*THWAP-SLAP-wobble*—\n\n—right across my face.\n\nThe whole length of it. Eighteen? Twenty inches? I can't tell anymore because it's DRAGGING across my features, leaving a smear of that gluey horse-grease from my forehead to my chin, the sheer WEIGHT of it pressing my head sideways into the sand.\n\nHot. So *fucking* hot it feels like he's burning me.\n\nHis shaft is covered in this FILM—tacky as the skin on warm milk. Sheath-butter, my mind supplies helpfully. Smegma. Cock-cheese. All the filthy words for what happens when a stallion goes too long without—\n\nHe drags back the other way.\n\n*SCHLORP-SLAP*.\n\nI can barely SEE through the coating of horse-gunk, everything gone blurry and golden-grey, but I can FEEL every ridge and vein of that monstrous thing as it paints my face like I'm a canvas for stallion-slime.\n\n\"You fucking—\" I spit to the side. Stringy. His precum is so *thick* it clings to my lips in ropes. \"You're ENJOYING this!\"\n\nHis balls PULSE above my forehead, CLENCHING in their sack. And a fresh gout of that warm, sticky stud-spit erupts from his cumslit and lands DIRECTLY in my left eye.\n\nI shriek.\n\n\"ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! I'M MOVING!\"\n\n[Image: right]\nMy hands are shaking as I reach up—reach *up*, toward that dangling horror, toward the cock that's been teabagging my face for the last thirty seconds—and my fingers make contact with *heat*.\n\nIt feels like gripping a fever-hot iron wrapped in wet velvet.\n\nIt is terrifyingly *alive*. It THROBS under my touch, FLEXES against my palm. It's covered in this warm, slippery layer of who-knows-what that makes my grip slip and slide. The shaft is HEAVY. Heavier than it looks. When I try to wrap my fingers around it, I can't even get halfway—my thumb and middle finger are INCHES apart, and the flesh between them is *twitching*.\n\nHis cock LURCHES in my hands.\n\n\"Hold STILL—\"\n\nAnother rope of precum jets out and spatters across my exposed tits. I feel it drip down into my cleavage, warm and GLUEY, soaking into whatever's left of my dignity.\n\nHis flare is ENORMOUS up close. The head of his cock is the size of a fucking APPLE, the edges all ruffled and ridged, that massive cumslit gaping open like a toothless mouth. Grey-pink meat with darker speckles, the whole thing WET and SHINY and THROBBING in my hands.[Choice: Keep stroking.]",

Sand clings to my skin where his precum made it paste. My hands are shaking. \"RIGHT. Let's just... get this OVER with.\"\n\nJarkrond shifts, presenting his hindquarters like he's done this before—and maybe he HAS, I realize with horror, maybe Snib has had OTHERS do exactly this—and now I'm kneeling beside eighteen-plus inches of stallion prick that's bobbing gently in the desert air.\n\nMy fingers close around him again.\n\n[Image: *SQUELCH*\n\n*SQUELCH*.\n\nThe grease is warmer now.

Can't help it. \"Just—FINISH—you—ANIMAL—\"\n\nHis haunches CLENCH.\n\nI feel it before I see it—the FLEX in his shaft, the sudden SWELL of his balls drawing up tight, and then his cock LURCHES in my grip hard enough to nearly rip free—\n\nA finger-thick strand of pearly-grey stud-gunk ROCKETS from that gaping cumslit and SPLATS into the wet mud near the oasis edge, and I watch—jaw dropped, hands still wrapped around his spasming pole—as it COILS there like a dying serpent, so thick it barely spreads, just SITS there in a glistening heap while his cock rears back for another shot.\n\nThis one hits the palm tree. STICKS. Starts sliding down the bark in a viscous grey trail.\n\nJarkrond WHINNIES—high and sharp—and his whole hindquarters THRUST forward, fucking through my fists, and I have to SCRAMBLE to keep my grip as he starts RUTTING into empty air, his massive body shaking with each blast.[Image: right]\nEach one is THICK as my thumb, DENSE with whatever concentrated FUCK-GRAVY his balls have been brewing since Clover left, and the SMELL—\n\nIt's hitting me in WAVES now, each eruption releasing a fresh cloud of that stallion-MUSK that goes straight to whatever broken part of my brain is supposed to process SEX. My nipples are ACHING against the armor. My thighs are CLENCHED so tight my muscles burn. And between my legs, behind that thin strip of metal, I can feel myself getting—\n\nNO.\n\nI pump HARDER.\n\n\"GET IT OUT,\" I snarl through gritted teeth. \"ALL of it. EMPTY those disgusting HORSE-BALLS!\"\n\nThe mud near the water's edge is practically GLAZED now, his thick seed PUDDLING in the divots and actually starting to PILE UP where it's thickest—actual three-dimensional MOUNDS of horse-nut just SITTING there, too dense to sink, too viscous to spread.\n\nHis legs are shaking. His tail is FLAGGED straight up. And that monster in my hands is still PULSING, still FLEXING, still trying to breed something that isn't there—\n\nThis one comes out CHUNKY. Actual CLOTS now—dense packets of his stallion-cream, dense packets of concentrated sperm that PLOP onto the ground like someone dumped a fistful of day-old porridge.\n\nI can see his swimmers in it.\n\nNot REALLY—not with my eyes—but some primitive part of me KNOWS what's wriggling in those thick white masses, knows that each one of those gooey piles contains enough potent animal-seed to knock up a dozen mares, and the knowledge makes my stomach flip.\n\n*drool...*\n\nFinally—FINALLY—the jets are weakening. Still thick. Still ROPES. But smaller now, weaker, his cock going from LAUNCHING to DRIBBLING as the last of his load oozes out in syrupy strands that swing from his cumslit and drip-drip-drip onto the thoroughly defiled sand.\n\nJarkrond STAMPS once more. Blows air through his nostrils. And when he turns his head to look at me, *satisfaction* pools in those amber eyes like warm oil.\n\n\"There.\" My voice comes out hoarse.

Almost *friendly*.\n\n\"Don't you DARE act smug,\" I spit at him, climbing to my feet. My legs are shaking. From anger. From exertion. From absolutely nothing else. \"This was a ONE-TIME thing.

His cock *bobs*.\n\nI circle around to his flank, positioning myself where I can reach his equipment without being directly under him again. From this angle the full horror of his arousal is on display: that mottled shaft jutting from his distended sheath, easily eighteen inches now and still not fully rigid, thick as my forearm and *curved* with the weight of itself, the flared head gaping wide and drizzling a continuous strand of precum onto the sand.\n\nThe puddle beneath him has grown.

My tits are SWINGING with the motion—*SLAP-wobble-SLAP*—the chains between the scale-triangles jingle.\n\n\"Is THIS what you wanted?\" I'm growling up at him, my face contorted with outrage even as my hands keep working, keep PUMPING. \"Some big-titted fuck-doll to MILK you? Is THAT what—\"\n\nHis cock *FLEXES* in my grip in response.\n\nThe shaft goes rigid. Fully hard now, every vein standing out in stark relief, the flared head spreading WIDER until it's the size of my fist. His balls draw UP toward his body, the wrinkled sack going taut.\n\n\"Oh no. No no no—are you already—\"\n\nThe first rope doesn't spray. It *ERUPTS*.

My arms are BURNING but I can't stop now, can't leave him half-finished, the collar humming warm and *pleased* against my throat.\n\nThe second rope is bigger. LONGER.

His whole body SHUDDERS as I milk him, as I WRING his fat horse cock with both hands, my ridiculous curves bouncing and jiggling and SLOSHING with the effort.\n\nEach jet thicker than the last. Each one adding to the growing MOUND of stud-slop in the mud beside the oasis spring. The smell is CHOKING me now—that concentrated reek of horse cum, thick enough to taste without even opening my mouth, seeping into my pores, soaking into my HAIR from how close I am to ground zero.\n\nHis balls CLENCH.\n\nThe final rope is the worst. It shoots out, a solid stream that goes on for three full seconds, adding a last viscous coil to the pile before finally, FINALLY tapering off to a drizzle, then a drip, then nothing.\n\nI release his cock.\n\nIt SLAPS back against his belly, still half-hard, still dripping.\n\nI'm on my knees in the mud.

For the first time, I'm grateful for Jarkrond's broad back beneath me.\n\nor )\"Careful here,\" I murmur, my hand resting on his neck in a gesture that would have been impossible an hour ago. Something shifted between us at that oasis—something I don't want to examine too closely. His ear flicks back toward my voice, acknowledging, and he adjusts his path to avoid a particularly wet stretch of ground.\n\nWe understand each other now. I hate that we do.\"Don't get comfortable,\" I growl at him, though the warning is as much for myself as for him. \"That back there was a one-time display of your disgusting animal nature. It changes nothing.\"\n\nHe chuffs, and I feel the vibration of it through his whole body.\n\n*Whatever you say*, that sound seems to say. *Whatever you say.*\n\nThen the first standing water appears.\n\nPools that reflect the copper-stained sky like shattered mirrors, their surfaces so still they might be glass until a bubble of marsh-gas rises through them and *pops*, releasing a sulfurous belch that makes my eyes water.\n\nThe sand becomes mud. The mud becomes mire.\n\nAnd the smell changes.\n\nFirst comes vegetation—*green* things, after two days of nothing but dust and Snib's rotting musk. My lungs drink it in like wine. Then the rot arrives beneath it, sweet-sick and cloying, the perfume of things decomposing underwater where the sun can't find them. And underneath that, threading through everything like a promise of violence: something *animal*. Territorial.\n\nJarkrond's ears pin flat against his skull.\n\n\"I know,\" I tell him, because suddenly I do. The Sandwalkers who left that fox skull on Snib's doorstep didn't come from the Shifting Sands at all. I'd assumed desert tribe—the *Kheth-Suul*—but these tracks lead into swampland.\n\nThe *Kheth-Muur* - they're Marsh-Walkers.\n\nAldric fought alongside them once, years ago, against a band of river pirates who'd been raiding both human and Sandwalker settlements near Lowmarsh. He remembered their bone-crested hair. Their milk-white scars. The way they moved through water like ghosts made of leather and obsidian.\n\nHe also remembered their Bone-Seers.\n\n\"This just got significantly worse,\" I mutter.\n\nThe trees begin around the same time the ground loses any pretense of solidity. They're not trees anymore, not really—they're *corpses* of trees, drowned oaks and willows that died standing and never fell. Their bark has rotted away to reveal wood bleached bone-white by decades of submersion, and from every skeletal branch hangs the bone-moss.\n\nGrey and fibrous, trailing in curtains from the canopy, it sways in air that never quite becomes wind. When one strand brushes my shoulder, I flinch—it's *rough*, like dried sinew.\n\nJarkrond's pace slows. His head lowers. Every few steps he pauses to test the ground ahead with one hoof before committing his weight, and this proud beast—the one who demanded sexual tribute at the oasis—is *cautious* now.\n\nWhatever lives in these waters, Ash-runners are not its apex predator.\n\nThe canopy of dead branches and bone-moss filters everything to a greenish-grey that turns the world underwater-dim even at midday. Shadows don't fall where they should. Sometimes they *lead* instead of follow. Sometimes they move when nothing else does.\n\nAnd the sound—\n\nThe desert was *silent*. A held breath. A vacuum.\n\nThe marsh is *loud*.\n\nInsects drone in waves that rise and fall like breathing, cicadas screaming their presence to anything that might be listening. Birds call from somewhere in the bone-white canopy—strange sounds that might be warnings or might be lures. Water moves constantly: dripping, splashing, gurgling, the marsh digesting itself in real-time.\n\nAnd underneath it all, so low I feel it more than hear it: a *grumble*.\n\nLike distant thunder. Like a stomach growling. Like something very large shifting its weight in the dark water ahead.[Choice: Jarkrond stops.",

His ears swivel constantly, tracking sounds I can barely perceive.

To Snib's hut. To Elara's cooling warmth. To whatever fresh degradation awaits.\n\nBut it's still *home*, compared to this.\n\nJarkrond's head turns. Those amber eyes meet mine over his shoulder, and in them I see something I haven't seen from him before.\n\nHe starts walking again.]Every muscle in Jarkrond's body has gone tense, and when I squeeze my thighs to urge him forward—the pressure grinding that damned ridge of his spine against my pussy again—he doesn't move. His ears are pinned. His nostrils flare with each breath.\n\n\"Move,\" I command. \"We don't have time for—\"\n\nThat grumble comes again, closer now. Something *large* is moving in the water ahead. I can see the ripples spreading outward from a point I can't quite locate, disturbing the mirror-still surface.\n\nJarkrond stamps his hoof. Once. Twice.\n\n\"I know,\" I say through gritted teeth. \"But the collar won't let me turn back, so we go *through*. Understand? Through or nothing.\"\n\nHe doesn't understand. He's a horse—an intelligent horse, an *insufferable* horse, but still a horse. But he must hear something in my voice, or smell something in my fear-sweat, because after a long moment he begins to move again.\n\nTesting every step. His head swinging side to side like a serpent tasting the air.\n\nWe pass the first bone-markers twenty minutes into the true marsh.\n\nHuman skulls, mounted on stakes driven into the muck at the waterline. Their empty eye sockets face outward.\n\nIn Sandwalker culture, the honored dead watch over territorial boundaries. These skulls aren't threats. They're ancestors and guardians. Each one has a single rune carved into its forehead.\n\n\"We see you,\" I murmur to the nearest skull. \"We mean no harm.\"\n\nIts empty gaze offers no response.\n\nThe channels between drowned trees grow narrower as we press deeper. Some are wide enough for Jarkrond to wade through—the water never rises past his belly, though I lift my feet anyway, unwilling to let the black water touch my skin. Others force us to find paths along ridges of firmer ground that wind between pools like the spines of submerged serpents.\n\nJarkrond struggles.\n\n[Image: His hooves are made for sand, not sucking mud that tries to swallow him with every step.\n\nHis hooves are made for sand, not sucking mud that tries to swallow him with every step. Twice he stumbles, nearly going down, and I feel the massive muscles of his hindquarters *strain* to pull himself free of muck that doesn't want to let go. His proud bearing from the oasis has vanished entirely—now he moves with his head low, his ears constantly swiveling, his nostrils flared to catch every hint of danger.\n\nBut he keeps going.\n\nThe bone-chimes appear next.\n\nStrings of human femurs, ribs, finger-bones—hanging from dead branches across the approach channel. They're arranged to create an alarm system; *any* movement through this passage will make noise.\n\nThe Sandwalkers know when visitors approach.\n\n*Always*.[Choice: 'Hello?'",

They're burning *lotus*.\n\n\"Chieftain!\" the first warrior calls upward, toward a larger platform draped with bone-trophies. \"The green-filth sends tribute!\"\n\nA figure emerges from shadow.

I know that term—spirits that possess corpses in the deep marsh, animating them toward purposes no living thing understands.\n\n\"Unless,\" the chieftain continues, and now his eyes travel down my body with the same insulting slowness as his warrior's had, \"the green-filth has sent adequate *payment* for passage through territories that will soon be ours.\"\n\n\"What payment would—\"\n\n\"The only currency your kind understands.\" He gestures at my exposed flesh. \"Cunt.

The chieftain doesn't.\n\n\"Then the green-filth should have thought before it squatted where it doesn't belong. But perhaps...\" He steps closer. I smell the drake-leather of his wrap, see the bone-dust in his scars catch torchlight. \"Perhaps the fuck-doll herself wishes to pay the debt. One woman, serving thirty warriors for a moon's turning, might equal thirty women serving once.\"\n\nThe female drake-rider makes a sound of disgust. Says something in their tongue that makes several warriors chuckle.\n\n\"Vash'ti says you wouldn't survive three nights,\" the chieftain translates. \"That soft meat like yours splits too easy.

I'm—*\n\nHis hand FISTS in my hair, YANKS my head back, and suddenly I'm staring up at the smoke-hazed sky through tear-blurred eyes while his face looms over mine, upside-down, those amber predator-eyes drinking in my expression.\n\n\"What did he call you? Before you became *this*?\"\n\n\"E-Elise.\" The name scrapes out. Wrong. It's WRONG. \"My name is—\"\n\n\"Your NAME is what we decide it is.\" He releases my hair, and my head DROPS, chin hitting my own collarbone, and from this angle I can see straight down my own body—the pale canyon of my cleavage, the bare mound between my spread thighs—and past it, past ME, the chieftain is REMOVING HIS WRAP.\n\nThe lotus smoke coils thicker here, turning the air into syrup I have to SUCK into my lungs, each breath coating my throat with that sweet-rot taste that makes my nipples feel like someone's running invisible tongues over them. My head's already swimming—no, not swimming, *drowning*—and when the chieftain steps forward, his loincloth already discarded, I see his cock for the first time and my brain tries to process it through the lotus-fog: fourteen inches of sun-darkened meat mapped with veins thick as worms, the head angry-purple and already drooling this clear stuff that stretches from his piss-slit.\n\n\"HNNNH!\"\n\nStraddling his hips, my thighs forced so wide around that barrel torso that my hip joints ache. And his cock — gods, his COCK — I can feel his PULSE through it — slow, strong, the heartbeat of something too large for its container. The weight alone pins me — this thing is HEAVY, dense as a weapon, hot as a brand. My skin where it touches feels scalded.\n\nHis hands find my ass.\n\n*GRIP*.\n\n\"Nnnngh—!\" The sound escapes before I can stop it. His fingers *sink* in, calloused palms spreading my cheeks, and the position—the *vulnerability*—makes my heart hammer against my ribs.\n\n\"Such *gifts* you have.\" He's *kneading* me now, slow circular motions that make my ass-flesh squish and reshape around his fingers.\n\n\"AHHH-AHHH-*HNNNNGH*!\"\n\n\"A thumb.\" He's talking to the watching warriors now, not to me. \"Watch, brothers. Watch how the tribute-meat's body teaches her what she is.\"\n\nHe lines up his cock with my entrance and I can FEEL the heat radiating off it from inches away, like holding your hand near a forge, and when the head makes contact—\n\n*This is it. This is the moment Aldric truly dies and—*\n\nHe pushes.\n\nMy virgin pussy is tight as a fist despite all its drooling. His cockhead presses and my entrance resists — not like a door being opened but like a mouth being forced wider than it wants to go. I feel every millimeter of the stretch separately, each one a new ring of muscle surrendering, and the sensation is nothing I have reference for. When I had a cock, penetration was PUSHING. This is being OPENED. Being hollowed out from the center. The burn starts at the rim and radiates inward like ripples in reverse, and somewhere behind the burn is something worse — a deep, aching RIGHTNESS, like a socket finding its joint.\n\n\"NNNNGH—AHHHHH—OH-OH-OH—IT'S—GOING—IN—MMMMMPH—\"\n\n\"Listen to it sing,\" someone comments. \"The tribute-meat's cunt is greeting its first cock.\"[Choice: POP.",

Watch what happens when I—\"\n\nHe punches forward and his cockhead hits something DEEP — a barrier I didn't know I had, a tight ring of muscle at the very end of me. The impact sends a sensation I have no NAME for radiating through my pelvis — not pain, not pleasure, but some third thing that makes my vision go white and my womb CRAMP like a fist clenching around nothing. It's like being punched in the stomach from INSIDE. Like discovering a new organ by having it battered.\n\n\"GHHHAAAAAAA-WHAT—WHAT IS—AAAAH-AH-AH-AH-*AAAAAHHH*!\"\n\n\"She's already cumming.\" Disappointment? Amusement? \"Three strokes and the tribute-meat is painting my cock with her juice.\"\n\nHe's right. But it's nothing like cumming as a man — that was a spike, sharp and done. This is a TIDE. It starts in my toes and rises through my calves, my thighs, pooling in my pelvis where it DETONATES, and the detonation doesn't END, just keeps expanding, each wave stronger than the last. My pussy seizes around him — I can feel the individual muscles firing in sequence, ring after ring after ring from entrance to cervix, like a throat swallowing, squirt spraying around his shaft to splatter on the burlap while my whole body convulses like I'm being shocked by a magic spell, and through it all he just stays BURIED, letting me thrash on his cock while the warriors laugh and make their observations:\n\n\"Look at those milk-bags DANCE!\"\n\n\"She's flopping like a caught fish!\"\n\n\"The green-filth's whore is grateful for real cock!\"\n\nWhen my orgasm finally releases me, I flop back onto the soaked burlap, panting like I've run for miles, sweat pooling in the hollow of my throat, and the chieftain hasn't even started FUCKING me yet.\n\n\"Now,\" he says, pulling back until just his head remains inside, \"let me show you what the Kheth-Muur do to pretty tribute-meat who crawl into our territory begging to be bred.\"\n\nHe SLAMS forward.\n\nThe impact drives all the air from my lungs in a sound like: \"HOOOOOPH!\"\n\nThen he's fucking me. Really fucking me. Pure RUTTING—his hips jackhammering between my spread thighs with wet SLAP-SLAP-SLAP-SLAP sounds while his balls crack against my ass with meaty THWACK-THWACK-THWACKs.\n\n\"GHAH—GAH—GAH—GAH—UNNH—UNNH—FUCK—FUCK—FFFUUUU—\"\n\nWords dissolve into animal sounds as my brain tries to process the sensation of being OPENED, INVADED, CLAIMED, my pussy stretching and clenching and absolutely DROWNING his cock in juice that froths white with the friction of his thrusting, and every time he bottoms out—every time that purple mushroom head punches my cervix—lightning shoots through my womb and makes my tits bounce so hard they're slapping my own face.\n\nThe lotus smoke thickens, pouring into my gasping mouth, and suddenly everything comes into hyperfocus—Each ridge of his fingerprint sears where he grips my thighs—my pussy walls mapping every vein on his cock—my ass jiggling in waves from each impact—deep inside, my eggs RELEASING in answer to this breeding frenzy, and when he leans forward to bite my nipple—[Minigame]",

Every nerve ending is firing at once—I can feel individual drops of sweat rolling down the chieftain's chest to drip onto my belly, can feel the way his pubic bone is MASHING my clit flat with each impact, can feel my pussy walls rippling along his length like they're trying to milk him from root to tip—\n\n\"HNNNGH—GONNA—GONNA CUM—CUMMING—CUMMMMING!\"\n\n\"She announces it!\" The chieftain laughs, never breaking rhythm. \"Like a town crier! 'THE WHORE IS CUMMING!'\"\n\nAnd I am—my pussy CLAMPS so hard he has to FIGHT to keep thrusting, the muscles seizing around him while my whole body goes rigid as a battlefield corpse, back bowing off the platform until only my shoulders and ass are touching, creating this obscene arch that pushes my tits toward the smoke-hazed sky, and the SOUND I make—\n\n\"EEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHNNNNNNGGGGHHHHAAAAA!\"\n\n-it's the sound a soul makes when it's being fucked out through a cunt.\n\nThat's when he starts to swell.\n\nI FEEL it—his cock getting FATTER inside me, stretching walls that are already stretched to capacity, and his balls draw up from their steady slap-slap-slap against my ass to press TIGHT against his body, and his face contorts—rage and ecstasy fused into one animal mask—\n\n\"Take the planting, tribute-meat! Take what you came here for!\"\n\nThe first rope of cum hits my cervix like a crossbow bolt.\n\nHot—SCALDING hot—hot enough that I swear I can feel it COOKING my insides, and thick, so thick it doesn't shoot so much as SQUEEZE out of his cock in these massive pulses I can feel traveling up his shaft where it's buried in me—\n\n\"TAKING IT—TAKING YOUR CUM—FILLING ME—BREEDING ME—YESYESYES!\"\n\nThe words pour out of me without thought, without filter, while his seed pours INTO me, rope after rope of marsh-warrior cum that's probably swimming with enough potent sperm to knock up the entire female population of Eboncrest, and I can feel it POOLING in my womb, feel the weight of it settling in my belly like I've swallowed a cup of warm honey except it's in the WRONG hole, the hole that makes babies, the hole that used to not exist when I had a cock—\n\nHe pulls out.\n\nThe wet SQUELCH my pussy makes trying to hold onto him is obscene, and then there's this moment where my gaping hole is just OPEN to the air, twitching and grasping at nothing while his cum starts to GLORP out in thick white ropes that connect my pussy to the burlap for a second before breaking, and I'm still cumming, still shaking, when the next warrior drops between my legs.[Choice: This one doesn't speak. Just rams in.]His teeth close around my nipple and the world goes WHITE.\n\nFrom EVERYTHING—all at once. The lotus smoke saturating my lungs, the cock SLAMMING my deflowered pussy into submission, the sensation of being WATCHED by thirty warriors who see me as nothing but a collection of holes to fill—it all crashes together into a wave that threatens to sweep away everything I ever was.\n\n*Elara's face. Her autumn hair spilling across our pillow. The way she laughed when I—*\n\n\"HNNNNNNNNNGHHH-AH-AH-AH-FFFUCK—\"\n\nThe chieftain's hips SLAM forward one final time and I feel him swell inside me, feel his cock-head FLARE against my battered cervix like it's trying to pry its way into my womb, and then—\n\nThe first rope of his seed hits my cervix like a punch from the inside.\n\nHot. So fucking HOT. Like he's pissing lava directly into my baby-chamber, each pulse SCALDING my walls, painting my insides with thick tribal cum that I can actually FEEL pooling against my deepest barrier.\n\n\"GHAAAA—OH—OH FUCK—OH FUCKING—HRRRNNNNGGGHH—\"\n\nMy back arches so hard I feel vertebrae pop. My tits SLAM together from the force of the convulsion, nipple-to-nipple with a wet PLAP of sweat-slicked skin.\n\n\"Feel that?\" His voice is a growl against my throat where he's bitten a mark that'll bruise purple by morning. \"That's chieftain-seed flooding your spawn-chamber. SEVEN generations of marsh-blood being pumped into your pale belly.\"\n\nI can't respond with words. My mouth is making sounds—\"UNNH-UHH-UHHH-UHH-FUHHH-FUHHH\"—but they're not LANGUAGE anymore. They're just the noise a body makes when it's being BRED for the first time by a man who sees it as breeding-stock.\n\nAnd somewhere deep inside, beneath the lotus-fog and the cock-stretch and the horrifying PLEASURE, a cold hard knot remains.\n\n*I am Aldric. I was Aldric. This body is not ME. They can fill this vessel with seed but they cannot touch what's INSIDE.*\n\n*I just have to survive this. Survive them. Get back to Elara.*\n\nHe stays buried while his cock softens, keeping every drop of his seed trapped inside me. When he finally pulls out, the sound is OBSCENE—a wet SCHLORRRRP followed by a GUSH as his cum starts immediately leaking from my gaped hole.\n\n\"First planting complete.\" He rises, his softening cock swinging heavy and slick with our mixed fluids. \"The tribute is OPENED.

I'm—I'm here for the tribe's pleasure.\"\n\nIf they think I'm BROKEN, they'll be gentler.

The green-filth trained this one well.\"\n\n\"GHHH-AAHH-AAAHHHH!\"\n\nThe chieftain's seed provides horrifying lubrication — thick and hot and ALIVE between my pussy walls and the veteran's different cock. I can feel the cum being DISPLACED, forced deeper by the new invasion, and the veteran's shape is WRONG after the chieftain — thicker at the base, a different curve that scrapes new places while the chieftain's seed squelches around him like warm egg-whites being beaten, frothing into cream that bubbles out with each thrust. My pussy is already learning a second shape, molding to accommodate this one the way it molded to the first, and the realization that I'm becoming a FITTING ROOM for tribal cock makes me—\n\n*SCHLOP-SCHLOP-SCHLOP-SCHLOP*\n\n*CLAP-CLAP-CLAP-CLAP*\n\nTwo rhythms: his cock punching my pussy, and my ass-cheeks applauding his efforts like enthusiastic spectators.\n\n\"L-listen to—UNNH—listen to my—FUCK-DRUMS—\" I gasp out, remembering their terminology, trying to ENGAGE, to prove I'm willing. \"—playing a—AH—AH—war-beat—for you—\"\n\n\"She fucking LEARNS.\" He grabs my hair, wraps it around his fist like a rein, YANKS my head back until I'm staring at the smoke-hazed canopy. \"What else do you know, tribute-meat?\"\n\n\"My—my GRIP-SLIT—\" Each word bounces with his thrusts. \"—is—UNNH—meant for—marsh-cock—my—SPAWN-CHAMBER—wants—AHHH—your—seed—\"\n\n*Keep talking.

My pussy clamps down like a vice and I feel myself SQUIRT around his shaft, the spray hitting my own thighs and the burlap beneath us with a sound like pissing rain.\n\n\"THE TRIBUTE-MEAT IS JUICING AGAIN!\" someone calls from the watching crowd, and laughter ripples through the smoke.\n\n*It's just the body. Just the lotus. Not ME. I'm still HERE.*\n\nMore seed flooding my already-overflowing womb, mixing with the chieftain's cum to create this thick tribal cocktail that's probably already swimming toward my eggs.\n\nWhen he pulls out, a ROPE of combined seed stretches from his cock to my gaping hole before snapping to SPLAT across my ass-cheek.\n\n\"Next.\"\n\n*Up, down. Suck. Clench. Breathe through the nose. Don't bite. Up, down. Don't think about what this means. Up, down. Think about Elara. Think about getting HOME.*\n\n\"HRRRK—HRRRK—GAWK—\"\n\nHis cock hits the back of my throat and my gag reflex FIRES — the muscles clenching around his shaft in violent protest, which apparently feels GOOD to him because he groans and pushes DEEPER. My throat stretches around him like a second pussy, and I can feel every bump and ridge through the thin tissue, can feel my own PULSE beating against his cock where it presses my carotid. My eyes stream. Snot runs from my nose. My hair is wrapped around his fist and he's using it like a HANDLE to fuck my skull.\n\n\"—GLORRRRK—\"\n\n\"She's DROOLING like a bitch in heat! Look at this pale fuck-doll!\"\n\nThe one behind me is pounding with young-man enthusiasm—no rhythm—and my tits are swinging so hard they're actually HURTING from the momentum, heavy flesh flying back and forth like fleshy sacks.\n\n*SCHLOP-SCHLOP-SCHLOP-SCHLOP*\n\n*THWACK-THWACK-THWACK-THWACK*\n\n*GLUK-GLUK-GLUK-GLUK*\n\n\"TAKE IT—TAKE MY SEED IN YOUR GULP-TUBE—HNNNNGGHHHH—\"\n\nHe BLASTS down my throat. The first rope bypasses my mouth entirely — lands directly in my gullet, HOT and thick, and my throat does the rest by reflex, swallowing around his cock in convulsions I can't control. *Gulp-gulp-gulp-gulp*. Each swallow SQUEEZES his shaft, milking out more, and I can track the cum's journey — a hot, heavy slug sliding down my esophagus, pooling in my stomach with a warmth that spreads outward like drinking mulled wine on the wrong end. He holds my head in place and PUMPS more in, and now I'm tasting it — bitter-salt-musk with a thickness that coats my tongue like rendered fat.\n\n\"GWLLK—GWLLK—GWLLK—\"\n\nWhen he finally pulls out, strings of cum and saliva connect us for a moment before snapping.\n\nI cup my own breasts—these fucking WEIGHTS that I still can't believe are attached to my chest—and lift them, press them together, creating a channel of soft flesh. My pale skin is STREAKED with cum now, glistening, and when I look down I can see that earlier loads have pooled in my cleavage.\n\n\"Please,\" I make myself say, \"use my—my GRIP-MEAT—\"\n\nHe straddles my torso and SHOVES his cock between my tits. The shaft slides through my cleavage and I feel it on BOTH SIDES — his heat radiating through breast-flesh from left and right simultaneously, like holding a hot pipe between two pillows. Leftover cum provides lube, SQUELCHING obscenely in the canal he's made of me.\n\n\"TIGHTER.\" He grabs my hands, FORCES me to squeeze harder. \"Make those wobble-weights GRIP.\"\n\nI compress until I can feel his heartbeat through my own flesh — a pulse on each side, left-tit and right-tit receiving his rhythm like two ears pressed to the same drum.\n\nHe starts THRUSTING.\n\nEach push makes the head of his cock emerge from my cleavage toward my face, drooling precum that drips onto my chin, before retreating into the soft prison of my breasts. And the lotus is making every inch of my skin feel like it's made of nerve endings, so even THIS is somehow building heat in my core—\n\n\"Look at this pale fuck-hole SERVING.\" Another warrior has stepped up beside my head. His cock—hard, DARK, dripping—hovers beside my cheek. \"Open that noise-hole.\"\n\n\"Grab her milk-bags!\" someone instructs. \"Use them as HANDLES!\"\n\nHis hands find my tits and SQUEEZE—too hard, inexperienced, PAWING at them like he's kneading dough—and my nipples are so sensitive from the lotus smoke that even his clumsy groping sends lightning to my clit:\n\n\"NNNNH! CAREFUL! They're—they're sensitive—\"\n\n\"She's TALKING TO ME!\" The boy sounds thrilled. \"The tribute-meat is giving me ADVICE!\"\n\n\"Then make her STOP talking!\" The veteran who just fucked me steps forward, his cum-slicked cock still hard, and SLAPS it across my face. \"Open that noise-hole, meat. Time to clean the cock that just bred you.\n\nA warrior with filed teeth BITES my neck while he pounds me, his balls slapping my ass with rhythmic *THWACK-THWACK-THWACK* sounds, and when he cums I count the pulses—*seven*—because counting is something to DO, something to keep the real me anchored.\n\nOn my side: the drake-rider Vash'ti watches from the platform's edge while a veteran SPOONS me, one leg thrown over his hip, his cock churning the cum-soup my pussy has become. She doesn't participate but she COMMENTS: \"Her grip-slit is getting LOOSER. Five more cocks and she'll be properly trained.\"\n\n[Image: 'Five more cocks and she'll be properly trained.'\n\nOn my back with my legs pushed to my shoulders: another young hunter SHAKES as he loses his virginity inside me, cumming in under a minute, apologizing to the laughing crowd while his seed adds to the reservoir.\n\n\"The tribute-meat came AGAIN.\" Commentary from the watching women. \"That's the twelfth time. The collar-whores truly are cock-hungry.\"\n\n*I'm NOT cock-hungry. The lotus is—the body is—I'm not—*\n\n\"NNNNGHHHH—FUCK—FUCK—FFFUUUHHHHH—\"\n\nBetween warriors, the women come.\n\nThey don't participate sexually but they MAINTAIN me—wiping cum from my thighs with rough cloths, checking that my holes aren't torn, giving me water that I drink greedily despite the cum coating my lips.\n\n\"She leaks like a broken jug.\" An older woman with bone jewelry in her hair examines the reservoir of seed pooling on the burlap beneath me. \"Good. The seed takes better when she's overflowing.\"\n\n\"Stop crying, tribute-meat.\" A younger one wipes my cheeks with something that stings. \"You CHOSE this. You OFFERED yourself.\"\n\n*I chose this over watching them all die. Over dying myself. I'll never know.*\n\n\"Her cunt is not swelling.\" Another woman spreads my pussy lips with clinical fingers. \"It is as if some magic preserves her.\"\n\n\"More lotus-smoke.\" Someone waves a burning bundle near my face. \"Her eyes are clearing.\"\n\nThe sweet-rot scent fills my lungs again and the world goes soft around the edges, but somewhere deep down the cold hard knot remains. My old stubbornness. The hero's core.[Choice: You cannot break what refuses to shatter.]Different cock—thinner but LONGER, curved like a scimitar—and he hooks my knees over his shoulders which changes the angle so now he's scraping parts of my pussy that didn't even know they EXISTED, and his thrusting is faster, more desperate, like he's been edging himself watching the chieftain's show.\n\n\"FUCKFUCKFUCK—ANOTHER—ANOTHER COCK—STRETCHING—RUINING—YESSSS!\"\n\nMy mind isn't forming thoughts anymore, just EXPERIENCING, and what I'm experiencing is this: my pussy is a cock-socket. That's its PURPOSE. Every nerve ending confirms it, every spasm of pleasure rewards me for fulfilling my biological destiny as a cum-repository, and when this warrior starts grunting—when his thrusts get erratic—when he BURIES himself and starts pumping—\n\n—adding his load to the chieftain's, my womb now carrying two men's seed that's MIXING inside me, different temperatures, different thickness, I can actually differentiate between them—\n\nHe pulls out. Another takes his place.\n\nThis one flips me over first—my tits CRUSHING against the wet burlap, ass in the air—and when he enters me from behind my ass CLAPS against his hips so loud it echoes:\n\n*CLOP-CLOP-CLOP-CLOP-CLOP!*\n\n\"Listen to those fuck-drums!\"\n\n\"The breeding-stock WANTS it!\"\n\nHe grabs my hair—YANKS my head back until my spine curves like a drawn bow—and RIDES me, his cock slamming in and out while my ass bounces and jiggles and CLAPS, the meat rippling in waves from each impact, and I can feel the cum from the previous two loads getting CHURNED inside me, some of it squirting out around his pistoning cock to run down my thighs—\n\n\"CUMMING—CUMMING ON YOUR COCK—THANK YOU—THANK YOU FOR—\"\n\nThe gratitude is REAL. That's the horror. My pussy is clenching around him in waves of genuine relief, like scratching an itch that's been building for days, and my mouth is thanking him the way you'd thank someone for pulling a splinter — involuntary, breathless, because the ABSENCE of the ache is so sweet that the words just FALL OUT. This body was STARVING and he's feeding it, and every cell is singing grace.\n\n\"—THANK YOU FOR FUCKING MEEEEE!\"[Choice: It all becomes a blur...]",

Twenty-four marsh-bloods have seeded you—we need time to confirm the spawn caught.\" He's fucking harder now, his balls slapping my cum-soaked ass. \"And tribute-meat doesn't take goblin-cock once she's been properly BRED. The seed must be PURE. You'll return to your master only to collect the green-filth's agreement, then you bring the child to us when it's born.\"\n\n*A child. THEIR child. Growing in—*\n\n\"HHHNNNNNNGGGHHHHH—\"\n\nHe SLAMS deep and I feel his cock swell and then—\n\nThe final load. Sealing the covenant. Flooding my already-overflowing womb with chieftain-seed while my traitorous body CLENCHES around him in one last orgasm that I can't stop even though I WANT to—\n\n\"AHHHH—FUCK—FUCKING—GHHAAAAAAA—\"\n\nWhen he pulls out, he catches some of the backflow in his palm and SMEARS it across my belly.\n\n\"Planted,\" he announces to the remaining watchers.\n\n[Choice: That night...]\"These milk-bladders haven't been properly used yet.\"\n\nHe's on his back, making me RIDE him, but his hands are on my tits, MAULING them, squeezing so hard the flesh bulges between his fingers like dough, and every time I bounce—every time I IMPALE myself on his cock because he's making me do the work—they SWING and SLAP and JIGGLE, and he's sucking one nipple while twisting the other, alternating, until both are so swollen they look like purple berries and even the AIR hurts them—\n\n\"GONNA CUM FROM MY TITS—\"\n\n*Is that possible?*\n\nIt is. I do. Pussy clenching on his cock just from the tit-torture while he laughs and BITES and when he cums it's while sucking so hard on my left nipple I swear he's trying to DRINK his own cum through my body—\n\nThey don't wait turns. One underneath—I'm impaled, gravity driving me DOWN onto his cock. One behind—hands spreading my ass cheeks, cock pressing against my asshole that's never been touched, pressing, pressing, pressing until—\n\n*POP!*\n\n\"AAAAIIIIIEEEEEE!\"\n\n—he's in, and the sensation of two cocks RUBBING against each other through the thin wall between my holes is something my brain cannot process. I feel them both — pussy-cock pushing LEFT while ass-cock drags RIGHT — and the friction between them travels through my own tissue like they're SAWING me in half from inside. Every thrust from one makes the other feel BIGGER. The THIRD one grabs my hair — it's so matted with cum now it holds shape when he twists it — and feeds his cock into my screaming mouth. Suddenly every hole is PLUGGED. I'm a junction-box, a meeting-place of meat, sealed at every opening, and when all three thrust at once my entire body COMPRESSES between them like dough being kneaded from three directions.\n\nThey cum at different times. The ass one first—*SPLURT-SPLURT*—hot enough to make my eyes water. Then the mouth one—forcing me to SWALLOW while still getting pounded. The pussy one last, adding another load to the mixture already simmering in my womb.\n\n\"FACE DOWN. ASS UP.\"\n\nHands SLAM my shoulders into the soaked burlap while other hands LIFT my hips, and suddenly I'm presenting like a bitch in heat, spine curved, massive ass pointing at the smoke-hazed ceiling, and I can FEEL how I look—can feel my pussy lips GAPING open from the abuse, cum DROOLING out in thick ropes that stretch toward the floor like obscene stalactites.\n\nThe warrior behind me doesn't even AIM. Just RAMS forward and his cock SINKS into my ruined hole with this *GLLLLOOOORRRRPPP* sound—sliding through three loads of previous cum that squelches out around his shaft in frothy white rings—and then his hips connect with my ass:\n\n*CLOP!*\n\nThe impact enters through my cheeks and travels INWARD — I feel the shockwave pass through the fat, through the muscle underneath, all the way to my PELVIS where it makes his cock shift inside me. Then the flesh REBOUNDS, the cheeks slamming back together a half-second after the hit like meaty applause, and each wobble shifts the angle of his cock minutely, so even after the thrust is done my insides are still being STIRRED by the aftershocks of my own jiggling ass, and when he pulls back for another stroke I can actually feel the shockwave RETURNING, the meat settling back into place just in time for:\n\n*CLOP-CLOP-CLOP-CLOP-CLOP!*\n\n\"The tribute-meat's ass makes music!\" Someone's laughing.\n\n\"AHHHH-AH-AH-AH-AH-YESSSS—CLAP MY FAT ASS—\"\n\n\"It SPEAKS while getting bred!\" Vash'ti's voice cuts through the fuck-haze, mocking. \"The collar-whore NARRATES her own ruining!\"\n\nShe's RIGHT—I can't stop TALKING, can't stop announcing what's happening to me like some demented bard chronicling my own ruin:\n\n\"STRETCHING—SO DEEP—HITTING MY WOMB—GONNA MAKE ME CUM WITH YOUR COCK IN MY GUTSSSS!\"\n\nHis balls are SWINGING forward with each thrust to *THWAP* against my oversensitized clit, and every impact sends lightning up my spine while his cock CHURNS the cum-slurry inside me into FOAM—I can hear it, this wet *SQUELCH-GLORP-SQUELCH* that sounds like someone stirring porridge, except the porridge is WARRIOR SEED and the spoon is COCK—\n\n\"CUMMING—CUMMING ON YOUR COCK—THANK YOU THANK YOU THANNNNNGHK!\"\n\nThe orgasm TEARS through me and my pussy CLAMPS so hard he GRUNTS, his rhythm faltering, and then he's adding HIS load to the others—I've lost count, is this five? Six?—pumping it deep while my cunt milks him like it was DESIGNED for this purpose, which maybe it WAS, maybe the collar BUILT me to be a cum-receptacle for anyone except goblin—\n\nHe pulls out.\n\nA GUSH of mixed seed pours from my gaping hole, splashing onto the already-soaked burlap, thick and clotted with chunks that might be—I don't want to think about what they might be—and before I can process the emptiness, another cock is PRESSING against my asshole again.\n\n\"The seed-trench is overcrowded,\" the warrior observes. \"Time to plant in different soil.\"\n\n\"WAIT—I'M STILL—STILL C—AIIIIEEEEEE!\"\n\nHe doesn't wait. He SHEATHES himself in my ass with one brutal thrust, no warning, no mercy, and my back-hole stretches around him with this wet *SCHLORP* that shouldn't be possible, wouldn't be possible if the previous ass-thrakker hadn't already broken me in—\n\n\"FFFFUUUUCK MY ASSSSS! BREED MY BACK-HOLE!\"\n\n*Where are these WORDS coming from?*\n\n.\n\n\"The milk-bladders,\" someone says. \"Time to put them to work.\"\n\nHands grip my tits from either side—two warriors, one per breast—and they LIFT, pressing them together into a tunnel of pale, sweat-slick cleavage that a third warrior immediately STRADDLES, his balls resting on my solar plexus as his cock slides into the flesh-channel they've created.\n\n\"HNNNGH—FUCK MY TITS—USE MY UDDERS—\"\n\nMy chest gets treated like another hole, the friction of his shaft rasping against skin that's never been used this way, and I have to WATCH—have to watch his cock emerge from between my pushed-together tits, the purple head appearing inches from my face before disappearing again into the valley of my cleavage—\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK.*\n\n\"Stick out your tongue, tribute-meat.\"\n\nI obey. My tongue extends, waiting, and when his cockhead emerges from my tit-tunnel I can TASTE the sweat and my own titty-smell on it, can feel the heat radiating from his piss-slit as it approaches my open mouth—\n\nHe speeds up. The men squeezing my tits ADJUST, pressing harder, creating more friction, and my breasts are being USED, actually used as a FUCK-HOLE, and it's doing something to my pussy—making it CLENCH on nothing, making more cum GLORP out to pool beneath my ass—\n\n\"GONNA CUM FROM GETTING MY TITS FUCKED—\"\n\n\"She CAN'T stop announcing!\" Vash'ti again, delighted by my debasement. \"Like a market-crier selling her own holes!\"\n\nThe titfuck-warrior's rhythm goes ragged. His balls draw up where they're resting on my stomach. And when he cums—\n\n—it's directly onto my face. Ropes of thick, clotted marsh-seed splattering across my nose, my cheeks, into my open mouth, one rope somehow getting INTO MY EYE so I'm half-blinded and STILL opening my mouth for more—\n\n\"THANK YOU! THANK YOU FOR CUMMING ON MY FACE!\"\n\nHe dismounts. Another takes his place. This one wants my mouth INVOLVED—wants me to crane my neck forward and suck his cockhead every time it emerges, wants me to DROOL on it to add lubrication—and the position is IMPOSSIBLE, straining my neck, making my abs burn, but I DO it, I fucking DO it because I'm nothing now but a collection of holes and soft-places designed to make men cum—\n\nOn my tits.\n\nIn my ass.\n\nAcross my face.\n\nDeep in my pussy.\n\nI've lost track of everything except the RHYTHM of being used. Warriors cycle through me like I'm a public well—drinking, drinking, never dry—and my body has become something OTHER, something that exists only to receive and respond.\n\n\"HNNNNGH—FUCK—ANOTHER ONE—CUMMING AGAIN—\"\n\nMy orgasms have become CONTINUOUS, rolling one into the next like waves on a shore, my pussy spasming every time a new cock enters, my nipples shooting pleasure straight to my clit whenever they're pinched or bitten, my ass clenching around whatever's inside it—\n\n\"The tribute-meat has ACCEPTED her place.\" The chieftain's voice cuts through my fuck-fog. He's watching from somewhere nearby, his cock hard again despite having already bred me twice. \"She came to negotiate. She leaves as breeding-stock.\"\n\n\"YESSSSS—\" I'm nodding, AGREEING, words pouring from me like the cum pouring from my holes. \"I'M BREEDING-STOCK! I'M YOUR FUCK-DOT! I'M COCK-SOCKET! HOLE-MEAT! THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU!\"\n\n\"The Kheth-Muur accepts the tribute.\" His voice is FORMAL now, ritualistic. \"We will not trouble your master's territory.\"\n\nSomewhere in the cock-drunk fog of my consciousness, I register that this means—means—\n\n*I did it. I saved Snib's territory. I saved—*[Choice: They all pull out.]",

I'm trying to speak through the gag—trying to say *something*—but all that comes out is this pathetic \"Mmmph-mmmph\" while fresh cum oozes from my pussy onto the platform.\n\nHis teeth close on the leather between my wrists.\n\nThe binding parts like paper—Ash-runner jaws are made for crushing bone. My arms fall free and I nearly scream from the pain of blood rushing back into them, pins and needles racing from shoulder to fingertip. I reach up with shaking hands, fumble with the gag's buckle behind my head. It takes three tries—my fingers are numb, clumsy, sticky with dried cum and my own drool.\n\nWhen it finally falls away,I gasp—\n\n\"Jarkrond—you—*how*—\"\n\nThe guards have heard the platform groan. Footsteps pounding toward us across the rope-bridge.\n\nJarkrond's muzzle rams my waist and simply *lifts*.

THE TRIBUTE!\"\n\nThe platform *shudders* as Jarkrond launches himself toward the edge. I have one heartbeat to realize what he's planning—\n\n\"WAIT—NO—JARKROND DON'T—\"\n\nHe jumps.\n\nThirty-five feet down. Into black water.\n\nMy scream cuts off the moment we hit—*SPLOOOSH*—and suddenly I'm underwater, salt and rot flooding my nose, hands scrabbling for something to grip as the horse's massive body plunges beneath me. The cold is SHOCKING after the breeding platform's humid heat. It punches through the lotus-haze like a fist through cobwebs.\n\nI surface gasping, clinging to Jarkrond's mane as he churns through the murk. His hooves find purchase on something—a submerged root, maybe—and he SURGES forward, dragging me through water that comes up to his chest.\n\n\"SHE'S IN THE WATER! On the GREEN-FILTH HORSE!\"\n\nTorches appear above us. Warriors leaning over platform edges, whooping with sudden excitement. Someone throws a spear—it splashes three feet to our left.\n\n\"GO! GO GO GO—\"\n\nJarkrond doesn't need my encouragement. He's swimming now, his powerful legs churning, his neck stretched forward like an arrow seeking its target. I'm clinging to his back with my thighs clamped around his barrel, my tits *SLAPPING* against his hide with each surge, cold water washing over my abused body and carrying away—oh *gods*—carrying away so much *cum*.\n\n\"*HAHAHAHA!*\"\n\nThe laughter echoes across the marsh. Another spear splashes nearby, but it's a testing throw, not a killing one.\n\n\"RUN, PALE-MEAT!\" someone calls. \"KEEP THAT PUSSY WARM FOR NEXT TIME!\"\n\n\"SHE EARNED HER FREEDOM—LET HER WORK FOR IT!\"\n\nJarkrond finds footing again—a sandbar, a drowned road, I don't know—and suddenly he's RUNNING. Water explodes around us as he transitions from swim to gallop in three thundering strides. My body bounces on his back like a ragdoll, my tits *WHAP-WHAP-WHAPPING* against his flanks so hard I'll have bruises.\n\n\"Ah! AH!—fuck—AH!\"\n\nBehind us: more laughter, cheers. The tribe is ENJOYING this—a proper hunt, a sporting escape. The Kharath has been paid in flesh. My mission for Snib is still done. The territory agreement stands. This chase is just an enjoyable *bonus* for them.\n\nJarkrond veers into a narrow channel between dead trees. Bone-moss slaps my face. My legs are too weak to grip properly and I'm sliding—sliding—*THRACK*—\n\nHis teeth catch my wrist.\n\nHolding me. Dragging me back into position while still running, his hooves finding impossible purchase on submerged logs and mud-slicks that should send us both tumbling. He must have scouted the marshes while I was being fucked.\n\n\"You planned this,\" I gasp into his mane.\n\nHe tosses his head—a clear *shut up and hold on*.\n\nAnother channel. This one narrows until branches scrape both sides. Then opens into—\n\nDesert sand. The boundary. We've reached the edge of the marsh.\n\nJarkrond doesn't slow. If anything he runs HARDER, his hooves transitioning from wet *SPLORTCH* sounds to solid *THUD-THUD-THUD* as we hit dry ground. Behind us, distant but carrying, a farewell...\n\n\"NEXT TIME, PALE-MEAT! NEXT TIME WE PUT ANOTHER MARSH-BABY IN YOU!\"\n\n\"TELL THE GREEN-FILTH HIS TERRITORY IS SAFE!

Only then does he slow to a trot, then a walk. I slide off his back—less dismount, more controlled fall—and collapse onto blessed, dry sand.\n\n\"We did it,\" I pant. \"We actually—\"\n\nHe swings his head around and gives me a look that clearly says: *WE?

      "text": ")Whisperwind *hisses* as I close the distance—three mincing steps that make my ass sway obscenely but cover ground faster than any of them expect. The smoke-blinded warrior swings his spear-butt toward where my head should be.\n\nI'm already lower. These ridiculous spike heels force me into a crouch that Aldric's body could never have managed, and the blow passes through empty air while my blade finds the seam between his ribs. The corrupted steel slides through meat like it's *hungry*, scraping against something vital, and when I twist and rip sideways the way seventeen years of muscle memory demands, he opens from sternum to spine in a spray of arterial red.\n\nFirst *kill*.\n\nThe body hasn't finished falling before I'm moving again.]My heel catches in the reed-mat and I *lurch* forward like a drunkard, one arm windmilling for balance while my tits describe independent arcs that would be comical if they weren't trying to pull me face-first into the platform.\n\nBut the smoke-blind warrior can't see this. He's still coughing, still swinging at where I *was*, and my graceless stumble carries me inside his reach before either of us quite realizes what's happening. Whisperwind moves by instinct—Aldric's muscle memory fighting against arms that are too thin—and the corrupted blade catches him across the throat.\n\nNot deep. Not immediately fatal. But his hands fly to the wound, and I follow with a thrust that my old arms could have driven through chainmail. These arms can barely punch through the leather of his chest-wrap.\n\nThey don't need to. The blade finds meat, finds something vital, and he goes down with a wet gurgle that sounds like drowning.\n\nFirst blood is mine.\n\n*Ephemerals, it actually worked.*\n\nThe remaining warriors hesitate. They expected easy meat.\n\nI don't give them time.\n\n\"Ignisurge.\"\n\nThe word leaves my lips on a breath that tastes of copper and marsh-rot, and fire *blooms* from my outstretched palm—a *wall* that races across the reed-mat flooring in a line that bisects the platform. Three warriors on my side. Two on the other. The flames lick six feet high, hungry and orange, and the screaming starts immediately as one of the warriors catches fire at the shoulder, his fat-matted hair igniting like a torch.\n\n\"KILL THE WITCH!\"\n\nThe three on my side rush as one. Spears leveled. Teeth bared.\n\nI meet the first thrust with a parry that sends vibrations shrieking up arms that are too soft for this, but the motion flows into the serpentine hip-rotation I can do now—that grinding, sweeping arc that starts deep in my belly and ripples outward through this pelvis that's set at angles meant for *birthing*, not fighting.\n\nThe parry becomes a redirect. His spear-point slides past my ribs close enough to kiss skin. My riposte opens his forearm to the bone.\n\nHe screams. I spin—heels *scraping* against the reed-mat, tits *whipping* around with their own momentum—and the spin carries Whisperwind through a horizontal arc that the second warrior walks directly into. The blade takes him across the belly[, not deep but enough to spill loops of grey-pink intestine that steam in the humid air].[Choice: Two down.]\"Come then, pale-meat,\" he grins, teeth filed to points.\n\nThe warrior who faces me is nothing special—not the strongest, not the fastest, just another scarred body among dozens. But he has something I don't: a body that *works* the way it's supposed to.\n\nI lunge—Whisperwind singing through humid air—and he sidesteps with insulting ease. A casual lean—that's all—and my blade whistles past his ribs while his spear-shaft *CRACKS* across my ass hard enough to make the flesh ripple.\n\n\"Too slow!\" He's laughing now. They're ALL laughing. \"Those milk-sacks throw you forward!\"\n\nHe's right. These fucking tits have their own momentum, dragging me into overextensions Aldric would never have made. When I try to recover into a defensive stance, my heel catches the reed-mat and I stumble sideways, arms wheeling.\n\n*CRACK.*\n\nHis spear-butt finds my ass again. The impact sends me lurching, and now I'm being *herded*—each dodge followed by another stinging blow that drives me toward the platform's edge where warriors lean against their spears and make wagers on how many strikes before I fall.\n\n\"Ventusfury!\"\n\nWind erupts from my palm, driving smoke from the fire-pit toward his eyes. But he's already moving—these warriors have fought magic-users before. He rolls beneath my gust and comes up *behind* me, spear-shaft cracking across both cheeks in rapid succession.\n\n*CRACK-CRACK-CRACK.*\n\n\"Dance for us, fuck-hole!\"\n\nI spin with Whisperwind extended—a desperate sweep that should open him from hip to shoulder. He *drops*, going boneless to the mat, and my blade passes through air while my breasts continue their arc, chains jingling. The momentum carries me full-circle and when I stop, dizzy and panting, he's already striking.\n\nThe spear-shaft catches me behind the knees.\n\nI go down *hard*.\n\nReed-mat slams into my palms. My tits swing down and *THWAP* against the platform, the impact making stars burst behind my eyes. This position—on all fours like a bitch waiting to be mounted—sends the warriors into fresh howls.\n\n\"Look! She presents!\"\n\n\"Twenty bone-tokens says she's dripping already!\"\n\nI try to rise. His foot plants between my shoulder blades and *shoves*. My arms give out and suddenly I'm face-down, these obscene udders compressed beneath me, ass still raised because my knees won't unlock.\n\n\"Stay down, meat.\"\n\nThe spear-tip traces my spine. Slow. Deliberate. Down between my shoulder blades, along the valley of my lower back, into the cleft between my cheeks where it *taps* against the metal thong.\n\n*Tap. Tap.

I stay down, trembling, listening to their laughter.\n\n\"Keth-ral wins!\" someone shouts. \"The pale-meat couldn't last sixty heartbeats!\"\n\nThe warrior—Keth-ral—grabs my hair and yanks my head back. His breath is hot against my ear.\n\n\"By the laws of combat, you're mine to claim first.\"\n\n[Image: The breeding platform rises above the carnage like an altar above a charnel house.\nThey don't even let me walk.\n\nKeth-ral throws me over his shoulder and my world inverts. Blood rushes to my skull. His shoulder-bone digs into my diaphragm like a fist, and my tits — freed from any pretense of containment — hang straight down his back like two sacks of warm dough, swinging and SLAPPING his kidneys with each step across the rope-bridge. The weight of them pulls at my chest from a direction I've never felt — straight DOWN, stretching skin, dragging at muscle, my nipples pointing at black water thirty-five feet below. My hair hangs too, a black curtain that sticks to his sweaty back, tangling with the leather straps crossing his shoulders. I can feel individual strands catching and pulling at the roots with each bounce.\n\n\"Feel this?\" He calls to the other warriors following us across the rope-bridge. \"Soft as drake-belly! The green-filth feeds his cunts well!\"\n\nSomeone reaches up and pulls my metal thong aside. Fingers—not Keth-ral's, someone else's—slide along my slit.\n\n\"Soaked through! The defeat-juice runs down her thighs!\"\n\nI'm still trying to process what happened.\n\nSixty heartbeats. That's how long Aldric lasted in the body that used to kill dragons. One warrior. One spear. Sixty heartbeats and three spanks on my jiggling ass and the fight was over — not because he was better than me but because my own TITS threw me off balance, because my own HIPS wouldn't hold a combat stance, because when his spear-butt cracked across my rear I stumbled on heels designed for bedrooms, not battlefields. I lost to my own body more than I lost to him—\n\n*CRACK.*\n\nSpeaking of which. Keth-ral's free hand has found my upturned rear again, palm connecting with enough force to make the flesh RIPPLE outward in waves I can *feel* traveling through my hips. The warriors following us on the bridge make sounds of appreciation.\n\n\"Fat like swamp-melon,\" one calls in heavily-accented Valarian.\n\n\"Save some for us, Keth! Don't split her open before we get our turn!\"\n\nTheir laughter is wet. *Gurgling*. Everything about these marsh-dwellers sounds like drowning.\n\nThe platform materializes through bone-moss curtains—a circular space built around a massive dead cypress trunk, white as stripped bone. There are braziers at cardinal points, already lit, already *smoking*. The smell hits me before I see the source: lotus incense, thick and sweet and cloying, mixing with something else—\n\nOld sex. *Generations* of it. Soaked into the wood itself.\n\nAnd in the center: a bed.\n\nNot rough mats. Not bare planks. An actual *bed*—layered white burlap over what looks like marsh-moss, surprisingly pristine, maintained with something approaching religious dedication. A restraint post rises adjacent to it, eight feet of polished wood with iron rings at various heights, leather straps hanging loose and worn soft from use.\n\nKeth-ral dumps me onto it.\n\nThe moss gives beneath my weight with surprising gentleness, and for one disorienting moment the *comfort* of it makes everything worse—this is a *breeding station*—maintained for one purpose—\n\n\"Never seen proper marsh-meat before, has she?\" Keth-ral laughs, already stroking himself. The thing between his legs is *nothing* like mine used to be—dark as fermented tree-bark, mapped with veins thick as marsh-reeds, the whole shaft glistening with some mixture of sweat and sheath-grease that makes it look *oiled*. Fourteen inches of breeding-tool, uncircumcised, the foreskin rolled back to reveal a head that's almost purple-black, already drooling precum thick as tree-sap.[Choice: They surround you.",

My cunt *clenches* at the thought of those ridges dragging against—\n\n*No. NO.*\n\n\"Strip her.\" The chieftain's voice carries from his bone-throne, positioned at the platform's edge where he can watch everything. \"Let's see what we're breeding.\"\n\nVash'ti—the female drake-rider—approaches with her obsidian knife.

No longer compressed by the armor, they spill out with their own disgusting momentum, each one swinging outward before colliding back together with a wet *SLAP* of sweat-slick flesh. The weight of them pulls my shoulders forward even lying on my back, and I hear the warriors make sounds that are half appreciation, half *hunger*.\n\n\"Drake-mother's udders!\"\n\n\"Look at those milk-sacks wobble!\"\n\n\"Pale as lotus-flesh—you can see the veins through the skin!\"\n\nShe *YANKS* my thong.\n\n\"AAAHH!\"\n\nThe metal cuts INTO me before snapping of its own volition, the edges dragging across my labia hard enough to leave marks, and suddenly I'm NAKED.

When I breathe—and I'm breathing FAST, panicked rabbit-breaths—they wobble. Independent oscillations of flesh that catch every warrior's eye.\n\n\"First blood in battle.\" Keth-ral positions himself, and I feel the heat of his cock before it touches me. Radiating warmth like a furnace-heated iron. \"First seed in flesh.\"\n\nThe head of his cock touches my entrance.\n\n*Oh gods.*\n\nHe doesn't push yet. Just HOLDS there, letting the weight of his cock rest against my opening, letting me FEEL it.\n\n\"The Kheth-Muur thank you for your donation,\" he says formally, like this is a fucking ceremony.

I feel the walls RIPPLE as they accommodate — individual folds of flesh being ironed flat by his advancing cock, each one sending its own specific signal to my brain. Not pain. Not pleasure. Something my nervous system has no category for. The sensation of being OPENED, of internal space that was sealed shut being CLAIMED, inch by inch, my body reshaping itself around an invader in real time.\n\nThe ridge of his cockhead dragging against walls that have never been touched. The thick veins of his shaft spreading me wider than I knew I could spread. The heat of him like a brand searing my insides. And at the deepest point—\n\n\"F- FUCK!\"\n\n—his tip kisses my cervix.\n\nMy cervix. The entrance to my womb. My thrakking *womb* that shouldn't exist, and he's PRESSING against it, making it *ache*—agony braided with a sweetness that has no right to exist.\n\nKeth-ral doesn't move. Just stays BURIED there, his pelvis flush against mine, his dark cock completely sheathed inside my pale body. His pulse throbs through his shaft—THROB-THROB-THROB—each beat making his cock *twitch* against my stretched walls.\n\n\"There,\" he breathes, and his face is inches from mine now, bronze skin sheened with sweat, ritual scars catching the brazier-light like white war-paint. \"Now you're not a warrior anymore.\"\n\nHis words hit me harder than any spell.\n\nBecause he's RIGHT.\n\nThis moment—this cock buried to the root inside me—has changed something fundamental. Whatever I was before, I'm something else now. Something with a man's cock pressed against the entrance to her womb. Something PENETRATED. Something FUCKABLE.\n\n\"HNNNAAAHHH—haahh—haahhh—\"\n\nEach breath tears out of me in these pathetic little gasps as Keth-ral holds himself balls-deep, his cock throbbing inside my stretched channel.\n\n\"Breathes like virgin,\" Keth-ral grins down at me, his bronze chest glistening with sweat already. \"But grips like whore.\"\n\n\"Nnnnffff—\"\n\n\"You fought well,\" he says conversationally, like we're having tea instead of him BURIED in my cunt. \"That wind-magic? Almost caught me.\" He pulls back another inch. The wet SQUELCH echoes off the platform. \"But you move like cow with those udders.\"\n\n\"F-fuck you—AAAHHH!\"\n\nHe SLAMS back in, his balls making a wet SPLAT against my ass, and my tits ROCKET in opposite directions before colliding back together with enough force that it actually HURTS.\n\n\"See?\" He's laughing now, this young warrior who couldn't best me in real combat but defeated this ridiculous body with ease. \"Your tits fight each other more than you fought me!\"\n\nThe other warriors laugh too—that wet, gurgling sound—and Keth-ral starts to MOVE.\nImmediate pistoning thrusts that make the entire breeding bed creak. His cock slides out until just the head remains, then PLUNGES back to slam against my cervix.\n\n*SCHLICK-SCHLICK-SCHLICK*\n\n\"Haaahh—haaahhh—st-stop—hnnngh—\"\n\n\"Stop?\" He hilts himself particularly deep and GRINDS, his pubic bone mashing my clit. \"Your cunt says different, pale-meat.\"\n\n\"HNNNGHHH!\"\n\nMy whole body JOLTS. My tits—those massive pale globes that had flopped to either side—WOBBLE violently with the impact, each one jiggling for three full seconds before settling. The wet SLAP of his pelvis hitting mine echoes across the platform.\n\nTHRUST.\n\n\"You tried to fight me, and fell on your face.\"\n\nTHRUST.\n\n\"With your fat ass in the air.\"\n\nTHRUST.\n\n\"You're not built for fighting anymore, pale-meat.\"\n\nHe releases my tits and they FALL, flopping back to their natural resting state, nipples pointing at the bone-moss canopy above. His hands move to my hips instead—grabbing the soft flesh there, using the curve of my waist to pull me harder onto his cock.\n\n\"You're built for THIS.\"\n\nTHRUST. THRUST. THRUST-THRUST-THRUST.\n\nThe pace is increasing. The wet sounds are getting LOUDER. My pussy—my fucking PUSSY that I hate, that shouldn't exist—is making noises that sound like someone stirring a pot of thick porridge. *SCHLRP-SCHLRP-SCHLRP*. My body has lubricated itself to obscene levels, welcoming his invasion, FACILITATING it.\n\n\"She's close,\" Vash'ti observes clinically from her position beside the bed. \"See how her hole flutters? How her belly trembles?\"\n\n\"N-no, I'm not—I won't—\"\n\nKeth-ral shifts his grip—both hands on my tits now, using them as HANDLES to pull me onto his cock—and the new angle is—\n\n\"You're going to cum on marsh-cock while the whole tribe watches.\" He's watching my face now, reading every flicker of thought, ENJOYING my desperate denial. \"You're going to cum on the cock of the warrior who SPANKED you like a child during your sad attempt at combat.\"\n\n\"HNNNNAAAAAAHHHHH!\" I won't—\"\n\n\"You WILL.\"\n\nHe changes angle.\n\nJust a slight shift of his hips, just a small adjustment of where his cock is hitting—but everything is DIFFERENT—a spot inside me that's lighting up like a festival bonfire, a bundle of nerves that Aldric never knew existed because ALDRIC NEVER HAD THEM.\n\n\"Haahh—haahh—hnngh—please—please stop—if you don't stop I'll—I'll—\"\n\n\"Look at me,\" he commands, and my eyes snap to his against my will. Those dark eyes, that bronze face twisted in pleasure as he uses my body. \"Look at me when your virgin cunt cums.\"\n\n\"I—I can't—HNNNNGGAAAHHH!\"\n\nIt hits like lightning. Like drowning. Like dying.\n\nSomething DETONATES behind my pubic bone — a chain reaction of muscle contractions that race from my entrance to my cervix in a wave I can TRACK, each ring of muscle firing a quarter-second after the last. My spine arches so hard my shoulder blades leave the bed, and these tits — slick with sweat, marked with his handprints — thrust skyward like they're reaching for something. The orgasm doesn't feel like pleasure. It feels like my body BETRAYING my combat defeat into sexual surrender, converting the adrenaline of the fight directly into cunt-spasms around the cock of the man who beat me. And I'm SQUIRTING—\n\n*SPLOOOOSH*\n\n—fluid GEYSERING around his cock, spraying his abs, soaking the bed, and I'm SCREAMING—not words, just this long, broken wail as my first orgasm as a woman DESTROYS me.\n\n\"THERE!\" Keth-ral roars triumphantly. \"The pale-meat BREAKS!\"\n\nThe warriors are cheering. Laughing. My cunt is still spasming, still SQUEEZING, milking his cock with these rhythmic pulses I can't control, and he's still FUCKING me through it, extending it, making it WORSE—\n\n\"HNNNGH—HAAAHH—PLEEEAAASE—\"[Minigame]",

Tribute-cunt. It doesn't sting anymore. It just FITS, the way a key fits a lock, and that absence of sting is more terrifying than any pain.\n\nThen he KISSES me.\n\nHis filed teeth scrape my lips. His tongue INVADES my mouth, tasting of whatever the Sandwalkers drink, tasting of CONQUEST. The bone-beads woven into his ochre-stiffened hair-ridge CLICK against my forehead as he tilts his head, deepening the kiss, claiming my mouth the way he just claimed my womb—[Choice: And you... kiss him back.]*No.*\n\nSomewhere beneath the lotus-fog and the pleasure-lightning and the absolute RUIN of my dignity, something flickers.\n\n*Elara.*\n\nHer face.

Force myself to *focus*.\n\n\"Is that—nnngh—is that all you've got?\"\n\nThe words come out slurred, ruined by the cock still pumping into my depths, but they *land*.

His hips grinding, trying to get DEEPER while his cock flexes and SPURTS and FLOODS and I'm making these horrible *sounds*—\n\n\"Haaahh—HAAAH—s-so much—\"\n\nMy legs kick involuntarily, heels drumming against his back as he BREEDS me, and the whole tribe is CHEERING—\n\n\"SEED HER!\"\n\n\"PUMP THAT PALE WOMB!\"\n\n\"MAKE HER BELLY SWELL!\"\n\nKeth-ral wipes his cock on my face.\n\nThe still-hot shaft drags across my cheek, my lips, leaving trails of cum and my own pussy juice, and my eyes cross trying to follow it—\n\n\"Good hole,\" he grunts, then rolls off to the side.\n\nI'm still lying there, legs splayed, cum OOZING from my fucked-open cunt in thick rivers, when he leans over—\n\nAnd KISSES me.\n\nHis filed teeth scrape my lips. His tongue, tasting of fermented marsh-fruit, pushes into my mouth. And the whole tribe LAUGHS as I kiss him back because what else can I do? What else can tribute-meat do but show gratitude for being bred?\n\nWhen he pulls away, there's a strand of spit connecting us.\n\n\"Next warrior,\" he calls out lazily. \"She's ready.\"\n\n\"HAAAHHH—\"\n\n*For Elara. This is for home. I need to make it through.*\n\nMy body doesn't care about noble reasoning. My body is CUMMING again, squirting around this stranger's cock while he grips my ass hard enough to bruise—\n\n\"She's got the breeding hips!\" He's LAUGHING as he pounds me. \"Feel this ASS—\"\n\n*WHAP WHAP WHAP!*\n\nHis hips smashing into my cheeks make them RIPPLE, and everyone can see it, everyone can see how my pale flesh BOUNCES and JIGGLES and—\n\n\"I'm—I'm cumming—\" Did I say that out loud? \"Please—please fill me—I need your cum—\"\n\nThe words pour out of me like the seed pouring out of my cunt. Survival. It's all survival.\n\n*Time blurs.*\n\nI'm on my back again. Someone's cock between my tits—my stupid massive tits that I'm pushing together with my own hands, creating a slick valley for him to fuck—\n\n\"HNNGH—Here it COMES—\"\n\nCum fountains up from between my breasts. It arcs through lotus smoke, splatters across my face, my throat, pools in the hollow between my collarbones—\n\nThree cocks now. One in each hand, one in my mouth.\n\nMy arms ache from jerking them. My jaw aches from stretching. My throat aches from gagging. But I work them all, moaning like the whore they want—\n\n\"MMMPHH—MMMMPH—\"\n\nThe one in my mouth swells—\n\nCum floods my throat. I'm swallowing, swallowing, but it's too much—it spurts from my nose, dribbles from the corners of my stretched lips—\n\nThe ones in my hands go off—\n\nEvery hole is filled. One warrior pounds my pussy, another claims my ass, and a third fucks my throat—\n\n\"GLUK—GLUK—GLUK—\"\n\nMy body is just MEAT being used by three cocks, my tits swinging and SLAPPING with the rhythm, and somewhere in the lotus-fog I'm CUMMING again—\n\nOr still—\n\nI can't tell anymore—\n\nThe chieftain finally rises from his throne.\n\nThe other warriors pull back, leaving me sprawled in the center of the breeding bed. I'm GLAZED in cum. It's in my hair. My eyelashes. Running from every hole. My pussy is GAPING, still pushing out thick globs of seed from the five—six?—loads already pumped inside.\n\n\"You survived the warriors,\" he says simply. His cock is MASSIVE. The biggest yet. \"Let's see if you survive the chief.\"\n\nHis weight drives the air from my lungs. His cock SPEARS into my cum-flooded cunt with a wet *SCHLOOOOORP* and suddenly he's deeper than anyone has been—\n\n\"AAAAAAHHHHH—\"\n\n\"Good,\" he grunts against my ear. \"SCREAM.\"\n\nAnd I do. I scream as he breeds me with slow, DEEP strokes that push all the cum already inside me out in wet spurts. I scream as my legs wrap around him WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. I scream as I cum on his massive cock...\n\n\"Please—\" I'm babbling now. \"Please—breed me—make me carry marsh-warriors—\"\n\n\"You'll carry until your belly drags the ground,\" he promises, and his cock SWELLS inside me — I feel it thicken, feel the head FLARE against my cervix like a fist opening — and then he ERUPTS.\n\nThe sensation is DIFFERENT from the warriors. They came in spurts. The chieftain comes in a FLOOD — one continuous hot POUR that I feel pressurizing my already-stuffed womb. The cum from six previous loads compresses, rearranges, makes room for what their chief is depositing. My belly actually SHIFTS — I feel it push outward, the skin tightening over a womb packed beyond capacity, and the overflow squirts out around his shaft in thick gouts that splash against my inner thighs with the sound of someone pouring porridge from a height.\n\nWhen he pulls out, cum POURS from me.\n\nA waterfall of marsh-seed splattering on the bed, and I'm SOBBING from sheer *overload*—\n\n\"The tribute is accepted,\" the chieftain announces. \"The Kheth-Muur will migrate north.\"\n\nThe tribe cheers.\n\nAnd I lie there. Bred. Pumped full. Survived.\n\n*Aldric the Great is truly dead.*\n\n*I'm Elise now.*\n\n*And I did what I had to do.*[Choice: Later...",

      "text": "My lips part and my tongue finds his and something in my brain just SHUTS OFF. Suddenly I'm SUCKING on his tongue, actually NURSING on it like it's providing nutrients, tasting the bitter ochre that's smeared on his lips, tasting his VICTORY, and when he pulls back with a wet *POP* there's a string of spit connecting our mouths that stretches and stretches until it SNAPS—\n\n\"Haahhh... hahhh...\" I'm panting as he rolls off me, my tits WOBBLING back into their natural teardrop shape after being compressed, and there's cum—SO much cum—already OOZING from my stretched cunt, making obscene wet sounds as it bubbles out.\n\nThe tribe is CHEERING.\n\n\"Well seeded, Keth-ral!\"\n\n\"The pale-meat's leaking like a broken water-jug!\"\n\n\"Who claims second breeding?\"\n\nKeth-ral collapses beside me on the burlap, laughing, his softening cock still DROOLING the last drops of seed onto his thigh. He turns his head and grins at me—those filed teeth catching the brazier-light—and says, \"Your cunt was MADE for marsh-cock, tribute-bitch. We shall pump so many babies into that pale belly...\"\n\nAnd instead of horror, instead of revulsion, I feel something else.\n\n\"Haahh!\" The sound escapes me, high and breathy, and more cum spurts from my hole—painting my inner thighs with thick white streaks.\n\nAn older warrior is already climbing onto the bed.\n\n\"HNNNNNGHHHAAAAAHHH!\"\n\nHe's on top of me, my legs pushed back until my knees are beside my ears, this mating press that makes my cunt feel like it goes on FOREVER, like he could thrust straight through me and out my mouth. \"Had these cut when I was fifteen. Every ridge blessed by the Bone-Mother to breed better warriors.\"\n\n*SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP*\n\n\"Haahh—hahh—oh FUCK oh fuck the ridges are—HNNNNGHH!\"\n\nHis cock has ritual scarification — raised keloid spirals carved into the shaft itself, wound tight as corkscrew threading. When he slides into my cum-slick cunt I feel each ridge CATCH on my swollen walls like fingers dragging across wet silk. The first spiral hits my g-spot and my vision whites out. The second drags across tissue so sensitive I can count the individual bumps — one, two, three, four — each one plucking a different nerve. By the time he's fully seated the spirals have mapped my entire channel, and every micro-movement sends the pattern ROTATING inside me like a key turning in a lock I didn't know I had.\n\n\"...plant another warrior in that soft belly...\"\n\n\"Yes—HAAAHHH—yes please—please put babies in me—\"\n\n*Where are these words COMING from?*\n\nI know where. From the same place that makes my hips LIFT to meet each thrust.\n\n\"HRRRRNNNGHH!\"\n\nHe ERUPTS without warning, cock pulsing against my cervix, and I feel the cum spurting directly into my womb to mix with what's already there.\n\nSomeone rolls me onto my stomach and I'm on all fours, these massive tits swaying heavily with their own weight, nipples brushing the burlap as another warrior—younger, eager-fucks me from behind.\n\n*SHLORP-SQUISH-SHLORP*\n\n\"Her pussy's so USED already,\" he laughs.\n\nThere's another cock at my face—one of the veterans, grey starting to show in his hair-ridge—and he's rubbing his leaking tip across my lips, painting them with precum until they GLISTEN.\n\n\"Open up, tribute-whore.\"\n\nThe lotus smoke has soaked into me through my lungs and is now coming out through my SKIN — I can feel it, a warm tingling that turns every square inch of flesh into an erogenous zone. The breeze from someone walking past makes my nipples ACHE. The burlap beneath my ass feels like fingers. My cunt produces a steady trickle of clear slick that I can feel running down the crease of my ass even when no one's touching me — my body lubricating itself for the NEXT cock, always preparing, always open for business. Each breath pulls more smoke in and my thoughts get slipperier, harder to hold, sliding toward the next orgasm like water finding the drain.\n\nI'm on my back again—how did I get here?—and there's a cock between my tits.\n\n\"Push them together, pale-meat.\"\n\nMy hands press my breasts together without permission — the flesh overflows my grip, warm and slippery with mixed cum and sweat, and I have to SQUEEZE to maintain the channel. I can feel the cock between them like a hot bar of iron sliding through butter, the ridge of his cockhead catching on my breastbone with each upstroke, the shaft displacing soft tissue that bulges around it in waves. The friction heats my cleavage until it feels like my tits are running a fever of their own.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP*\n\nHis balls slap against the underside of my tits with each thrust, and his cockhead emerges at the top of my cleavage, purple-red and angry, drooling precum that pools in the hollow of my throat.\n\n\"These tits were MADE for fucking,\" he grunts.\n\n\"Mmmhmm—\" I agree, because there's ANOTHER cock in my mouth, this one so thick my jaw aches, and someone else is in my cunt—always someone in my cunt now, I'm never empty for more than a few seconds—and my hands—\n\nThere are cocks in my hands too.\n\nI'm COVERED in dicks. Surrounded. Buried. A forest of throbbing marsh-meat all aimed at me, all using me, all WANTING me, and the lotus smoke makes it feel like I'm floating even as I'm being fucked into the breeding bed.\n\n\"Look at her FACE,\" Vash'ti's voice cuts through the haze. \"She's gone cock-stupid.\"\n\n*SPLLLLRT*\n\nThe cock between my tits erupts, cum fountaining up to splatter across my chin and neck, pooling in my collarbones, and I GIGGLE—actually fucking GIGGLE—as the warm seed drips down my chest.\n\nThe cock in my mouth ERUPTS without warning—*SPLLLLRRRRTTT*—and suddenly my cheeks are BULGING with hot seed, so much I can't swallow fast enough, thick ropes of it BURSTING past my lips and running down my chin in twin rivers that drip-drip-drip onto my heaving tits.\n\n\"GLLLRRRK—HRRRRK—\" I'm gagging but I'm also CUMMING, my pussy clenching around whoever's inside me—I've lost track, they blur together now—and the sensation of being filled at both ends makes my eyes roll back until I'm staring at the bone-moss canopy through fluttering lashes.\n\n\"*Swallow it, tribute-whore*.\"\n\nI TRY. Gods help me, I try. My throat works desperately, *GULP-GULP-GULP*, but there's too much, there's ALWAYS too much, and cum bubbles from my nostrils as I choke on what feels like a pint of marsh-seed.\n\nSomeone YANKS my hair—fingers tangled in sweat-soaked black strands—and my head is wrenched back, throat stretching into a straight line that lets the cock slide DEEPER.\n\n\"GLLLLLLRRRRRKKKK!\"\n\n\"This hole's been neglected,\" someone observes.\n\n\"HNNNGH—wait—not there—HAAAAAHHHHH!\"\n\nThe first finger breaches me and my whole body JOLTS, these massive tits swinging forward to SLAP together with a meaty *THWACK*, and then there's not a finger anymore—there's a COCK, thick and insistent, pressing against my virgin ass with the inevitability of a siege ram.\n\n\"Relax, tribute-meat. Your body was BUILT for this.\"\n\n\"Nnnghh—too big—it's too—FUUUUUCKKK!\"\n\nHe doesn't wait. The ring of muscle that's been clenching shut since the moment I became female STRETCHES around his cockhead — and the sensation is entirely different from my cunt. No wetness to ease the way, just pressure and heat and the sick feeling of something going IN where everything should come OUT. My sphincter fights him for two terrible seconds, then SURRENDERS, and he pops through into a space that's tighter, hotter, DRIER than my pussy. I can feel him and the cock in my cunt separated by a wall so thin they GRIND against each other through it — two invaders shaking hands through the membrane of my dignity—\n\n\"*SCHLORP-SQUELCH-SCHLORP*\"\n\nSomeone shoves a cock into my screaming mouth and I'm stuffed at every hole, used from every angle, nothing but a collection of warm wet passages for marsh-cocks to empty themselves into.\n\nMy tits have been bouncing for so long the connective tissue beneath them has gone from aching to NUMB to this deep, hot throb like a second heartbeat in my chest. The skin underneath is chafed raw from swinging against my ribs. My nipples have been hard for hours — not from cold but from overstimulation, the areolae puffy and swollen to twice their normal size, so sensitive that even the AIR moving across them as they swing sends jolts straight to my cunt.\n\n\"BRING THE TRIBUTE TO ME.\"\n\nThe chieftain's voice cuts through the lotus haze. Kareth-Suul.\n\nHands haul me up—I'm DRIPPING, cum running down my thighs, leaking from my ass, smeared across my face and tits and belly—and they CARRY me to where he sits on his bone-throne, carried like the breeding-tribute I've become.\n\nHis cock juts from his leather wrap like a weapon—longer than the others, thick as my wrist, the head almost purple with backed-up need. He's been WATCHING this whole time. Waiting. Letting his warriors have their fill before claiming the prize himself.\n\n\"Sit.\"\n\nOne word. A command. And my traitorous body OBEYS, climbing into his lap, my thighs spreading over his as I position my well-used cunt above his waiting shaft.\n\n\"The Kheth-Muur recognize your tribute,\" he says formally, one hand gripping my hip, the other reaching up to SQUEEZE my left tit hard enough to make me gasp. \"You have served well, pale-meat. Our migration shall turn from your master's territory.\"\n\n\"Th-thank you—HNNNNGHAAAHHH!\"\n\nHe PULLS me down and gravity does the rest.\n\nHis cock enters through a pussy so stretched and cum-flooded that the first four inches meet no resistance at all — just a wet SCHLORP as he displaces the seed of every warrior who came before him. Then inch five hits something the others didn't reach. Inch six pushes PAST it. By inch seven my hands are clawing his shoulders and I'm making sounds I don't recognize, and when the final inch seats him fully my cervix KISSES his cockhead and I feel it — every previous load of cum trapped between us, compressed, heated, his cock stirring it all together inside me like a pestle in a mortar full of seed.\n\n\"But we shall keep you for three more days,\" he growls against my ear, his filed teeth scraping my earlobe. \"To ensure the tribute is... *complete*.\"\n\n\"Y-yes—HAAHHH—yes, use me—breed me—HNNNGH!\"[Choice: Later...",

He circles, spear held low, watching my footwork instead of my flesh.\n\n\"Fuck-doll fights like a *serpent*,\" he says. \"But you're *bleeding*, pale-meat.\"\n\nI show teeth. \"So are *you*.\"\n\nHis eyes flick down—instinct, checking his body for wounds he might have missed.\n\n\"Ventusfury.\"\n\nWind *slams* into him from the side. He stumbles, plants his spear to catch himself—all the force I can muster with my reserves guttering.\n\nThree steps and I'm inside his reach, looking up into eyes that have just realized he's going to die.\n\nWhisperwind goes in under his chin and doesn't stop until it finds brain.\n\nI spin toward the fire-wall—dying now, the flames guttering as they consume the reed-mat's moisture—and I see the two warriors on the other side preparing to charge through. The one whose hair I ignited is still burning, still screaming, stumbling toward the platform's edge while his companions ignore him.\n\nAbove me: the dry *click* of a blowgun being loaded.\n\nI twist—too slow. The dart *grazes* my shoulder instead of burying itself deep, slicing a furrow through skin before spinning away into the smoke. But even that glancing contact is enough. Cold spreads from the wound like ice water in my veins, the venom on the dart-tip seeping into the cut. My left arm goes heavy. Then numb.\n\nI clamp my good hand over the wound—shallow, barely bleeding—and look up into the bone-trophy canopy where the blowgunner crouches, already loading another dart. The structure he's standing on is part of the web of ropes and branches that holds this entire platform together—and one of those ropes extends down to the support post beside me.\n\n\"Ignisurge.\"\n\nThe word comes out through gritted teeth. The fire that blooms from my palm is weaker than before—I'm emptying faster than I should—but it's enough to catch the rope. Hemp blackens. Smokes. *Parts*.\n\nThe blowgunner grabs for the trunk, catches it, but the second gunner beside him isn't so lucky. I hear the scream. The impact. The wet *crack* of legs breaking on the platform below.\n\nThe fire-wall collapses.\n\nThe two remaining platform-warriors come through the embers with spears leveled and murder in their eyes, and behind them I hear something that makes my blood run colder than any paralytic.\n\nSix legs. Moving in a flowing wave-pattern. The *scrape* of scales against wood.\n\nAnd a voice, female, cutting through the chaos like obsidian through flesh:\n\n\"*Enough.*\"\n\nThe warriors halt mid-charge.\n\nShe emerges from behind the Chieftain's bone-throne on twelve feet of grey-green scales and crocodilian hunger, six legs carrying it with an eerie, flowing gait that makes the platform *shudder* with each step. The drake's head swings toward me, forward-facing eyes fixing on my position with predatory intelligence, and its mouth opens to display triple rows of teeth that interlock like the bars of a cage.\n\nVash'ti sits astride its back like she was born there.\n\nThe scarification across her ribs catches the firelight, blue-black pigment marking her as something more than a common warrior. Drake-scale beads glint in her cornrowed hair. A ten-foot bone lance rests across her thigh.\n\nShe looks at the bodies scattered across the platform. Looks at me—blood-soaked, panting, my left arm hanging useless at my side, my chain-mail bikini askew with one triangle barely covering a nipple gone hard from the cold. Just the cold.\n\n\"You fight well for a fuck-doll,\" she says in Valarian better than the Chieftain's. \"But I doubt you've ever faced a *drake*.\"\n\nThe Chieftain hasn't risen from his throne. He's *watching*.\n\nMy left arm won't respond at all now. The numbness has spread past my shoulder now, creeping toward my chest. I have minutes before the whole arm is useless deadweight.\n\n\"Come *on* then,\" I say, and my voice sounds steadier than I feel.\n\nVash'ti smiles. It doesn't reach her eyes.\n\n\"Keth'ral,\" she commands. \"*Hunt.*\"\n\n[Image: My sword struggles to mock me when it's painted red.\n\n[Battle]",

Ice RIPS across the drake's scales—a desperate, ugly spray, no artistry in it—and catches Keth'ral mid-lunge. The joints of its forward legs freeze solid in a single heartbeat. The beast's momentum carries it another three feet before its frozen limbs *shatter* beneath their own weight, and twelve feet of grey-green muscle crashes onto the reed-mat platform with a sound like a building collapsing.\n\nThe rider launches herself clear.\n\nThe woman hits the platform rolling, comes up with her bone-knife drawn, and I'm already there—Whisperwind descending in an arc. She gets the knife up. The corrupted blade bites through bone and leather and finds the meat of her shoulder, not deep, not killing, but *enough*.\n\nShe screams.\n\nWhisperwind punches through her throat before she can get the knife back up. She dies staring at me, predator-contempt frozen on her face, and I have to *twist* the blade to free it from the cage of her vertebrae.\n\nWhen I straighten, the platform has gone silent except for the crackle of dying flames and my own ragged breathing.\n\nThe Chieftain rises from his bone-throne.\n\nHe moves with the languid grace of a man who has watched most of his warband die and feels nothing but mild inconvenience. The obsidian greatsword comes off his back in a single fluid motion—five feet of volcanic glass that catches the firelight and *drinks* it, the edge so sharp it seems to cut the very air. The blade is older than this tribe. Older than the marshes themselves. I can feel the weight of its history from fifteen feet away.\n\n\"Kareth-Suul,\" he says, placing a massive hand over his chest. \"So you know the name of the one who ends you.\"\n\nHe's *huge* up close. Six and a half feet of sun-darkened muscle carved with scars that have been packed with ash until they shine like rivers of bone against bronze. His hair-ridge stands stiff with rendered fat and red ochre, finger-bones braided into the crest from warriors he's killed. His eyes are the color of old amber, and they haven't left mine since he stood.\n\n\"You've earned this death,\" he continues, rolling his massive shoulders. \"I'll make it quick.\"\n\n\"Or.\" I have to force the word out through a throat gone dry. \"Or we could discuss where you might *actually* want to migrate.\"\n\nHe laughs.\n\n\"The fuck-doll thinks to *negotiate*? After painting my platform with the blood of my warriors?\" He gestures at the carnage around us—the bodies, the dying drake, the fire-scarred reed-mat. \"You've killed nine of my people, pale-meat. *Vash'ti* who's ridden beside me for twelve seasons. My *brother's son*.\"\n\nHe points the obsidian blade at me. The tip doesn't waver.\n\n[Image: 'Spread those pale thighs and let me plant marsh-seed in your belly.'\n\"There is only one negotiation left.\"\n\nMy grip tightens on Whisperwind. \"Name it.\"\n\n\"Spread those pale thighs and let me plant marsh-seed in your belly.\" His amber eyes travel down my body—the chain-scale bikini soaked with blood and sweat, my massive breasts heaving with each breath, the metal thong that's ridden so far up my pussy lips that I'm essentially bare. \"One breeding. One planting. A mark of *respect* for a worthy opponent. Then you may limp back to your green-filth master, and I will lead my people wherever you suggest.\"\n\nThe collar *purrs* against my throat.\n\n*Take it*, it seems to whisper. *Take the easy way. Let him mount you. Let him rut. What's one more violation?*\n\nI think of Elara.\n\nI think of Snib's hut, and what's probably happening there right now while I'm bleeding on this platform.\n\nI think of the days left, and how I'll never make it through them if I start surrendering now.]The drake *explodes* forward.\n\nSix legs move in a wave-pattern that eats distance like fire eats tinder, twelve feet of grey-green muscle flowing across the blood-slicked platform faster than any horse could manage. I throw myself sideways, spike heels scraping against reed-mat, and the beast's jaws snap shut on the space where my throat was a heartbeat ago. The sound of those interlocking teeth meeting is like a portcullis slamming home.\n\n\"Glacieshold!\"\n\nIce sprays from my good hand—a desperate, ugly smear, no precision left in it. It catches the drake's flank and *spreads*, crystallizing across scales, but the beast doesn't slow. Doesn't even seem to *notice*. The ice shatters against the flex of muscle beneath, and then Vash'ti is bringing that ten-foot bone lance around in an arc that would take my head from my shoulders.\n\nI duck. The lance-tip passes through the space where my skull was. My riposte is pure instinct—Whisperwind coming up in a thrust at her exposed ribs—\n\nBut the drake *pivots*.\n\nSix legs give it leverage no horse could match. The beast's hindquarters swing around like a battering ram, and I have to abort my attack to avoid being crushed. The motion takes me off-balance. These thrakking *heels*—\n\nVash'ti's lance comes back around, at my legs.\n\nI jump. Wind-magic gives me lift, carries me over the sweeping shaft in a tumbling arc that makes my tits *whip* around hard enough to blur my vision. I land badly, one ankle turning, and the drake is already *there*, jaws gaping, breath washing over me like rotting meat and something chemical that makes the paralytic in my shoulder *burn*—\n\n\"*Ignisurge!*\"\n\nFire blooms between us. The drake *screams*—that metal-tearing sound—and recoils from the flames, its forward eyes streaming. Vash'ti curses in Sandwalker tongue, fighting to control her mount, and I have maybe two heartbeats to—\n\n\"*Keth'ral. Still.*\"\n\nThe drake freezes. Mid-recoil. Mid-scream. Like someone carved it from stone.\n\nBut then it moves. *Up*.\n\nIts forelegs catch a hanging bone-trophy and *pull*, launching beast and rider into the canopy of dead branches above the platform. I lose sight of them in the smoke and shadow—hear the scrape of scales on wood, the creak of ancient branches—\n\nShe's *above* me now.\n\nI spin, trying to track the sound, but the marsh-mist and smoke make everything a blur. My left arm hangs useless. My right hand is shaking around Whisperwind's grip. The platform is silent except for the crackle of dying flames and the distant splash of something moving in the black water far below.\n\n*Where—*\n\nNo warning. No sound. Twelve feet of grey-green death plummeting toward me from directly above, jaws spread wide, and Vash'ti's lance aimed at my heart. I throw myself backward—wind magic, the last dregs of it—and the drake crashes into the platform where I stood with force enough to splinter the reed-mat flooring.\n\nThe lance catches my sword-arm.\n\nTen feet of fire-hardened marsh-reed slams into my wrist with enough force to send Whisperwind spinning from nerveless fingers. The corrupted blade tumbles through the air, catches firelight as it falls, and vanishes into the gap of the fire-pit with a sound like a lover's sigh.\n\n*No—*\n\nThe drake's tail sweeps my legs out from under me.\n\nI hit the platform *hard*, the impact driving the air from my lungs and sending my massive tits bouncing in opposite directions like sacks of grain thrown from a cart. Before I can roll, before I can *move*, six hundred pounds of scaled muscle is on top of me. The drake's forelimbs pin my shoulders to the reed-mat. Its crocodilian head hovers inches from my face, triple rows of teeth framing a maw that could swallow my skull whole.\n\nIts breath washes over me.\n\n\"*Still*,\" Vash'ti commands, and the beast freezes with its jaws a handspan from my throat.\n\nShe dismounts in a fluid motion, landing beside my pinned body with her lance still in hand.\n\n\"You fight well,\" she says, looking down at me. \"Better than any fuck-hole should. Better than most warriors I've killed.\"\n\nI try to buck against the drake's weight, but my left arm won't respond at all. My right is trapped under one of its massive forelimbs.\n\nHer hand clamps my chin. Tilts my head up.

I land badly, one heel catching, but I'm *behind* him now, and Whisperwind is already moving.\n\nHe catches the blade on his vambrace.\n\nBronze rings against corrupted steel, and the impact *jars* through my arms, makes my teeth clack together. He's wearing armor I didn't notice—scaled bracers that match the drake-leather, designed for exactly this kind of close-quarters deflection.\n\nHis elbow catches me in the chest.\n\nThe blow lands between my breasts and *lifts* me off my feet, sends me tumbling backward across the blood-slicked platform until I fetch up against the bone-throne itself, gasping, my vision filled with sparks.\n\n[Image: right]\n\"You have fire,\" Kareth-Suul says, advancing. \"I must admit.\"\n\nThe obsidian blade rises for another overhead chop.\n\nI roll—*under* the throne, between its bone-strut legs, coming up on the other side with Whisperwind ready.

The bone-struts catch immediately, decades of marsh-dried calcium going up like tinder, and I *kick* the burning structure toward him with every ounce of strength these legs possess.\n\nHe sidesteps. But the burning throne forces him *left*, toward the fire-pit's edge, toward the gap in the platform where flames still lick upward from below.\n\nI'm already moving.\n\nWhisperwind comes in low, at his knee. The corrupted blade bites through swamp-drake leather and finds flesh beneath, opening a gash that makes his leg *buckle*. He roars—the first real sound of pain I've drawn from him—and the obsidian sword sweeps down in a desperate counterstroke.\n\nI'm too close to dodge.\n\nI'm not trying to dodge.\n\nThe volcanic glass *shatters* against Whisperwind's edge, the obsidian fracturing into a spray of razor fragments that slice my arms, my cheeks, the upper slopes of my breasts where they swell above the scale-triangles. Blood wells from a dozen cuts. The pain is everywhere.\n\nBut his sword is *shorter* now.\n\nAnd I'm inside his reach.\n\nThe thrust goes in under his arm, through the gap in his scaled bracers, into the soft meat of his side. Whisperwind bites deep, the corrupted blade *hungry* for his blood—and I feel the moment when the tip scrapes against his spine.\n\nKareth-Suul's amber eyes go wide.\n\n\"Worthy,\" he breathes, blood bubbling at his lips. \"*Worthy*.\"\n\nHe falls.\n\nThe Great Platform is silent except for my own ragged breathing and the crackle of the burning bone-throne. Bodies surround me. The Chieftain of the Kheth-Muur lies at my feet with Whisperwind still buried in his side.\n\nI pull the blade free. Wipe it on his leather wrap.\n\nAnd turn to face the Bone-Seer's platform.[Choice: Approach the Bone-Seer.]The obsidian blade moves like black lightning.\n\nI barely get Whisperwind up in time. The impact *jars* through my arm hard enough to make my teeth clack together, and I feel something in my wrist *give*—not broken, not yet, but close. He's not even trying. I can see it in those amber eyes, in the lazy roll of his massive shoulders as he circles me like a cat with a wounded bird.\n\n\"That dead arm throws off your balance. And you're out of fire-words, it seems,\" he observes.\n\nI lunge.\n\nAldric's signature opening—fast, direct, the point driving toward his throat. Seventeen years of muscle memory compressed into a single thrust that's ended a hundred fights before they properly began.\n\nHe *catches* the blade.\n\nNot on the edge—on the flat, his calloused palm slapping against corrupted steel with enough force to stop my thrust dead. Blood wells between his fingers where the edge bit in. He doesn't flinch. Doesn't even blink.\n\n\"Beautiful steel,\" he says, almost admiringly.\n\nHe *twists*.\n\nThe motion wrenches at my grip, tries to tear Whisperwind from fingers that are already cramping with exhaustion. I yank backward, heels skidding on blood-slicked reed-mat, and barely keep hold—but now he's inside my reach, close enough that I can smell the rendered fat in his hair, the marsh-salt on his skin.\n\nThe obsidian blade rises in a blur of black glass.\n\nI throw myself backward. My spine hits the smoldering remains of his bone-throne, heat searing across bare skin where the chain-mail doesn't cover. Before I can recover, his foot *slams* into my stomach—measured, contemptuous—doubling me over, my breasts swinging forward in their inadequate metal cups, chains jingling with the impact.\n\n\"Such *movement*,\" he breathes. \"Your flesh knows how to dance even better than you.\"\n\nI slash at his extended leg while still bent over. Whisperwind opens a shallow cut across his thigh—blood wells, dark against dark skin—and he doesn't react except to *smile*.\n\nThen he's *behind* me.\n\nI don't know how he moved so fast. I try to turn, to keep him in front of me where I can see him, but my heel catches in a gap in the mat and I stumble forward, going down hard onto one knee.\n\nMy ass *presents* itself to him. The metal thong has ridden completely between my cheeks, leaving both globes completely bare and jiggling from the impact.\n\nHis palm comes down with a *CRACK* that echoes across the platform.\n\n\"Such *generous* offerings you bring to battle.\"[Choice: Attack again!]",

My pussy doesn't clench — it CRUSHES, rings of muscle I've had for days and never felt LOCKING around his shaft in sequence, entrance to depth, squeezing so hard that I feel him THROB inside my grip. Then fluid JETS from around his cock — not a trickle but a SPRAY that hits his abs and splashes back onto both of us, and my tits are bouncing so violently they're SLAPPING my chin and my belly in alternating rhythm while my hair whips across both our faces—\n\n\"PATHETIC!\" He laughs, never stopping his assault. \"One minute inside you and you're already BREAKING!\"\n\n\"I'm—I'm sorry—ELARA I'M SORRY—AAAHHHHH!\"\n\nAnother orgasm crashes through before the first even ends, proving I'm not a warrior anymore, just MEAT wrapped around his cock—]I BITE down on my tongue hard enough to taste copper, using the pain to fight the pleasure building in my core, and for ten seconds—maybe fifteen—I hold it back, my whole body trembling with the effort while he POUNDS up into me—\n\n\"Good!\" He sounds genuinely pleased. \"You've got SPIRIT! But—\"\n\nHe shifts angle, and suddenly his cock is hitting something DEEP, something that makes stars explode behind my eyes—\n\n\"NNNNGGGGAAAAHHHHHH! FUCK FUCK FUCK!\"\n\nThe orgasm DETONATES through me anyway, just delayed, just WORSE for being denied, and I'm GUSHING around him, squirting so hard it actually SPLASHES back against us both—\n\n\"There she is,\" he grins. \"The warrior dies, the woman is BORN!\"\n\nMy ass—gods, my fucking ASS, it's like two water-skins filled past capacity, each cheek its own entity CRASHING down onto his thighs with impacts that send ripples through flesh that feels both mine and NOT mine, each SLAP creating aftershocks that travel up my spine and make my tits swing in crazy figure-eights, and I can FEEL how my ass-meat RESHAPES around his hips, how it MOLDS to him, the flesh GIVING and CONFORMING and ACCEPTING his dominance—\n\n\"OOOOUUUHHH! AAAHH! Please—please I can't—NNNNGHHHAAAA!\"\n\n\"Your cunt is MILKING me,\" he growls, and I feel what he means — my walls are doing something rhythmic and involuntary, rings of muscle firing in sequence from entrance to depth, each one gripping then releasing a half-second before the next one fires, creating a WAVE that travels the full fourteen inches of his shaft. I can feel each ring squeeze individually — feel them learning his shape, memorizing each vein and ridge, molding my virgin channel into a sleeve cut exactly to his specifications. His cock THROBS in response, swelling thicker with each pulse until his heartbeat and my contractions sync into one obscene rhythm—\n\n\"Elara — ELARA —\" I sob her name with the same mouth that's drooling onto his chest, the same tongue that tasted his cum, the same throat that's been screaming in pleasure for the man who BEAT me. My hips SLAM down to meet his thrusts — I can't stop them, can't control them — and each impact drives her name further away. I try to picture her face and instead I feel HIS cock. I try to remember her touch and instead I feel HIS hands spreading my ass. My wife is dissolving inside me, replaced by the shape of this man's fourteen-inch cock carving itself into my memory like a brand into cattle—\n\nHe GRIPS my hair — gathers all of it, that waist-length curtain of black silk, wraps it around his fist like a horse's reins until my scalp SCREAMS. Then he YANKS. My head snaps back, spine arching into a bow, and I feel every strand pull taut from root to tip, feel the tension travel from my scalp down my neck down my SPINE to the small of my back where it meets the arch his cock is forcing me into. My tits thrust toward the bone-moss ceiling, swaying in the grip of gravity, and the angle change makes his cock hit my cervix with each thrust — not gentle taps but PUNCHES that I feel in my TEETH—\n\n\"AAAHHHHFUCKFUCKFUCK! IT'S IN MY—IN MY WOMB—\"\n\n\"That's where it BELONGS!\" His other hand CLAPS my ass so hard the sound echoes across the platform, the flesh RIPPLING outward in waves I can track by feel alone, each wave colliding with the next thrust to create these obscene SPLASH sounds of sweat and sex—\n\nAnd then his whole body goes RIGID beneath me, his cock SWELLING inside my already-stretched channel until I think I might actually TEAR, his balls drawing up tight against my ass—\n\n\"TAKE IT!

The HEAT of it — hotter than his cock, hotter than blood, like someone poured fresh stew directly into my guts. And the VOLUME — I feel it POOL instantly, a heavy warmth spreading through my deepest parts, coating walls that have never felt anything but his cock. My womb ACHES as the pressure builds behind my cervix, his seed seeking entry, DEMANDING entry, and this body — this traitorous, purpose-built breeding body — starts to OPEN for it—\n\n\"NNNNNGGGAAAAAAHHHHHHH!\"\n\nI'm cumming AGAIN, harder this time, my pussy CLAMPING around him in rhythm with his spurts, actually MILKING him, HELPING him pump more of that thick tribal seed into my virgin womb, and I can feel my belly starting to WARM with it, starting to feel FULL—\n\n*SPURT-SPURT-SPLOOOORRRRT!*\n\n\"Yes—YES—drain these fucking balls!\"\n\nI'm panting, GASPING, collapsed forward on his chest with my tits MASHED against his scarred pectorals, his hand still gripping my hair while his softening cock slides out with a wet SCHLLLLORP that makes cum GUSH from my destroyed pussy, and I can feel aftershocks of his orgasm—little spurts that paint my ass-cheeks with hot white streaks—\n\n\"Beautiful,\" he breathes against my ear, and his voice is almost TENDER now. His softening cock shifts inside me and my pussy clenches around it — an involuntary squeeze that makes more cum burble out around his shaft with a wet *GLORP*. My body doesn't want him to leave. My body wants him to stay INSIDE forever.\n\n\"The way your face flushes red as sunset. The way your body GRIPS even when your mind resists.\" His hand releases my hair — strands stick to his fingers, black silk glued with sweat — and strokes down my spine to the small of my back where his cum is leaking out of me in a slow, warm river. \"I can FEEL the warrior in you. She's still fighting even while her cunt begs me to breed her again.\"\n\nHis thumb traces a circle at the base of my spine. My pussy contracts. More cum gushes out.\n\n\"Give me another hour, and that warrior will be silent.\"\n\nI should say something defiant. Should—\n\n[Image: 'GUHHHHHAAAA! FUCK!

FUCK I'M GOING TO DIE!\"\n\nMy face is MASHED into the burlap, my ass HIKED up into the air like a bitch presenting for breeding, and he's SQUATTING behind me, using GRAVITY and his impossible strength to drive down into my destroyed pussy with impacts that make my skull rattle—\n\nHis hand wraps around my THROAT from behind, and the position forces my spine into this obscene arch that makes my ass cheeks spread WIDER, lets him sink DEEPER, and I can feel my own massive tits DRAGGING across the rough burlap beneath me with each thrust, my nipples catching on the weave and sending sparks of pleasure-pain that burn out whatever's left of my thoughts—\n\n\"If you're a WARRIOR—\" *SLAM* \"—if you LOVE your wife—\" *SLAM* \"—DON'T. FUCKING. CUM!\"\n\nBut my ass is CLAPPING together around his cock, each cheek a separate entity of jiggling pale flesh that CRASHES into the other with wet meaty impacts, and the sound is like someone beating a drum made of raw meat, and I can feel every ripple traveling through my body, through my pussy WALLS that are gripping him so tight I think I might actually squeeze him in HALF—\n\n\"NNNNNGGGAAAAHHH! I CAN'T—I CAN'T—\"\n\nThis one just ARRIVES — my pussy remembers what it learned ten minutes ago and skips the foreplay, clenching into that same devastating rhythm immediately, and I feel myself GUSH around him before the word \"cumming\" even forms in my mouth. My body has been TRAINED in a single session.\n\n\"WEAK!\" He sounds PLEASED, genuinely delighted by how fast I broke the second time, and he INCREASES his pace, rutting me into the burlap like I'm nothing but a convenient hole attached to an inconveniently mouthy warrior—\n\nMy eyes roll back so far I can see the inside of my own SKULL, my tongue lolling out, drool mixing with the marsh-humid air, and somewhere in the foggy distance I feel my pussy CLAMP and SPRAY and absolutely SOAK his thrusting cock—\n\n*SPLRRRRRRRRRTTTT!*\n\n[Image: 'HHHHNNNNNGGGGG—!'\n\n\"HHHHNNNNNGGGGG—!\"\n\nMy legs are in the AIR, pointing at the bone-moss ceiling, my toes curling and SPASMING as his full weight settles onto me, pinning me with his massive body while his cock JERKS and THROBS inside my ruined channel—\n\nI can feel it—every SPURT, every thick rope of cum PAINTING my insides, and there's already SO MUCH from before that this new load has nowhere to GO, it SQUELCHES and BURBLES around his shaft, escaping in wet spurts that splatter against my ass and his balls—\n\n\"Nnnngh—haaahh—can't—can't think—\" I'm barely SENSIBLE, my voice a slurred mess, my face a rictus of fucked-out pleasure that Aldric the Great would never recognize—\n\n\"Good,\" he grunts against my ear. \"Good little breeding-hole. Take ALL of it.\"\n\nHis balls PULSE against my taint, emptying themselves into me—*SPURT-SPURT-SPURT*...\n\nHe's LIFTED me — hands hooked under my knees, my full weight supported by his arms and his cock — and my pale, soft body is pressed against his like snow against obsidian. My tits flatten and SPREAD across the scarred plane of his chest, my milk-white flesh against his dark skin, the contrast obscene in the brazier-light. Where he's hard — stone-carved muscle under battle-scarred hide — I'm SOFT, yielding, my body MOLDING to his like wax pressed against a seal. Sweat pools between us, our skin making obscene SQUELCHING sounds as he BOUNCES me on his cock, my hair stuck to his shoulders in wet black ropes—\n\n\"AAAHHHH! OOOOH! PLEASE—PLEASE I CAN'T TAKE—UUUUNNNGGHHH!\"\n\n\"Can ELARA do this?\" He SLAMS me down onto his cock, hilting so deep I swear I can feel him in my CHEST. \"Can your precious WIFE make you squirt like a broken fountain?\"\n\n\"N-no—I mean YES—I mean—FUUUUUUUUUCK!\"\n\nHe CUMS again, and I feel it SPRAY inside me, feel my already-flooded womb OVERFLOW, feel hot cum GUSHING down my thighs and splattering onto the burlap beneath us—\n\nHis mouth finds mine and he KISSES me, deep and claiming, and I feel his filed teeth—those predator fangs—scraping against my lip.\n\nI just MELT into him while his cock throbs and spurts its last offerings into my conquered pussy—\n\nHis cock SLIPS out of me with a wet *SCHLORRRP* that makes us both grunt, and I'm practically SITTING on it now—that massive thing jutting forward between my thighs, still glistening with our combined fluids, somehow starting to TWITCH back to hardness—\n\n\"Look at that.\" He sounds genuinely AMAZED, staring down at his own cock \"YOU. It's you. This fat ass—\" he GRIPS one cheek, \"—these milk-sacks—\" he squeezes a dangling breast, \"—this fucked-out FACE you make—\"\n\nHe LAUGHS, the sound rumbling through his chest against my back.\n\n\"You make me want to fuck ALL NIGHT. Haven't felt like this since I was a young man, taking my first Muratheen.\"\n\nI can feel his cock HARDENING against my thigh, RISING like something resurrected, and some part of me—some deep, shameful part—THRILLS at the knowledge that THIS BODY does this to him—\n\n\"You have EARNED it.\"\n\nHis voice is solemn now, almost ceremonial, even as he FLIPS me onto my back, even as he SPREADS my legs wide and positions himself between them—\n\n\"The Kheth-Muur will depart your master's lands. The Kharath is PAID.\"\n\n\"Th-thank—OOOHHH!\"\n\nHe DRIVES into me before I can finish, and my thanks become a SCREAM of overwhelmed pleasure as his cock BOTTOMS OUT against my cervix, as his massive ballsack SWINGS forward to PUMMEL my ass with each thrust—\n\nThis position—my legs in the air, his full weight behind each stroke—is BRUTAL, the most violent fucking of the night, and my ass RIPPLES with each impact, each cheek separately jiggling in these obscene waves that take a full second to settle before the NEXT thrust sends them flying again—\n\n*SPLAP-SPLAP-SPLAP-SPLAP-SPLAP!*\n\n\"AAAAHHH! NNNNGH! OOOUH! PLEASE! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE—\"\n\n\"This—\" *SLAM* \"—is what you ARE now—\" *SLAM* \"—a hole for BREEDING—\" *SLAM* \"—a vessel for SEED!\"\n\nAnd something about those words—about the TRUTH of them—makes my pussy CLENCH and my eyes roll back and suddenly I'm SQUIRTING again, actually GUSHING around his cock, the spray hitting his abs and splashing back onto my own belly and tits—\n\n\"THERE IT IS!\" He roars with triumph. \"The green-filth doesn't own you—I DO!\"\n\nThe collar at my throat has been SILENT, I realize dimly. Silent since—since when? Since he first entered me? It doesn't seem to MIND what's happening, doesn't seem to CARE that another man is claiming what belongs to Snib-\n\nHis hand GRIPS my hair, YANKS my head up, and his other hand STROKES that massive shaft—once, twice, three times—\n\n\"I love to see a warrior's fire EXTINGUISHED.\" His amber eyes bore into mine. \"It is... SWEET.\"\n\n*SPLOOOOOOORRRRRRRTTTTT!*\n\nThe first rope hits my forehead with actual WEIGHT — I feel my head rock back from the impact, feel the hot line of it land heavy across my brow and slide immediately into my right eye. I try to blink it away but it's too thick, too sticky, gumming my lashes together. Before I can raise a hand, the second rope ENTERS my open mouth — no arc, no warning, just a direct shot that hits the back of my throat and makes me GAG on salt and musk. This tastes like a MAN. A man who just CONQUERED me.\n\n\"GLLLRRRKKK—!\"\n\n[Image: 'I love to see a warrior's fire EXTINGUISHED.'\nHe AIMS for my eyes and HITS them, cum GLUING my lashes together, and I can't SEE anymore but I can FEEL—rope after rope PAINTING my face, my chin, my nose, my cheeks, until I must look like I've been GLAZED like a festival pastry—\n\n\"There.\" His voice is satisfied, almost TENDER. \"I will miss the fire in your eyes.\" His thumb wipes a streak of cum from my cheek, pushes it into my mouth. \"But this... this is how you should END.\"\n\nI can't respond. Can only lie there—blind, cum-drunk, pussy still LEAKING his seed—and feel the last ember of resistance finally, FINALLY go quiet.\n[Choice: You have been claimed.",

My bare feet—somehow still soft as any noblewoman's despite months of walking on reed-mat and bone—find the boundary where black marsh-mud gives way to golden dust. Behind us, the Muraat-Kheth drowns in its own rot. Before us, the desert yawns like the mouth of a god we have not yet learned to worship.\n\nThe baby kicks when I watch the sunrise. She always does — restless at dawn, like her father.\n\nThe collar at my throat has been silent for three moons. Just cold metal, dead as the warriors I butchered on that platform. Sometimes I touch it and wait for Snib's voice, that familiar pulse of command. Nothing comes. He has forgotten me, or found what he truly wanted in the cottage where I left my wife.\n\n*Elara.* The name sits in my chest like a stone. I wonder if she still breathes. I wonder if goblin musk has rewritten her as thoroughly as Kareth-Suul's seed has rewritten me.\n\n\"Here.\" The chieftain's voice rumbles behind me, his massive hand finding the small of my back where the swamp-drake leather rides low on my hips. His palm covers the spiral scarification there—my *muratheen* mark, burned into my flesh by the Bone-Seer when my belly first began to swell. \"The child kicks strong this morning.\"\n\nShe does. My daughter—for the bones have spoken her sex—turns inside me like she's already fighting to be born. My breasts, enormous with their promise of milk, ache beneath the lotus-fiber binding. When I walk, my belly leads me like a compass pointing toward a future I never chose.\n\nAhead, Muraat-Keth casts the bones again. The old woman—ancient when the world was young—reads our path in the scatter of infant fingers across virgin sand. The four warriors who survived my blade flank her, their bronze bodies marked with ash-spirals of mourning for their brothers. They no longer look at me with hunger. I am claimed. To touch the chieftain's woman is to beg for death.\n\nThe women and children form our center. Fifteen mothers without husbands now, seven children without fathers, all because I came to their marsh with my sword and my fire-words and my stubborn refusal to submit. They should hate me. Some do—I see it in the way they avert their eyes. But others... others have brought me water when the morning sickness took me, have shown me how to bind my breasts when they grew too heavy, have whispered the songs their people sing to babies still in the womb.\n\nThe swamp-drakes keen as they drag our bone-sleds into the sand. They will die within the moon—they are creatures of water, not dust. When they fall, we will honor them with knives and appetites, waste nothing, carry them forward in our bodies as we carry all our dead.\n\n\"Take.\" One of the younger women—Sai'li, whose husband I opened from throat to groin—offers me a water-skin. Her eyes hold no accusation, only the flat acceptance of someone who has learned that life is mostly about enduring what cannot be changed. \"The sun will be cruel soon.\"\n\nI drink. The water tastes of leather.\n\nKareth-Suul's hand slides from my back to my belly, cupping the drum-tight flesh where his daughter grows. \"She will rule after me,\" he says, loud enough for the tribe to hear. \"The bones have spoken. A chieftain born of two worlds—marsh-blood and cloud-skin.\"\n\nI think of Whisperwind—lost to me now, somewhere in the blood and smoke of that platform. I think of armor that I will never wear again. I think of Aldric the Great, that ghost of manhood I rarely remember being. All of it feels like stories someone else told me about someone else's life.\n\n\"Walk,\" Kareth-Suul commands, and we walk. The whole tribe, what remains of it, bleeding from marsh to sand with the dawn. We carry mud on our chests—the earth of our ancestors. We speak the names of our dead as we mix it with dust—the earth of our future. Even I speak a name, though it belongs to no ancestor:\n\n\"Elara.\"\n\nThe word disappears into the desert wind.\n\nBy full daylight, the marsh is a green line behind us. My feet burn on sand that will soon become an oven. My daughter kicks and turns, restless in her wet world. The collar sits silent as a scar around my throat.\n\nI am walking away from everything I was. Walking toward what I've become—peace-womb, war-bride, carrier of tomorrow's chieftain.\n\nThe sand shifts beneath us, and we shift with it. The Kheth-Muur are no more. We are something new now, something born from loss and necessity and the violent beauty of survival.\n\nWhen the next dawn comes, we will be a day deeper into the desert. When my daughter comes, she will be born beneath stars that have never looked upon marsh-water. When I die—if I die—they will pack my bones with salt and carry me forward, the pale woman who killed their brothers and birthed their future.\n\nThe sun climbs. We walk. Behind us, the last bone-chimes of our abandoned home sing to emptiness.\n\nI do not look back.",

I could END this. Drive steel through his skull while he's balls-deep in my wife.

Twice.\n\nDies with his cock still spurting weakly, his yellow eyes reflecting nothing.\n\nAnd then Elara starts SCREAMING.\n\nJust SOUND. Raw, animalistic shrieks that tear from her throat as she lies there covered in his blood, her pussy still GAPING from his cock, still TWITCHING with the aftershocks of her orgasm, and she's CLAWING at herself, at her face, at her cunt, trying to GET HIM OFF HER even though he's already gone—\n\n\"ELARA!\"\n\nI drop Whisperwind, drop to my knees beside her, try to grab her wrists before she tears her own skin—\n\n\"GET IT OFF GET IT OFF GET IT OFF—!\"\n\nShe's not even SEEING me. Her eyes are wild, unfocused, pupils blown so wide they're almost black. She keeps SCREAMING, keeps clawing, and there's blood under her nails now—her own blood mixing with his—\n\n\"Elara, STOP—it's me, it's ELISE—he's dead, he's DEAD—\"\n\n\"HIS COCK—IT'S STILL—I CAN STILL FEEL—\"\n\nShe's sobbing and screaming and LAUGHING all at once, her body shaking so hard I can barely hold her, and I realize she's having some kind of breakdown, some FRACTURE of reality where her body still thinks it's being fucked even though he's cooling meat against the wall—\n\nI pull her against me.\n\nPress her face into my chest. Let her SCREAM into my tits while I rock her, while I stroke her blood-matted hair, while I whisper nonsense into the crown of her head:\n\n\"He's dead, love. Dead and gone. Can't hurt you anymore. Can't hurt US anymore. I killed him. Drove the blade through his black heart—\"\n\n\"I CAME!\" She tears away from me, eyes wild. \"I came on his COCK, Elise! I was cumming when you—when the blood—I'm still—my pussy won't stop ACHING for it—\"\n\nShe reaches between her legs, fingers finding her swollen, abused hole, and she SOBS when she feels how OPEN she still is.\n\n\"I know.\" My own voice breaks. \"I know, love. But it wasn't YOU. It was the pheromones, the—the MUSK, it gets in your head, makes you—\"\n\nShe's babbling now, words tumbling over each other. \"He just kept—kept TALKING about his cock, about what he was going to do, and I said NO, said I'd die first, but then—\"\n\n\"Shhh— Elara—\"\n\n\"—and then today he said two thousand gold, and I thought—I thought I could help, thought I could GET US OUT FASTER, so I—\"\n\n\"You don't have to tell—\"\n\n\"—IT REWIRED MY BRAIN!\" She screams it at the ceiling. \"My womb started ACHING! Started BEGGING! I've been WET for twelve hours straight! Even now—even with him DEAD—I can feel my pussy trying to squeeze something that isn't there anymore!\"\n\nShe breaks down completely then, collapsing against me, and we're both crying—huge, ugly sobs that shake our bodies. I'm holding my wife who just got fucked by the creature who enslaved me, she's covered in his blood and her own pussy juice, I'm trapped forever in this obscene body because I killed him without getting him to free me.\n\n\"Look at me,\" I whisper into her hair. \"Elara, love, look at me.\"\n\nShe pulls back. Her face is a RUIN—blood and tears and snot. But her eyes... her eyes are still HERS.\n\n\"I'm stuck like this.\" I gesture at my body. \"Killed him without getting him to free me, and now... now I'm going to be Elise forever.\"\n\n\"How—the collar should have—\"\n\n\"I'll explain everything. But first we need to—\" I look at Snib's corpse. \"We need to get rid of that.\"\n\nShe follows my gaze. Something shifts in her expression—a blankness that could pass for calm if you didn't look at her hands.\n\n\"Burn it,\" she says flatly. \"Burn everything he touched.\"\n\n\"The hut?\"\n\n\"*Especially* the hut.\"\n\nWe work in silence.\n\nI drag Snib's body outside while Elara wraps herself in a blanket, still shaking, still LEAKING—every step makes her wince as her abused pussy throbs. We pile everything that was his onto his corpse: the fur pile that STINKS of him.\n\nWhen I return with the torch, Elara is standing naked beside the pile. She's thrown off the blanket.\n\n\"I want to watch him burn like this,\" she says. \"Want the last thing his corpse sees to be the body he'll never touch again.\"\n\nI hand her the torch.\n\nShe lights him up.\n\nHis cock—still semi-hard in death—is the last thing to catch, and when it does, it burns BRIGHTEST.\n\n\"Fucking goodbye, 'Master' Snib,\" I spit into the flames. \"Hope Storak's fertility hell is just an eternity of cumming with no one to catch it.\"\n\nElara LAUGHS—this broken, hysterical sound that's equal parts relief and madness.\n\n\"We're free,\" she says, watching him burn. \"You're still... still HER, but we're free.\"\n\n\"We are.\"\n\nShe turns to me then. Studies my obscene body in the firelight—the way my tits catch the orange glow, the way my hips flare, the useless beauty of this form.\n\n\"You're my wife now,\" she says. It's not a question.\n\n\"I... I suppose I am.\"\n\n\"Good.\" She steps closer, close enough that I can smell sex and blood on her. \"Because I need—I need to OVERWRITE him. Need to replace every place he touched with someone who actually loves me.\"[Choice: Months later...]Her pussy CONVULSES around him, spraying clear fluid that splatters across the dirt floor in rhythmic GUSHES, her whole body seizing like she's being struck by lightning again and again and AGAIN—\n\n\"*VENTUSFURY!*\"\n\nThe word tears from my throat with all the rage of Aldric the Great. Magic that was once DEAD surges through me like molten steel—the collar sits cold and confused against my throat as wind EXPLODES through the hut, catching Snib mid-thrust and RIPPING him from Elara's cunt with a wet *SCHLORRRRRP* that sends ropes of her cream flying.\n\nHis body SLAMS into the far wall hard enough to crack mud-brick. Before he can even WHEEZE I'm there, Whisperwind singing through air to bury itself an inch from his head, close enough that one pointed ear starts bleeding from the proximity.\n\n\"COLLAR!\" Snib shrieks, yellow eyes bulging with confusion. \"KILL HER! CRUSH HER THROAT! MAKE HER—\"\n\n\"It SLEEPS, you fucking WORM.\" My voice doesn't sound like mine—doesn't sound like Elise's. It sounds like steel being *born*. \"A Bone-Seer quieted it. You have NO power over me right now.\"\n\nHis cock is still hard, still DRIPPING with my wife's juices, bobbing as he scrambles for a hold against the wall. \"That's—that's not—COLLAR, OBEY YER MASTER! STRANGLE THE BITCH!\"\n\nNothing.\n\nThe realization dawns in his yellow eyes—real FEAR, the kind I haven't seen since he first captured me. His warty hands scramble for something, anything—\n\nI grab his throat. These dainty fingers that used to be ALDRIC'S HANDS wrap around his windpipe and SQUEEZE just enough to make him understand.\n\n\"I killed seventeen Sandwalker warriors today,\" I hiss, my face inches from his. \"Cut them down like wheat. Their blood is still under my nails. You think one goblin rapist is going to be DIFFICULT for me?\"\n\n\"Can't—HRUK—can't kill me!\" He gasps, hands clawing at my grip. \"Ye NEED me! Need the WORDS! Won't ever change back without—\"\n\n\"RELEASE ME!\" I press Whisperwind's edge against his balls, feel him go rigid. \"Say the release words. FREE ME. Or I start cutting pieces off until—\"\n\n\"WON'T WORK!\" His broken teeth show in a manic grin despite the blade at his sack. \"Gotta MEAN it! Can't force the words—collar knows! HRUK-HRUK—yer STUCK, titcow! Stuck as—\"\n\nMy grip tightens. The wind magic ebbs, leaving me panting, these massive breasts heaving inside their metal cups. Whisperwind gleams with pale fire at his groin—one twitch and I could make him a eunuch, make him SCREAM the way he's made me scream for weeks—\n\nBut the collar would never accept coerced words.\n\nI *know* this. I feel it in my marrow, the way a swordsman knows when steel will break. The binding was forged by entities that wore stars as crowns. It doesn't care about threats. It reads *intention*.\n\n\"Then we NEGOTIATE,\" I snarl. \"You want your gold? You want to LIVE? Give me terms.\"\n\n\"HRUK!\" He's choking but still *grinning*, that horrible broken-toothed grimace. \"Can't—HRUK—can't THINK when I'm mid-rut! Goblin BRAINS don't work right when the breeding fever's on!\"\n\nHis cock throbs visibly between us—still rock-hard, still glistening with Elara's shame. The smell hits me like a physical blow: his musk, her arousal, the mingled reek of their coupling saturating the air until I can taste it coating my tongue.\n\n\"Elise...\" Elara's voice. Broken. Behind me.\n\nI don't turn. Can't. If I see her right now—splayed on the dirt, cunt gaping and dripping, body still twitching from an orgasm wrung out by THIS creature—I'll kill him anyway. Kill him and damn myself to wear this flesh until the day I die.\n\n\"Let him—\" She hiccups a sob. \"Let him *finish*. Please. He said—said after, he'd—\"\n\n\"*Elara.*\"\n\n\"I know how it SOUNDS!\" Her voice cracks into something raw. \"But he's right—he CAN'T think when he's—when the rut is—I've SEEN it! He just keeps GOING until—\"\n\nSnib's warty hand CRACKS across my left breast before I can react.\n\nThe pain is SHOCKING—these grotesque milk-heavy udders have no armor, no protection, just soft flesh that RIPPLES from the impact. My grip loosens for one instant and he SQUIRMS free, cackling.\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK! See? Can't even HOLD a goblin proper!\" He dances backward, cock swinging obscenely. \"Yer a JOKE in that body, hero! All them muscles turned to TITS and ARSE!\"\n\n\"*VENTUSFURY!*\"\n\nThe wind surges again—but weaker this time. The Bone-Seer's gifts cost SOMETHING, and I've been casting all day. He stumbles but doesn't fall.\n\n\"Magic's FADIN', ain't it?\" His yellow eyes gleam with renewed confidence. \"Here's the DEAL, titcow. Ye let me finish what I started—\" He gestures at Elara with his dripping cock. \"—and THEN we talk terms. Try to stop me, and I'll NEVER release ye. Never say them words. Ye can cut off me cock and balls and STILL be stuck in that meat-suit forever.\"\n\nThe truth of it settles in my chest like swallowed lead.\n\nI could kill him. RIGHT NOW. Whisperwind would part his skull like overripe fruit. The collar sleeps—it couldn't stop me, couldn't strangle me, couldn't end my life the moment his ended.\n\nBut then what?\n\nI'd be *Elise* until I rotted. This body with its obscene curves and treacherous responses. These breasts that bounce when I breathe. This cunt that clenches at smells I should find revolting. I'd return to Eboncrest as a stranger wearing my own wife's grief. I'd watch Elara mourn Aldric while sleeping beside someone she barely recognizes.\n\nAnd there's no *certainty* the silence would hold. The Seer said days, perhaps a week. What if the collar wakes the moment his heart stops? What if I die anyway, choking on cold iron while his corpse cools?\n\n\"Ye've got FIVE heartbeats to decide,\" Snib says, already turning toward Elara. \"Then I'm finishin' me business either way.\"\n\nMy hand trembles on Whisperwind's hilt.\n\nBehind me, I hear Elara shift on the dirt floor. Hear the wet sound of her thighs parting. Hear her voice—my WIFE'S voice—thick with pheromones and shame:\n\n\"Just... let him. Please, Elise. It's only a few more minutes. Then we can talk. Then we can figure this out.\"\n\n*Only a few more minutes.*\n\nAs if time measured in goblin-thrusts means nothing.\n\nAs if I didn't just witness her SCREAMING her release on the cock of the creature who destroyed everything I was.\n\nSnib waddles toward her, that massive green shaft bobbing with each step, and I—",

Then nothing.\n\nElara SCREAMS.\n\nShe scrambles backward on the dirt, her legs refusing to work properly, cum still dripping from her well-fucked pussy as she stares at his corpse with eyes that can't quite focus.\n\n\"Dead—he's DEAD—oh Flux what did you—the smell is FADING—\"\n\nI'm at her side before she can collapse, catching her against my chest—these obscene breasts finally serving a PURPOSE as I cradle her head against them, let her sob into the valley between them while I stroke her autumn hair with hands that still shake from the violence.\n\n\"It's over,\" I whisper, though I know it isn't. Not truly. \"He can't hurt us anymore.\"\n\n\"The things I did—\" Her voice breaks. \"The things I BEGGED him for—Elise, I'm so sorry, I couldn't stop, the smell got in my HEAD and made everything feel—\"\n\n\"Shhh.\" I rock her gently, the way she used to rock me after nightmares. \"You'll be yourself again soon.\"\n\nTogether, we dress her—I find her traveling clothes, help her trembling arms through the sleeves, lace her boots while she stares at nothing. Then, without words, we each take one of Snib's ankles.\n\nWe drag him outside.\n\nThe night air hits clean, cold, free of the rank musk that's saturated everything for so long. Stars wheel overhead, ancient and indifferent to our small tragedy and smaller victory. We haul his corpse past the lean-to where Jarkrond watches with amber eyes, past the well, to the patch of sand where we've been burning refuse.\n\nI heap dried brush around his body. Old wood from the dead olive tree. Scraps of cloth still reeking of his seed. Everything that bears his mark, his stench, his memory.\n\n\"Ignisurge.\"\n\nFire blooms from my palm—another gift the silenced collar cannot stop. It catches the kindling instantly, and within moments Snib's pyre blazes against the darkness, sending sparks spiraling toward stars that witnessed the forging of my prison and now witness the burning of my captor.\n\nI reach for the clasps of this cursed armor. The black scales come off. I stand naked in the firelight, and for the first time since Ironrock Mines, I don't feel ashamed of this body.\n\nI cast the armor onto the flames. It glows, cherry-red then white-hot, scales fusing together into something unrecognizable.\n\n\"You'll be... Elise... forever?\"\n\nElara's voice. She's stopped crying, standing beside me in her simple traveling garb, watching the flames consume the creature who consumed so much of us.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe takes my hand. Her fingers are still sticky with... things I don't want to name. But her grip is STRONG.\n\n\"You're still you,\" she says fiercely. \"I watched you fight today—even from inside, drugged on his stench, I could see Aldric in every swing of that blade. You saved *both* of us.\"\n\n\"I condemned myself—\"\n\n\"You chose me over your own body.\" She turns to face me fully, firelight dancing in her beautiful blue eyes. \"You chose ending him over the chance of freedom. That's the most Aldric thing you could have done.\"\n\nWe stand together, watching Snib's corpse blacken and crack. The smell is indescribable—like burning swamp gas mixed with charred meat. But underneath, something sweeter: the clean smoke of honest wood, the mineral scent of superheated sand.\n\n\"What do we do now?\" Elara asks.\n\nI consider. The collar still circles my throat, silent but present. When its sleep ends—tomorrow, next sennight, next month—what then? Will it seek a new master? Will it simply become inert metal? Will it kill me anyway, fulfilling its ancient purpose even in the absence of the one who held my leash?\n\n\"We go home,\" I say finally.[Choice: Your fate is decided.]I watch Snib waddle back toward Elara, that massive green shaft BOBBING with each step, still glistening with my wife's shame, still ANGRY-hard from being denied his rut. His warty ass flexes as he positions himself over her again, and Elara—my WIFE, my autumn-haired beauty who once refused to even KISS me if I hadn't bathed—parts her thighs wider to receive him, her pink pussy lips already PUFFY and drooling clear ribbons of need.\n\n\"There's a good hero,\" he cackles over his shoulder at me. \"Watch close now, titcow. Watch how a REAL male claims what's his!\"\n\nHe doesn't kneel between her legs like a man would, doesn't even show that basic dignity. He SQUATS over her like a toad preparing to shit, his scrawny green thighs spread wide, that massive breeding-pole pointing straight DOWN at her splayed cunt like a battering ram aimed at castle gates. The position is DEGRADING beyond words.\n\n\"Please—\" Elara whimpers, her voice high and broken, and I can't tell if she's begging him to stop or to HURRY. Her sapphire eyes find mine across the hut, wet with tears and something worse—raw, animal NEED that makes her pupils blow wide. \"Elise, I'm sorry, I tried to resist but his SMELL, three days of it, it gets in your HEAD, makes you want things you shouldn't—\"\n\n\"Shut yer cum-hole, freckle-tits,\" Snib grunts, gripping his cock with both hands to AIM it at her entrance. \"Time fer yer DAILY BREEDIN'.\"\n\nThe head of his cock kisses her pussy lips with a wet SMACK, and they PART for him immediately, like they've been trained, like they recognize their master. Her labia are SWOLLEN, flushed angry-red with arousal, absolutely GLAZED with her own wetness that's been building since—since when? How long has she been lying here WET for him while I was fighting for our freedom?\n\n\"AHHHHHNNNN—!\"\n\nThe sound that rips from Elara's throat is the noise a castle gate makes when it YIELDS—when the hinges finally BUCKLE and something MASSIVE forces its way through. Because even as her mouth shapes that raw animal howl, her hips are LIFTING off the packed dirt floor, her spine ARCHING into a bridge, those beautiful dancer's legs—the same legs she once wrapped around ME on our wedding night—drawing back toward her chest until her knees press against her own modest breasts. The tendons in her inner thighs stand out like lute-strings as she STRAINS herself wider, WIDER, her body performing the ancient geometry of a female PRESENTING herself for insemination by a dominant male, and the dominant male is three feet eight inches of warty green FILTH currently DROPPING his full weight onto her cunt like a mason dropping a cornerstone.\n\n*SCHLORRRRK-GLUPPP.*\n\nThe sound of entry is FILTHY beyond language—a wet, meaty, SUCKING noise like a boot being yanked from deep mud, except REVERSED, except it's twelve inches of crooked goblin cock-meat being SWALLOWED by my wife's married cunt in one savage downward PLUNGE. I watch—Flux DAMN me, I WATCH—as her labia STRETCH around that grey-green girth, those delicate pink inner lips CLINGING to his veiny shaft on every millimetre of penetration like they're trying to KISS it, trying to WELCOME it, her pussy literally MOUTHING his cock as it sinks home. Her flat belly TENTS upward—I can see the SHAPE of him through her skin, that crooked ridge PRESSING against her abdominal wall from the INSIDE, and her whole body JOLTS as he bottoms out against her cervix with a meaty *THUMP* that I feel through the FLOOR.\n\n\"HRRRRK—tight as a FIST, this one—\" Snib's grunt is barely words anymore, just raw breeding-fever vocalization, the sound a stud-hog makes when the sow finally ACCEPTS. His scrawny green thighs are spread wide in a SQUAT over her pelvis, his warty feet planted on either side of her hips, and his ass PUMPS downward with a violence that shouldn't be possible from something so SMALL—\n\n*PLAP.*\n\n*PLAP.*\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP—*\n\nEach downward stroke drives his cock COMPLETELY into her body and his ballsack—fat, hairy, each testicle swollen to the size of a Valarian plum—CRASHES against her upturned asshole with a WET leather-on-stone CRACK that leaves her perineum REDDENING before my eyes. Her ass-cheeks are being POUNDED against the packed earth so hard they RIPPLE on every impact, that sweet peach-shaped rear that I used to cup gently in my palms now being used as a CUSHION for goblin-fucking.\n\n\"HNNGH—HNNGH—HNNGH—\"\n\n\"AH—AH—AH—AH—\"\n\nTheir sounds MERGE. His guttural pig-squeals. Her high broken gasps. The WET percussion of his cock churning her insides into froth. The SLAP-SLAP-SLAP of his balls baptizing her asshole in their sweat. The SQUELCH of displaced fluid SPRAYING from around his shaft on every outstroke—I can SEE it, gods help me, a fine mist of her arousal being PUMPED out of her by the piston-action of his meat, spattering the dirt between her spread thighs in a growing PUDDLE that catches firelight like spilled honey. And beneath all of it, a WETTER sound—deep, internal, BIOLOGICAL—the sound of her cervix being RAMMED open and KISSED shut, RAMMED and KISSED, RAMMED and KISSED.\n\n*GLUCK-SCHLUCK-GLUCK-SCHLUCK-GLUCK—*\n\nMy hand is still on Whisperwind's hilt. I can feel the corrupted steel HUMMING against my palm, feel it WANTING to drink goblin blood, and the collar around my throat is DEAD SILENT—asleep, unknowing, unable to stop me from crossing this room in three steps and driving the blade through his pumping green spine. I could end this creature between one heartbeat and the next.[Choice: But you don't move.]",

That fierce jaw I fell in love with is hanging OPEN, a thin silver strand of drool connecting her lower lip to the dirt beside her head. Her eyes have rolled UPWARD until only crescents of blue remain beneath fluttering copper lashes. The FLUSH has spread from her cheeks down her throat, across her freckled chest, turning her fair skin BLOTCHY with the unmistakable heat-map of a woman being fucked toward something she cannot control. Her hands are GRIPPING his warty green forearms, and they're not pushing him AWAY.\n\n*Oh, Eon remember me—*\n\nHer pelvis *TILTS* to change the angle, to let him hit DEEPER, and each time their bodies COLLIDE there's a WET *CLOP* of her swollen cunt-lips KISSING the root of his shaft, her pussy literally SUCKING at him, MILKING him, her inner walls doing something that makes his yellow eyes roll back and a SQUEAL rip from his throat that sounds like a pig finding the choicest truffle in the forest.\n\n\"HRRRRK—SQUEEZE me like THAT again—HRRRRK—that's it, WIFEY—yer cunt knows who OWNS it—\"\n\n\"SHUT—AHHH—shut UP and just—HNNNGH—just FINISH—\"\n\nHer voice has no steel left. It's *molten*. Her protest is the shape of words poured from a crucible that has already MELTED, and even as she says *finish* her legs are HOOKING around his scrawny waist, her hips describing CIRCLES around his embedded cock like she's trying to SCREW him deeper, trying to get his cockhead past her cervix and into her WOMB where it can—\n\nI can't breathe. My chest is constricted not by the collar but by my ribs CRACKING open as I watch this beautiful woman, this HERBALIST who grew rosemary on our windowsill and sang hymns to Flux while she STITCHED wounded soldiers, WRITHING on the packed-earth floor of a goblin's hovel with her legs locked around a creature I've killed so many of, her copper hair PLASTERED to her sweating face in dark streaks, her neck CORDED with strain as she throws her head BACK—\n\nThe SMELL is everywhere now. His rut-musk, thick as curdled butter, layered over her cunt-scent which has gone DARK and FERAL, and beneath both a new smell I've never encountered—the chemical stink of COMPATIBILITY, of two organisms whose reproductive systems are speaking a language that doesn't give a SHIT about love or honour or marriage vows sworn beneath Eon's hourglass.\n\n*PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP-PLAP—*\n\n\"HRRRRRRK—gonna NUT—gonna FILL this married CUNT—gonna BREED yer wife's BELLY full of GOBBO-GETS, hero—HRRRRK—and ye're just gonna STAND there and WATCH—\"\n\n\"DON'T—\" Elara's voice CRACKS into a register I've never heard from her. \"DON'T cum inside—you said you'd PULL—AHHHHHH—AHHHHHH FUCK IT'S TOO—\"\n\nHer whole body SEIZES.\n\nI watch it happen in the SLOWEST time I've ever experienced—slower than the Wyrm's death-throes, slower than the moment Whisperwind first sang in my hand. Elara's spine rises off the floor like a drawn longbow. Her toes CURL so hard the joints POP. Her fingers CLAW into his flesh deep enough to draw GREENISH blood. Her mouth OPENS in a silent SCREAM that goes on and on and ON until finally sound CATCHES UP with sensation and she SHRIEKS—\n\n\"CUMMING—OH GODS—CUMMING ON HIS—I CAN'T—ELISE I CAN'T STOP—I'M SO SORRY—I CAN'T— STOP- CUMMING- SO- HARD-\"\n\nAnd I watch her SQUIRT.\n\nA pressurized SPRAY of clear fluid *jets* from around his cock-shaft in rhythmic PULSES, spattering his belly, his balls, the floor, turning the puddle into a FLOOD. Her cunt is CONVULSING around him so hard I can see the RIPPLES through her belly-skin, her internal muscles CLAMPING and RELEASING in visible WAVES that MILK his cock like a hand WRINGING a cloth, and Snib's face goes SLACK.\n\n\"HRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRK—TAKE IT—TAKE ME FUCKIN' SEED—\"\n\nHis balls CLENCH visibly—drawing up TIGHT against his body, the skin going TAUT, and his cock SWELLS inside her so dramatically that her belly-bulge gets THICKER, WIDER, and then I hear it—\n\nThe sound of a wineskin being SQUEEZED until the stopper fails. THICK, CHUNKY, WET—the sound of goblin seed being PUMPED directly into my wife's womb. His hips SLAM down one final time—\n\n—and CUM begins FORCING itself back out around his shaft because there's simply NO MORE ROOM, oozing in yellow-white ROPES down her perineum, pooling in the crack of her ass, DRIPPING from his fat hairy balls in viscous STRANDS that stretch toward the puddle below.\n\n\"HNNGH—HNNGH—HNNGH—\" Each grunt from Snib is another PUMP, another mass of dense gobbo goo forced into her, his balls contracting in visible SPASMS as they EMPTY themselves into my wife's unprotected reproductive system.\n\n*Whisperwind falls from my fingers.*\n\nThe blade hits the dirt with a CLANG that neither of them hear over the wet SQUELCHING. My knees are SHAKING. My whole body is shaking. These massive tits are HEAVING with each ragged breath I take and between my own thighs—between the thighs of the body that used to be ALDRIC THE GREAT—something CLENCHES with such force that I nearly double over, a THROB of unwanted lust so powerful it feels like being STABBED, and I CANNOT admit what just happened inside me while I watched the creature that destroyed my life BREED my wife on a dirt floor.\n\n*SCHLORRRRRRRRRRRP.*\n\nSnib PULLS free.\n\nThe sound is thick, WET, FINAL—like pulling a cork from a barrel that's been fermenting too long. His cock emerges GLISTENING, still half-hard, ROPES of yellowed seed connecting his cockhead to Elara's GAPING cunt in strands that stretch and SAG and finally SNAP as he waddles backward. And then—without his cock to PLUG the hole—\n\nA TIDE of steaming goblin cum FLOODS from between her legs. Thick as porridge, yellowed-white, absolutely REEKING of that concentrated breeding-musk that coats the inside of my nostrils.. It pools beneath her upturned ass in a LAKE of spent seed, steaming gently in the firelight, and Elara just LIES there—legs still spread, copper hair fanned in the dirt, her pussy still TWITCHING with aftershocks that make little SPURTS of cum BLURT out of her with each contraction.\n\nShe looks RUINED. She looks BEAUTIFUL. She looks like a painting of a saint that someone has DEFACED with mud and filth, the original masterwork still visible beneath layers of DESECRATION.\n\nSnib hunches near her. He shakes his softening cock twice—a gesture so CASUAL, so CONTEMPTUOUS that it makes me want to SCREAM—and globlets of mixed fluids SPLATTER across her inner thigh.\n\n[Choice: Then he turns to you.",

My breath is coming in shallow little *pulls*—a sprinter's breathing, except I've been standing still. Standing still while—\n\n\"Gotta say,\" Snib continues, \"nothin' quite like nuttin' in a *real* woman. All warm and grabby on the inside.\" He glances back at Elara, who is—\n\nWho is *standing up.*\n\nShe rises from the dirt floor with a slow, dreaming grace that makes my stomach drop through the earth.

She pushes copper hair from her face with one hand and *steadies herself against the central post* and as she passes Snib—\n\nHer fingers brush his shoulder.\n\n*Absently.* The way you'd touch a piece of furniture you've grown accustomed to navigating around.\n\n\"Now then.\" Snib turns back to me, drying his hands on his loincloth. \"Ye killed the whole Sandwalker tribe today, that right?\"\n\n\"The warriors,\" I whisper. My voice sounds like it belongs to someone drowning.\n\n\"In that body, no less,\" He whistles through his broken teeth. \"With them *udders* floppin' about.\" He shakes his head with what might be genuine admiration. \"Maybe ye really *were* a hero, deep down under all that tit-meat.\"\n\n\"I *am* a hero.\" My fingers are curling and uncurling at my sides, and there's a tremor running through them that has nothing to do with battle-fatigue.\n\n\"Aye, maybe.\" He scratches behind one pointed ear. \"Here's the thing, though.

Down the cinch of my waist.

My hands fly to my face and I sob into them, shoulders heaving, these massive breasts lurching and shuddering with each wretched gasp, tears streaming through my fingers and dripping from my chin onto the swell of pale flesh below.\n\n\"I c-can't—I tried so *hard*—\"\n\nSnot runs freely. I sound like every weeping maiden I ever rescued from every tower and dungeon across Valaria, and the recognition of that—the *symmetry*—makes me sob harder.\n\nGentle hands find my face.\n\n\"Shhh.\" Elara kneels before me, her thumbs wiping tears from my cheeks with the same patient care she'd use dressing a wound. \"Shhh, love. It's almost over. You've been so *brave*.\"\n\nI look up at her through blurred eyes. Her face is soft with tenderness, open and warm, and for one breath I'm back in Eboncrest, back in our kitchen, and she's telling me to stop worrying about the harvest tax and just *come to bed—*\n\nShe stands.\n\nHer fingers thread through my hair—gentle, guiding—and she draws my face forward. The inside of her thigh presses against my cheek, warm and sticky, and the smell hits me before I understand what's happening. Something *thick*. Fungal. *Alive.*\n\n\"Drink, love.\" Her voice floats down from above me, dreamy and kind. \"You'll need your strength.\"\n\nHer pussy presses against my mouth.\n\n\"*MMMPH—!*\"\n\nI try to pull back—hands flying to her hips, head jerking—but she holds me *firm*, her fingers tightening in my hair, and in the instant my lips parted to protest, something *thick* oozes between them and coats my tongue.\n\n*Hot.* Dense as rendered tallow. The texture of beeswax left too near a hearth—half-solid, half-liquid, *clinging.* It *crawls* across my palate, finds the gaps between my teeth, seals itself against the roof of my mouth like mortar poured between stones.\n\n\"Shhhh—*shhhh*—don't fight.\" Her hand strokes my hair. \"Just swallow. It makes everything... easier. I promise.\"\n\nI gag. My throat LOCKS. The taste is—\n\nIron. Mushroom-cellar. The bottom of a tidal pool where things *grow* in the dark. And beneath all of it, a taste my jaw recognizes before my mind does—ancient, commanding, the flavor of *shut up and swallow*—and my jaw goes *slack* against my will, makes my throat *open* when it should clench shut.\n\n\"There you go,\" Elara breathes, and I feel her belly tense as she *squeezes*—her inner muscles contracting, pushing out what's been pooled deep inside her.\n\nA thick rope of it slides across my tongue. Clotted. *Chunky.* Like curdled cream strained through cheesecloth—dense little nodules of concentrated seed that break apart and release fresh waves of that *taste*, that annihilating taste that turns my thoughts to warm fog.\n\n\"Every drop I squeeze out,\" she murmurs above me, her voice catching on a sigh as her pussy *clenches* and another glob pushes free, \"is one that can't... *mmm*... can't take root in me.\"\n\nI swallow.\n\n\"Oh,\" Elara sighs. \"*Oh*, there's so much of it still...\"\n\nHer hips roll gently against my face. Each contraction of her inner walls pushes out a different *texture*—thin and watery at first, the overflow, tinged with her own slickness; then thicker ropes that stretch from her opening to my lower lip before *snapping* wetly; and finally the deep stuff, the womb-seed, hot as broth and so dense it sits on my tongue like a stone and has to be *chewed* before my throat will accept it. The clots are almost *gristly*—packed so tight with whatever makes goblin seed goblin seed that they resist my teeth for a moment before bursting like overripe berries, flooding my mouth with a concentrated *potency* that makes my vision swim.\n\n\"You're doing so well, my love.\"\n\n[Image: 'You're doing so well, my love.'\n\nI am *drinking goblin cum from my wife's freshly-bred pussy* and she is *praising* me for it.\n\nThe hut tilts. Steadies. Tilts again. My fingers have forgotten how to make fists—they're just *resting* on her thighs now, thumbs tracing idle circles on her skin the way she traced circles on my palm moments ago. My own scent has thickened around me until I'm *drowning* in it—gone overripe, gone *syrupy*, the green pear curdled to bruised quince, the jasmine blooming so heavy and indolic that even the reek of goblin seed bends around it.\n\nElara pulls away. A final strand of cloudy fluid stretches between her slit and my lower lip, thinning to gossamer before it breaks. She looks down at me with those blown-dark eyes and smiles the way she smiled on our wedding day.\n\n\"Good girl,\" she whispers.]My hand finds Whisperwind.\n\nThe hilt is warm from lying near the fire, and when my fingers close around it, something in my chest IGNITES—Aldric's rage, Aldric's honour, Aldric's sacred vow to protect Elara from every crawling thing that might soil her, and I am *rising*, I am rising with murder singing through my blood and the blade coming up in an arc that will split that warty skull like a—\n\nElara *steps* into the path of my sword-arm the way she used to step into the path of a draught when I'd left the cottage window open—calmly, as if correcting something I'd forgotten. Her bare chest presses against mine. Her hands find my wrists. Her fingers are still sticky, and the warmth of her skin bleeds through to the bone.\n\n\"Shhhh.\"\n\nOne syllable. The sound she made when I'd wake gasping from the dreams, when the war followed me into sleep and I couldn't tell stone ceiling from dragon-belly. She'd hold my face between her palms and make that sound until the shaking stopped.\n\n\"Shhh, love. Put it down.\"\n\nMy arm trembles. Whisperwind trembles. She's *between* me and Snib, her body a shield of freckled skin and goblin-glazed thighs, and I would have to move her to reach him, would have to *choose* violence against her to achieve violence against him.\n\nThe sword-point dips. Dips further. Touches dirt once more.\n\nHer hands slide from my wrists to my shoulders, and she presses—*gently*, the way you guide a horse's head toward water—and my knees fold beneath me like they've been waiting for permission. The packed earth meets my shins. Whisperwind clatters from my grip.\n\nI'm kneeling.\n\n\"There,\" she whispers. \"That's better.\"\n\nShe's standing over me now, and the firelight catches the slow trail of seed still *leaking* from between her thighs—a thick, yellowed thread that stretches and drops and stretches again, landing on the dirt near my knee. The smell of it rises. Salt-brine and mushroom-dark and something *alive* beneath it all, something that wriggles through my sinuses like smoke filling a sealed room.\n\n\"No—\" My voice comes out strangled. \"No, I can't—Elara, don't—\"\n\n\"Shhh.\" Her fingers card through my black hair, gentle as rainfall. \"Listen to me. Listen.\" She tilts my chin upward until I'm looking at her face—flushed, glassy-eyed, *beautiful* in a way that makes my chest ache. \"Any of his seed I squeeze out now... that you take from me... can't take root. Can't quicken.\" She cups my jaw. \"You'll be *protecting* me.\"\n\nHer hips shift forward.\n\n\"Elara—*please*—\"\n\n\"Just open your mouth, love.\"\n\nHer fingers press against her own lower belly. A slow, deliberate *push*. Her inner muscles CONTRACT—I can see the ripple travel through her abdomen—and her pussy *clenches* and—\n\nA thick rope of goblin seed OOZES from between her flushed lips, heavy as rendered tallow, stretching in a long pendulous strand toward my upturned face. It's *warm* when it hits my lower lip. Warm as forge-water. The taste is IMMEDIATE and CATASTROPHIC—dense brine and copper-tang and beneath that a sweetness like overripe fruit left to ferment in summer heat, and it coats my tongue in a *film* that won't wash away, that SINKS into the soft tissue beneath my tongue and begins to *work*.\n\n\"*MMFH*—\" I try to pull back. My hands fly to her hips but they don't PUSH. They just... rest there. Trembling.\n\n\"Shhh. Shhh. Good girl. *Swallow.*\"\n\nI do.\n\nThe seed slides down my throat like warm honey poured through a keyhole—thick enough that I feel it the entire way down, feel it *coating* everything it touches, and something in my skull goes SOFT. Like parchment left in rain, like mortar between stones that's been slowly, patiently dissolved by root-water seeping through cracks too small to see.\n\nShe sighs. A long, shuddering exhalation of *relief*, as though voiding herself of his seed brings its own dark pleasure. Her hand strokes my hair.\n\n\"There. See? Not so terrible.\"\n\nShe squeezes again. Her abdominal wall *flexes*.\n\nThis time it's thicker—clotted, curdled, the consistency of cream left overnight in a cold cellar. It GLOBS onto my tongue in a heavy mass that I have to *work* with my jaw, have to press against my palate to break apart, and when I do the taste INTENSIFIES tenfold—each clot releasing concentrated goblin musk that soaks through my gums, my cheeks, finds the blood-vessels beneath the thin skin and ENTERS my bloodstream like ink dropped into clear water, spreading, spreading, turning every clear thought *cloudy*.\n\n\"HRRK.\" Snib's grunt from across the hut. Watching.\n\n\"That's it,\" Elara murmurs above me, her thumb tracing my cheekbone. \"That's my brave hero. You can take it. You can take anything.\"\n\n*Sigh.* She bears down again—\n\n—and a final *gush* of thinner, warmer fluid floods my mouth, carrying with it the last clinging strands of his seed mixed with her own slick, and I *drink*, I drink because my throat won't stop swallowing, won't stop *pulling* it down, and each mouthful pours more of that smoke-in-a-sealed-room warmth through my limbs until my fingers are tingling, until my nipples *throb* against the scale-cups with a ferocity that makes me whimper against her mound.\n\n[Image: 'You're doing so well, my love.'\n\nShe looks down at me. Pushes my hair from my face.\n\n\"Good. You're doing so well.\"[Choice: Then she crawls back to Snib.",

Six inches. Eight. Ten. Still growing, still filling, her jaw stretching wider as his girth increases, and the sound she's making around his cock is a *hum*—a low, continuous, *contented* hum, like a woman warming herself by a fire on a cold night.\n\nI'm trembling.\n\nMy hands move to the clasps of my scale-armour. I don't tell them to. They just *go*—finding the catches at my shoulders, my ribs, my hips—and the black scales fall away piece by piece, each one hitting dirt with a small *clink* that sounds like a coin being counted.\n\n*Clink.* The left cup falls. My breast DROPS free, the sudden weight of it pulling my whole torso forward.\n\n*Clink.* The right cup. Both of them now, hanging heavy and pale in the firelight, nipples so swollen they look bruised.\n\n*Clink.* The thong-piece. And the night air kisses the slickness between my thighs—*rivers* of it, running down my inner legs, dripping from me in a steady *pat-pat-pat* onto the dirt floor that I cannot deny, cannot explain away, cannot blame on anything but what I am.\n\nSnib's eyes open. His gaze travels over my naked body with the slow, satisfied hunger of a man surveying a banquet laid out in his honour.\n\n\"*There* she is,\" he breathes. \"There's me hero.\"\n\nHis cock stands at full mast now, twelve inches of angry green flesh glistening with my wife's spit, twitching with each beat of his foul little heart.\n\nElara sits back on her heels and looks at me over her shoulder. Her lips are swollen. Her chin is wet.\n\n\"It'll be over soon,\" she says softly. \"And then we go home.\"[Choice: He approaches you.",

The gossamer fabric transforms morning light into something softer, painting our bedroom in honey-gold patterns that shift across tangled sheets.\n\nElara's tongue circles my nipple *again*, making me squeal into the pillow.\n\n\"You're—*AHHHN*—you're going to make me scream and wake the whole—\"\n\nShe bites down gently and my back ARCHES, these obscene tits that once horrified me now pressing desperately into her mouth. Six months since Snib died. Six months of learning that this body—this LEWD, hypersexual form—can bring pleasure instead of shame when touched by someone who loves me.\n\n\"The baker's wife already thinks we're possessed by succubi,\" she murmurs against my skin, autumn hair spilling across my chest like silk. \"Might as well give her a show.\"\n\n[Image: Her hand slides down my belly—gently, no longer trying to find abs that will never return.\nHer hand slides down my belly—gently, no longer trying to find abs that will never return—and finds the perpetual smoothness between my thighs. Another thing the collar left permanent: hairless as a maiden fresh from temple school, no matter how many months pass.\n\n\"Meanwhile I'm growing a whole FOREST down here,\" she teases, fingers tracing patterns that make my thighs clench. \"You're helping me trim later.\"\n\n\"With the—*THRACK*—with the razor?\"\n\n\"With your teeth if you keep squirming.\"\n\nShe dips one finger inside me and I'm already SOAKED—another gift from this cursed form - I'm always *desperate*. The scent rises between us immediately: that green pear and night-jasmine the collar designed to drive males mad, but which now makes Elara's pupils blow wide with lust.\n\n\"Gods, you smell like pure sex,\" she breathes, adding another finger, curling them just *so*—\n\nThe door rattles under urgent knocking.\n\n\"FUCK!\" We both freeze, then dissolve into giggles.\n\n\"Lady Elise!\" Captain Giles' voice, carefully formal through the oak. \"The—there's been another sighting at the northern border. The men requested your expertise.\"\n\nElara grins wickedly, fingers still BURIED inside me. \"Tell him you're busy being eaten for breakfast.\"\n\nI slap her shoulder, trying not to moan as she deliberately curls her fingers again. \"I'll—*nnngh*—I'll be right down, Captain!\"\n\n\"We'll wait at the tavern, m'lady. Take your... time.\"\n\nHis footsteps retreat.\n\n\"'Those two at it again,'\" I imitate his voice with a growl.\n\n\"*M'lady,*\" Elara mocks. \"Lady Elise, hero of Eboncrest, who can't even cum quietly—\"\n\nI flip her onto her back with the practiced ease of someone who's done this every morning for months. She laughs as I pin her wrists above her head.\n\n\"You were saying?\"\n\nThat's when I see it properly in the morning light—the gentle swell of her belly, still small enough that cloaks hide it, but unmistakable when she's naked beneath me.\n\n\"Getting harder to flip me,\" she grins, freeing one hand to rest on the bump. \"Your son's making me fat.\"\n\n\"Our son.\" I correct, leaning down to kiss her. \"And you're glorious.\"\n\nIt was the final seed Aldric planted before the collar changed him. The temple priests call it divine providence. I call it the last gift of who I used to be.\n\n\"Mmm, flattery will get you everywhere.\" She's spreading her thighs, revealing copper curls soaked through. \"You still have ten minutes before Giles gets suspicious.\"\n\nI slide down her body, kissing her breasts—fuller now with pregnancy—her ribs, that precious swell of new life. \"I only need five.\"\n\n\"Cocky.\"\n\n\"Let him hear that Aldric the Great got his wife pregnant before becoming Elise the—what do they call me now?\"\n\n\"The Beautiful,\" she says, completely serious. \"Though the smith's apprentice calls you Aldric the Buxom when he thinks I'm not listening.\"\n\nMy tongue finds her center and she GASPS, hands tangling immediately in my long black hair.\n\n\"He's not wrong,\" she manages between pants. \"Your tits are bigger than—*AHHHHH*—than the baker's prize pumpkins—\"\n\nI've always known exactly how she likes it. Quick flicks to warm her up, then long, slow strokes with the flat of my tongue. I pull her hood back just enough to expose that swollen pearl, seal my lips around it and *suck*—\n\n\"ELISE!\"\n\nHer thighs clamp around my head. The cottage walls are thin—everyone on our street just heard that. Good. Let them know these two women bring each other more pleasure than—\n\n\"Inside,\" she begs. \"Need you inside when I—\"\n\nThree fingers slide home and she's so wet they go in like silk. I curl them toward that spot that makes her see the Ephemerals while my tongue circles faster. The scent of her—clean and human and *safe*—mixing with my cursed perfume until our bedroom smells like a brothel.\n\n\"Look at me,\" I demand against her cunt.\n\nThose sapphire eyes lock on mine and I see the moment she tips over. Her whole body goes rigid, back bowing off the bed, and she SCREAMS my new name to the rafters as she soaks my face, my fingers, the sheets beneath us.\n\nI work her through it, gentling as she shudders, until she's pulling me up for kisses again.\n\nFinally, I roll out of bed.\n\nShe watches me dress—the specially-reinforced armor that actually supports these ridiculous tits, the sword belt that sits differently on my obscenely wide hips. The collar still gleams at my throat, dead but permanent, a reminder we've turned into something else.\n\n\"Come back safe,\" she says, like always.\n\n\"When have I ever not?\" I counter, our new ritual.\n\nHer laughter follows me downstairs where I hastily throw on my cloak—the one that makes me look less like a whore and more like a hero.\n\n\"And pick up more of that Dwarven oil on your way home!\"\n\n\"The whole market will know what we use it for!\"\n\n\"Good! Maybe they'll stop trying to court you!\"\n\nShe's standing in front of me again.\n\n\"Come back safe,\" she whispers against my lips. \"Our child needs to meet both mothers.\"\n\n\"Always,\" I promise. \"I always come back to you.\"\n\nI leave her there, morning light catching in her autumn hair, one hand on her swelling belly.\n\nGiles can wait another minute. I turn back, sweep her into my arms, kiss her until we're both breathless.\n\n\"I love you,\" I tell her. \"Wife.\"\n\n\"I love you too,\" she says. \"Wife.\"\n\nAs I finally head to the inn, hips swaying because I've learned to LOVE how this body moves, I hear her call after me:\n\n\"Don't forget—you're trimming my pussy tonight!\"\n\nMrs. Curdsworth drops her washing bucket with a CRASH.",

      "text": "The dirt floor is cold against my palms. Against my knees. Against the tips of my tits where they *hang*—\n\nEon's mercy, the *hanging.*\n\nI have never been able to describe this to myself, not properly. Not in all these weeks. But right now, on all fours, with nothing between my flesh and the ground, I finally understand what I'm carrying. Two points of attachment holding what feels like filled waterskins, except waterskins don't have *nerve endings,* waterskins don't register every shift of cool air as a lick, waterskins don't make you aware of their *underside* where sweat has gathered in a permanent crescent of trapped humidity that smells *ruinously, stupidly* feminine.\n\nThey sway when I breathe. I inhale and they stay, and then they follow, and then they overshoot, and then they come back, and I feel every phase of that pendulum in the muscles between my ribs. When I shift my weight from one hand to the other, the corresponding tit swings across the midline of my body and *meets* the other one—\n\n*Plap.*\n\n—and the collision sends a shudder through me that starts where flesh meets flesh and ripples outward to my shoulders, my belly, the heavy curve of my ass, which hangs behind me in the firelight like—\n\n\"*Oh,*\" Elara breathes. She's kneeling beside me. Her hand rests on my lower back. Her touch is warm. Familiar. The hand that once dressed my wounds after the Basilisk Hunt, that once traced the scar on my shoulder while we lay in our bed in Eboncrest. \"You look...\"\n\nMy knees spread without consulting my brain. The movement makes my inner thighs slide apart on the packed earth, makes the tendons along my groin stretch taut, makes the heavy mass of each buttock shift and *part* just enough that I feel air touch places no air should reach when a monster is in the room. The muscles in my perineum flutter in rapid little contractions, *preparing* for something my mind hasn't agreed to.)\n\n*Yes, Master Snib.* I said those words days ago. Broke a piece of myself off and handed it to him like payment. Scrubbed his cum-rags on my *hands and knees* while he watched my ass. Fed him from my own kill and felt *proud* when he liked the taste—\n\n\"Look at this *hero-arse.*\" His voice arrives from below and behind. From this position—face down, back arched, ass high—he doesn't need to stand on anything to reach me. His breath hits the backs of my thighs first. \"Been starin' at this dump-trolley fer *days.* Watchin' it *wobble.*\"\n\nHis hands land on my hips.\n\nMy jaw falls open.\n\nNot from pain or even shock. This is a reflex wired so deep in this body's architecture that my conscious mind has no say whatsoever. The moment his rough, warty palms settle onto the flare of my hipbones, my mouth just *goes.* Drops. Like the hinge has been cut. And saliva pools under my tongue faster than I can swallow, flooding my mouth with warm wet that I have to gulp down or *drool*, and the sound I make swallowing—\n\n\"Shhh.\" Elara's hand strokes my hair.)\n\n*Just this body,* I had told him on the second day of my curse. Or was it the third? *Just meat responding to stimuli.* I believed it then. Believed I could wall off the THING that lives between my legs from the person who lives behind my eyes. But the wall has holes in it now, and what seeps through tastes of green pear and altar-resin and the iron edge a swordsman knows—\n\n]He slides his cock between my ass cheeks.\n\nThe shaft settles into the cleft of my ass the way a log settles into a cradle, hot and heavy and *alive*, and the weight of it is—\n\nI make a sound.\n\nIt's a *vibration* that starts in my molars and travels down through my jaw and throat and chest, a hum I can't locate or stop, resonating in my ribcage the way Whisperwind used to sing when I struck true. This is my skeleton responding to the heat of a goblin's breeding-shaft resting between the cheeks of my ass like it *belongs* there, like the architecture of my hips and the softness of this flesh were designed specifically to cradle exactly the exact shape of goblin fuckstick.\n\n\"Oh *gods,*\" Elara whispers. Her hand has stopped moving in my hair. She's *staring.* I can feel the quality of her attention change—from tender to fascinated. \"It's... Elise, it's *bigger* than I—up close, it's—\"\n\n\"Heh.\" Snib just *lets* his cock sit there, wedged in the warm channel my ass makes when my back is arched and my knees are spread. I can feel every ridge of him. Every wart-bump on his shaft pressing into the soft inner walls of my cheeks. His balls, those heavy hairy plums, resting against my perineum, their warmth soaking through to places I've never felt warmth before.\n\n\"Just *rest* there for a bit,\" Elara murmurs, and I realize she's talking to *him.* \"Let her get used to the feel of you.\"\n\nThe backs of my knees have gone soft. Like the tendons have been replaced with warm tallow. My elbows tremble. My tits sway with the trembling—that secondary momentum, always half a beat behind, always reminding me they're *there*—and the tips of my nipples brush the dirt floor.\n\nThe sensation of that... this is whole-body lightning that starts at two points of contact (hard nipple on rough earth) and cascades *everywhere.* Through the muscles in my chest. Through my stomach, which clenches like I've been punched. Through my spine, which arches DEEPER without permission, which PRESENTS my ass higher, which makes Snib's cock settle *heavier* between my cheeks.\n\n\"There,\" Elara says softly. \"See? Your body knows.\"\n\nCan't stop my jaw from hanging open, can't stop the saliva, can't stop the hum in my teeth—\n\n*Fishhook.*\n\nThat's the only word for it. Something behind my navel, LOW, where my womb sits in this body I never asked for, pulls *downward* with the insistence of a fish striking a line. A tugging that makes my pelvis tilt, makes my lower back hollow out, makes my cunt—\n\n*Drip.*\n\nThe sound is audible. A single drop of something clear and viscous falling from between my legs onto the packed earth. I watch it from above—I can *see* it, past the hanging curtain of my tits—a glistening strand connecting my body to the ground.)\n\nI remember the first night I touched myself. Fingers circling that swollen nub while his musk filled the hut. The pressure building toward something that would have turned me inside out. I came so hard I *squirted,* clear fluid jetting from a body that was supposed to be *temporary,* supposed to be a prison I'd escape—\n\nHe moves his hips. His cock slides forward through the channel of my ass, the oiled length of him dragging across the bare mound of my sex, and the head of his cock—fat, purple, feverishly *hot*—nudges against the outer lips of my pussy like a traveler knocking at a door.\n\n\"NNNN—\"\n\nThe sound that comes from me would shame a brothel worker. It *starts* as a denial, I *mean* it as a denial, but somewhere between my brain and my mouth the consonant *rots*, melts into vowel, becomes a sound that means the opposite of no in every language that has ever existed in the history of Zaelasia.\n\n\"Oh, *darling,*\" Elara breathes. Her eyes are glistening. She leans close, her lips brushing my ear, and her breath carries the sour-sweet remnant of goblin cock.\n\n[Image: His cockhead rests against my opening.\n\nHis cockhead rests against my opening. It's just *resting*, that grotesque purple knob kissing my pussy lips the way a mouth kisses a mouth, and I can feel my own flesh *responding*—the outer lips swelling to bracket him, the inner lips parting to spread a welcome of slick that coats his glans in clear, shining need.\n\n\"Your skin is so *beautiful* in the firelight,\" Elara says. She traces my spine with one finger. Down, down, over each vertebra, down the hollow of my lower back to where his cock rests against me. Her finger touches the place where his flesh meets mine. Both of us. \"See how you fit together?\"\n\nMy shoulder blades draw together. I feel them—sharp wings beneath soft skin—pulling toward each other, arching my spine further.\n\nThe hair on my forearms rises.\n\n\"I won't tell anyone.\" Elara's voice is a lullaby. \"Not about how you spared our Master. Not about *this.*\" She kisses my temple. \"This stays here. Between us. And then we go home and forget—\"\n\n\"HRRK.\" Snib's hands tighten on my hips. His claws dimple the skin. The head of his cock *flexes* against my opening—I can feel the slit at the tip *gape,* can feel hot precum OOZE from it directly onto my most sensitive flesh, coating the junction where his body touches mine in thick, cloudy slick.\n\n\"Just the *tip,*\" Elara whispers. \"At first. That's all. Just breathe, alright?\")\n\nI try to distance myself from the moment. I remember practicing sword-forms in the desert, trying to find what this flesh could DO. And all along, THIS is what it could do. What it was *made* to do. The hips that threw off my center of gravity—they were built for *this* angle. The thighs that rubbed together—they were built to *spread* like this. The weight that pulls me forward—it was designed to put me in *this* position—\n\n\"Yer *cunt's* tryin' to suck me in.\" Snib's voice is guttural.\n\nI can feel it too. The entrance to my body is *pulsing*—rhythmic contractions of muscle that I cannot control, cannot stop, cannot even slow, each one pulling his cockhead a *fraction* deeper before releasing, then pulling again.\n\n*Pulse.* Deeper by a hair.\n\n*Pulse.* Deeper still.\n\n*Plap.* My tits collide beneath me as my body rocks with the spasms.\n\n\"You're a *natural,*\" Elara breathes, and there's something in her voice—something *awed,* something *broken*—that makes me want to scream and sob and *push back onto him* all at the same time. \"After this, we go home.\"\n\n\"After this,\" Snib echoes, and his grip tightens, and the pressure against my opening *increases,* and every nerve in my body gathers at that single point of contact—\n\n\"After this,\" I whisper, and I don't recognize my own voice.[Choice: He slams home.",

I clamp my teeth together so hard my jaw CREAKS. I squeeze my eyes shut. I dig my fingers into the packed earth until my nails split and I *will* myself to be stone, to be iron, to be the hero who walked into a wyrm's mouth and walked out carrying its heart—\n\n\"HRRRK—SQUEEZE me HARDER then, hero—\" *THWOCK* \"—squeeze me cock like ye SQUEEZED yer precious SWORD—\"\n\n*THWOCK-SPLCK-THWOCK-SPLCK—*\n\n\"I won't b-brr—*nnnNNNH*—\"\n\nHis cock *drags* across something inside me that sends white light searing through my skull. Every muscle in my body locks rigid. My toes curl so hard they POP. My fingers claw trenches in the dirt. I'm holding on by my *fingernails*, by the *memory* of Aldric, by the fading image of who I was before this body, before this collar, before this CREATURE decided to mount me like livestock—\n\n\"I—w-won't—*NNNNGH*—won't—\"\n\n\"Yer sword-arm's good fer GRABBIN' DIRT now!\" *CRACK*—his palm across my ass, and both cheeks CLAP together around his pumping hips. *THWOCK*\n\n\"I WON'—\"\n\nIt hits.\n\n\"*AAAAHHHH—AAAHH—AAHHHHNNNGGHAAAHH—*\"\n\nMy spine arches so violently that the back of my skull nearly touches my own ass. My tits SLAP against the dirt beneath me—heavy, sweat-slicked meat hitting earth with a sound like applause. My pussy CONVULSES around his cock in waves so powerful I can hear the WET CLENCHING, hear my own body *milking* him, SUCKING at his shaft with muscular contractions I couldn't stop if I held a blade to my own throat.\n\n\"She BROKE!\" Elara's voice, high and cracked and *thrilled*. \"Look at her FACE! Her eyes—oh *gods*—she looks just like I—\"\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK—TOLD ye!\" Snib GRABS my hair with both fists and YANKS my head back, forcing my spine into an even deeper arch, and my mouth is just OPEN, drool pouring from my lower lip in a silver rope, tongue lolling, eyes rolled so far back I can feel my own eyelashes scraping my brow-bone. \"Look at THIS, fire-cunt—look at yer *hero-wife* DROOLIN' on me cock!\"\n\nHe doesn't stop fucking me. He fucks me THROUGH the orgasm, his stubby hips SLAMMING down with that same mechanical violence, and each thrust sets off ANOTHER detonation—smaller but sharper, little landmines of pleasure that chain together until I can't tell where one ends and the next begins. My cunt SQUELCHES around him on every stroke, spraying fluid that I can feel running down my thighs, pooling in the creases of my knees, soaking into the earth beneath me.\n\n\"*Ahhh—ahh—hhh—hhhnnng—*\"\n\n\"FUCK HER HARDER!\" Elara.

My *wife*. \"Make her—make her FORGET—oh *gods* I'm—I can't—I'm CUMMING just from WATCHING—\"\n\n\"Gonna fill ye with PUPS!\" Snib's voice has gone guttural, FERAL, the breeding-frenzy stripping away whatever thin veneer of intelligence he pretends to wear. \"To REPLACE the ones ye killed! Ye and yer WIFE—gonna breed ye BOTH till yer BELLIES drag on the GROUND!\"\n\nHis cock FLEXES inside me. I can feel it—the shaft THICKENING, SWELLING, each vein PULSING independently against my inner walls like fat worms writhing beneath his skin. His rhythm stutters—goes ragged—his claws SINK into the meat of my ass hard enough to draw blood—\n\n\"HRRRRRRRRK—TAKE ME SEED, HERO-\"[Choice: Take it.]\"I WON'T BREAK!\"\n\nThe scream rips from me with every scrap of Aldric that remains—raw, furious, a war-cry from a throat that was never built for war-cries, pitched too high and too sweet, cracking on the second word into something that sounds less like defiance and more like a plea.\n\n\"And you're going to LET ME GO! You SWORE on the collar! You—\"\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK!\"\n\nHis laughter is wet and guttural. His fist closes in my hair—YANKS my head back until my spine bows and my tits swing forward and SLAP together beneath me—and his hips ACCELERATE, that crooked green shaft CHURNING my insides with a violence that turns my war-cry into vowels.\n\n\"Won't BREAK, she says!\" *THWOCK.* \"The great HERO!\" *THWOCK.* \"Aldric the—what was it—the GREAT?\" *THWOCK-THWOCK-THWOCK.* \"Only thing GREAT about ye now is how far yer arse-cheeks SPREAD!\"\n\n*I killed the Crimson Wyrm.*\n\nI grab the thought like a rope over a chasm.

She's watching from beside us, her chin resting on her folded arms. \"She's clenching so hard I can see the muscles in her back.\"\n\n\"Tighter than YOU, fire-cunt!\" Snib grunts. \"Hero-hole's been SAVIN' herself fer gobbo cock!\"\n\n*I broke the Basilisk at Thornmarsh.

She's broken—she's just a—a GOBBO-WHORE now—just like ME—\"\n\nHe NUTS into me with angry, jerking thrusts, each one accompanied by a piglike SQUEAL that echoes off the hut's walls. The excess has nowhere to go—it forces itself back out around his shaft in yellowed STRINGS that I can feel sliding down my perineum, dripping from my pussy lips, splattering against my inner thighs in thick warm GLOBS.\n\n\"HRRRK—HRRRK—HRRRRRRRRK—\"\n\nI'm making sounds. Wet, broken, *grateful* sounds. My tongue is still hanging from my open mouth and I'm slobbering onto the dirt floor and my hips are PUSHING BACK against his thrusts, grinding my ass into his pelvis to take him DEEPER, and I can't stop, I *can't stop*—\n\n\"You aren't my HUSBAND!\" Elara's voice cracks into something raw and final. \"You're just another HOLE for him!

The SMELL fills the hut, and every breath I take pours more of it into my skull where it soaks through every thought like oil through cloth until I can't remember what I was trying to hold onto, can't remember why I was FIGHTING, can't remember anything except the FULLNESS and the HEAT and the little green body SLAMMING into me from behind—\n\n\"THAT'S what happens to humie HEROES!\" Snib pulls free with a wet *SCHLORRRRP* and I feel the absence like having my guts ripped out. Cum POURS from me—a thick, audible BLORRRRT followed by a slower ooze that I can feel cooling on my skin. I'm still twitching. Still cumming. Little aftershock spasms that make my whole body JERK and my pussy CLENCH around nothing.\n\nHe waddles around to face me. I'm collapsed in the dirt—face down, ass up, cum-glazed thighs still spread, still TREMBLING, still making those wet broken sounds. He looks down at me with those yellow eyes.\n\n\"All that RESISTANCE.\" He shakes his head, that broken-toothed grin splitting his face. \"Just made ye cum HARDER, didn't it?\"\n\nSomething warm hits my upturned ass.\n\n*Hssssssss—*\n\nHe's PISSING on me.\n\nThe stream is strong and STEADY—hitting the small of my back first, then tracking down the cleft of my ass, pooling in the hollow where his cum is still oozing from my ruined pussy. Warm. ACRID. The ammonia-reek cuts through even the breeding-musk, and I just lie there and TAKE it, face pressed into dirt that's turning to mud beneath my drool, while a three-foot-eight goblin marks me like a fence post.\n\n\"There's a good toilet,\" he says pleasantly. The piss runs down my thighs and mingles with his seed in the puddle spreading beneath me. \"Ye know, hero—I was WORRIED fer a moment there.\" He adjusts his angle, directing the stream across one ass-cheek, then the other. \"Thought maybe ye really WOULDN'T break. Thought maybe all them dragon stories was TRUE.\"\n\n*Hssssssss—*\n\n\"But ye lasted—what? Three MINUTES?\" He cackles. The stream weakens, sputters, stops. He shakes himself off—two drops land on the swell of my left tit where it's compressed against the floor. \"Even yer WIFE lasted longer than that.\"\n\nHe looks at Elara over my steaming, twitching body.\n\n\"Didn't she, fire-cunt?\"\n\nElara is on her knees, her hand still between her legs, her face GLAZED with the same empty expression I know is on my own. She nods slowly.\n\n\"Told ye I'd break her,\" Snib says, and settles onto his haunches with a contented sigh. \"Now then—about them terms.\"\n\nI try to remember what terms. Try to remember why I came here. Try to remember the weight of Whisperwind in my hand, the Bone-Seer's voice, the collar that sleeps against my throat, the plan I had, the *person* I was—\n\n[Image: BLLLOOOORRRRRT.\n\nBut there's cum cooling in my womb and piss drying on my skin and the only thought my waterlogged brain can form is a single word, repeating endlessly, like a prayer to gods who've long since turned away:\n\n*More.*[Choice: The days pass...",

My thighs are GLAZED with his runoff—thick and clotted—and I can feel it cooling on my skin in slow rivulets that track all the way to my knees.\n\nHis cock *softens* inside me. I feel the change—the locked flare of his cockhead DEFLATING, contracting, and then with a wet *schlrrrrp* he slides free, dragging a GUSH of seed with him that SPLURTS across my upturned ass in ropy strings. More of it BLOATS from my gaping cunt in a slow, heavy pour—*glorrrp*—pooling beneath me in a steaming puddle.\n\nAnd I haven't cum.\n\nIt comes out broken and hysterical—this high, breathless GIGGLE that sounds insane even to my own ears, my face still pressed into the dirt, cum still oozing out of me in thick *blurrts* with each exhale.

Seed SPURTS from between my legs with the movement, spattering the ground. \"You lost, you miserable little WORM! You came and I DIDN'T!

The veins SWELL back to prominence, mapping his shaft in angry rivers. The head DARKENS from grey-green to that furious purple.\n\n\"Ye think ONE nut satisfies a gobbo?\" His broken teeth show in a grin that makes my stomach fall through the floor. \"One nut's a WARM-UP!

Just the sound of my own voice making noises I've never made, wet and broken and *grateful—*\n\n\"Nnnuhh—nnnnuhh—*nnnuhhh—*\"\n\n\"She sounds like a sow,\" Elara whispers, and her voice has gone somewhere DARK. \"She sounds like a *breeding sow.*\"\n\n\"That's 'cause she IS one!\" Snib GRUNTS—and his rhythm changes. Goes BRUTAL. His claws dig into the meat of my ass hard enough to draw blood and his scrawny hips PISTON with the mechanical fury of a creature in full breeding-frenzy, each downward stroke accompanied by a grunt that sounds less like pleasure and more like *rage—*\n\n\"GONNA FUCKIN'—HRRRK—BREED YE—HRRRK—GET PREGNANT, YE USELESS CUNT—!\"\n\nHis cock THROBS inside me. I can feel it—not just the thrust but the SHAFT itself swelling, FLEXING, the veins along it engorging until I can feel each one individually pressing against my inner walls. His cock is doing something his brain isn't commanding—it's PREPARING, it's—\n\n\"EVERY GOBBO PUP YE EVER KILLED—\" *THWOCK.* \"—YER GONNA BIRTH THEIR REPLACEMENTS—\" *THWOCK.* \"—OUT OF THIS HERO-HOLE—\" *THWOCK-THWOCK-THWOCK.* \"—YE AND YER WIFE BOTH—!\"\n\nHis ballsack CLENCHES.\n\nI feel it against my pussy lips—those fat hairy plums DRAWING UP tight, the skin going drum-taut, and deep inside me his cock does something that makes me SCREAM—\n\nIt *LOCKS.*\n\nHis cockhead EXPANDS inside my womb—FLATTENS, WIDENS—and suddenly I'm *sealed*, plugged from the inside, his breeding-equipment doing what goblins' diseased evolution designed it to do.\n\n\"HRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGHHHHH—!\"\n\nThe first rope of cum hits the back of my womb like a fist.\n\nSo hot it feels like swallowed fire. And THICK—not liquid, not even paste, but *packed*, clotted MASS that slams against my uterine wall with enough force that I feel the impact in my SPINE. My body JERKS forward—\n\n\"HRRRRK—TAKE IT—TAKE ME FUCKIN' PUPS—!\"\n\nI can feel it *spreading* inside me, coating every surface, filling every fold.\n\nThree-four-five, each pump accompanied by a CLENCH of his balls against my mound, each one injecting a fresh payload of that dense, reeking, pheromone-saturated sludge directly into my unprotected womb, and the stuff doesn't just SIT there—it *works*, it *burrows*, the same potency I tasted from Elara's cunt now being delivered to the SOURCE, flooding through womb-tissue into blood into—\n\nI cum again.\n\nMy entire body goes RIGID—toes CURLED, fingers CLAWING dirt—and I SQUIRT around his locked shaft, clear fluid jetting from me in rhythmic PULSES that splatter the ground beneath us—\n\n\"*YOU BROKE!*\"\n\nElara's voice CUTS through everything. I turn my head—my drool-soaked, dirt-smeared, tongue-lolling head—and see my wife on her knees with her hand BURIED between her legs, her face CONTORTED, tears and something ELSE streaming down her cheeks—\n\n\"You BROKE on his cock! After everything! After all your promises!\" Her voice CRACKS into a register I've never heard—half fury, half orgasm. \"You're not my HUSBAND! Aldric would have DIED first! He would have—\"\n\n*BLORRRT.* Another pump of cum. My womb CLENCHES around it, DRINKS it in—\n\n[Image: BLLLOOOORRRRRT.\n\n\"—he would have BITTEN THROUGH HIS TONGUE before he'd—look at you! DROOLING! Tongue hanging out like a—like a—\"\n\nShe cums. I watch it happen—her thighs CLAMPING around her own hand, her back arching, her mouth falling open in an expression that MIRRORS mine—\n\n\"We're both his WHORES now!\" she SHRIEKS. \"Both his gobbo-BRED WHORES! CUM FOR HIM! CUM FOR YOUR *MASTER!*\"\n\nAnd I do. Elise cums. Elise cums and cums and CUMS, her pussy CONVULSING around locked goblin cock as her womb is PACKED with seed, as her wife screams filth, as the creature on her back GRUNTS and PUMPS and EMPTIES himself into the woman who once killed his kind by the dozen—\n\nEach pump a diminishing return, the LAST dregs being squeezed from balls that have been saving this for WEEKS, for the moment they could empty themselves into a conquered hero's breeding-chamber.\n\nHis cock softens. Contracts. The seal RELEASES.\n\n*SCHLORRRRRRP.*\n\nHe pulls free, and something *leaves* with him—not just his cock but some final structural support that was holding me together, because I COLLAPSE, face-first, ass still raised, and the cum—\n\n—it floods OUT of me. Thick as cold porridge, yellowed-white, STEAMING in the cool air, oozing between my thighs in heavy ropes that stretch and SAG and puddle beneath me. The STENCH fills the hut—the same reek I tasted from Elara's cunt but CONCENTRATED, FRESH from the source, so potent I can feel it in my TEETH.\n\nAnd I'm still cumming.\n\nThe orgasm won't STOP. Even without his cock inside me, my womb keeps SPASMING, keeps CLENCHING on nothing, each contraction BLURTING another glob of his seed from between my twitching lips.\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK!\" Snib climbs off me. I feel his weight leave my back like a siege-tower retreating.\n\n*CRACK.* His palm across my right ass-cheek. *CRACK.* The left.\n\n\"Look at THIS!\" *CRACK.* \"The great HERO!\" *CRACK.* \"Can't stop CUMMIN'!\" *CRACK-CRACK-CRACK.*\n\nEach spank sends my ass-cheeks RIPPLING and triggers ANOTHER aftershock and I ARCH my back and MEWL, this high broken sound that doesn't belong to any warrior who ever lived—\n\n\"Nnnnuhhh—nnnuhh—*please—*\"\n\n\"Please WHAT?\" *CRACK.* \"Please MORE? Please BREED me again?\" *CRACK.* \"Say it proper!\"\n\n\"Nnnn—nnnnn—\"\n\n\"HRUK! She can't even TALK! Fucked the words right out of her!\" He turns. His yellow eyes find Elara, who sits in her own puddle, trembling, glazed. \"Oi, fire-cunt. Watch THIS.\"\n\nI hear the sound before I feel it.\n\nA *hissssss.* Liquid. Warm. Hitting the small of my back in a steady, steaming ARC that fans across my skin and trickles down the crack of my ass to mingle with the cum still oozing from my ruined cunt.\n\nHe's *pissing* on me.\n\nNot rushed. Not angry. LEISURELY. The way a dog marks a post it plans to return to. I can feel the heat of it spreading across my lower back, running in rivulets down my sides, pooling in the hollow of my spine before overflowing. The SMELL—sharp, ammoniac, cutting through even the breeding-reek—fills my nostrils.\n\n\"Always wanted to do that,\" Snib says conversationally, aiming the stream up between my shoulder blades. \"Piss on ye. Mark me PROPERTY.\" The stream moves to my hair. My *hair.* \"Oi, fire-cunt—this one's MINE now. Ye can share the straw pile, but this WOMB—\" He redirects the stream between my legs, directly onto my still-twitching pussy. \"—belongs to SNIB.\"\n\nElara doesn't respond. Just stares at me with those blown-dark eyes.\n\n\"Ye'll both carry me pups,\" Snib continues, shaking the last drops onto my ass. \"Breeding season's just STARTED.\"\n\nI lie there. Face in the dirt. Piss-soaked. Cum-flooded. Still twitching with aftershocks that won't fade. And somewhere in the wreckage of my thoughts, there's something I was supposed to *remember—*\n\nSomething about a... collar? A silence? A *choice* I was meant to make?\n\nThe thought surfaces like a bubble in tar. Hangs there for one moment. I reach for it—\n\nIt pops.\n\n[Image: BLLLOOOORRRRRT.\n\nThere's nothing underneath.[Choice: The days pass...]",

She's flushed from hairline to chest, her pupils blown to black coins, and when she kneels between my trembling thighs and lowers her mouth to my cum-flooded cunt I feel her tongue—warm, desperate, LAPPING at the mess of seed that's still oozing from me.\n\n\"You can do this,\" she whispers against my pussy, and a glob of goblin cum slides from her lower lip back onto my mound. Her eyes find mine—huge, wet, almost FEVERISH. \"You're the strongest person I know. You fought a DRAGON. You can survive—\"\n\nHer tongue drags through the thick cream pooling at my entrance and she SHUDDERS, swallowing, her own hand sliding between HER legs.\n\n\"—one more round,\" she finishes, breathless. \"Just don't break.

His knees pin my thighs apart. His cock, hard again, angry again, SLAPS against my belly with a wet *THWACK* that leaves a smear of old cum and fresh precum across my skin.\n\nHe grabs my jaw. Forces me to look UP.\n\nInto those yellow eyes.\n\n\"Round TWO, hero. Just like I fucked yer wife!\"\n\nHis hips DROP. His cock finds my entrance and PLUNGES home in one savage stroke. I feel him punch through my still-dilated cervix like it isn't even THERE, feel that cock-head re-enter my womb, feel the leftover seed inside me SQUISH and DISPLACED around his shaft—\n\nAnd over his warty shoulder, I see Elara, sprawled on the straw, one hand between her legs, the other pressed to her mouth, staring at me with those desperate sapphire eyes.\n\n*Don't break*, she mouths.[Minigame]",

Each downstroke drives his full weight through his cock and into my womb, and my ass BOUNCES off the packed earth with every impact, my tits LURCHING sideways in opposite directions before CRASHING back together with wet *CLOPS* that keep time with his rutting.\n\n\"HRRRK—HRRRK—HRRRK—\"\n\nI stare straight up into his face. Those yellow eyes, that warty snout, that broken-toothed maw panting goblin breath directly into my nostrils. This close I can count every pore, every bristle of hair on his chin, every crusted fleck of old food in his teeth.\n\n\"Is that- ngh- ALL you've got?\" I snarl up at him, and my voice is WRECKED—hoarse and breathy and dripping with sounds I'd rather die than acknowledge—but the WORDS are mine. \"I've taken DRAGON FIRE across my shield-arm! You think your pathetic little RUNT-COCK is going to—*NNGH*—going to BREAK me?\"\n\nHis eyes NARROW. His claws find my tits—SINK into the soft flesh—and he SQUEEZES until I gasp, then drops his warty mouth onto my left nipple and BITES.\n\n\"AHHH—!\"\n\nNot pain. Worse than pain. His grey tongue lashes across the hardened peak while his teeth hold it prisoner, and the sensation shoots from my nipple to my womb like a bolt-shaft on a taut wire. My back arches OFF the ground—\n\n*SPLCK-SPLCK-SPLCK—*\n\n\"Go ahead!\" I hiss through clenched teeth. \"SUCK them! Gobble my tits like the pathetic little RUNT you are! You'll NEVER—*nnngh*—never make me—\"\n\nHe switches to the right. Latches on with that horrible wet SUCTION, his cheeks hollowing, his tongue doing something VICIOUS to the tip that makes my vision go WHITE at the edges. His cock CHURNS inside my womb, grinding against the back wall in circular motions while his mouth works my nipple with an ANGRY desperation.\n\n\"She's winning,\" Elara breathes from somewhere to my left. Her voice is SHAKING. \"Oh gods, she's actually—*ahhhh*—\" A wet, rhythmic sound. She's touching herself. CUMMING, from watching me get mounted.\n\n\"CUM, you fuck!\" I grab his EARS—those pointed, leathery things—and YANK his face off my tit. Force him to look at me. Green eyes meeting yellow. Hero meeting monster. \"Give me EVERYTHING! Every drop of your rancid goblin SEED! Squirt it into me! I'LL STILL BE HERE WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED!\"\n\n*WHAP-WHAP-WHAP-WHAP—*\n\nHis balls are SPANKING my ass with every thrust now—fat, hairy sacks swinging forward on the downstroke to CRACK against my upturned cheeks, leaving the skin STINGING and raw. The sound fills the hut like applause at my own degradation.\n\n\"HRRRK—SHUT UP—\" His rhythm is getting RAGGED. Losing its mechanical precision. \"—SHUT YER CUM-HOLE—\"\n\n\"What's wrong, MASTER?\" I bare my teeth at him. \"Getting TIRED? Is the big strong gobbo running out of STEAM?\"\n\nHis face CONTORTS. He grabs BOTH my tits—one in each warty fist—and MASHES them together around his face, burying himself in my cleavage, his tongue LAPPING frantically at the sweat pooled between them while his hips JACKHAMMER with renewed fury.\n\n*SPLCK-SPLCK-SPLCK-SPLCK-SPLCK-SPLCK—*\n\n\"AAHHH—AHHHH—\" Elara's cries pierce through the wet percussion. She's on her third orgasm. I can hear her SQUIRTING—that pressurized HISS—while she watches a goblin rut her wife into the dirt.\n\nAnd I'm GROANING. I won't pretend I'm not. Every thrust sends a SHOCKWAVE of pleasure from my stuffed womb through my entire body, makes my toes CURL, makes my fingers DIG into the earth, makes sounds come out of me that would make a dockside whore BLUSH. My cunt is so wet it's FROTHING around his shaft, white foam collecting at the junction where his body meets mine—\n\nBut I DON'T. FUCKING. BREAK.\n\n\"Ye—ye CAN'T—\" His thrusts are STUTTERING now. His balls have drawn up TIGHT. His cock is doing that thing again—SWELLING, HARDENING beyond hard, the veins STANDING out like ship-rigging in a gale. \"—no HUMIE can—\"\n\n\"I faced much WORSE TODAY!\" I grab his FACE. Force those yellow eyes to meet mine. \"You think your COCK is scarier than a Sandwalker war-chief? CUM IN ME, GOBLIN! Fill me up and WATCH ME SMILE!\"\n\n\"GRRRRAAAAAHK—!\"\n\nHis whole body LOCKS. I feel his cock KICK inside my womb—once, twice—and then the FLOOD.\n\nHot. DENSE. Each pulse a massive GLOB of seed slamming against the back of my womb like stones from a catapult. His face is TWISTED in agony-ecstasy, teeth bared, eyes squeezed shut, and I stare up at him through the whole thing with my jaw SET, watching this miserable creature EMPTY himself into the body of the woman who slaughtered his kin—\n\n\"More,\" I whisper. My voice is SHAKING but my eyes are STEADY. \"Is that all? Give me MORE.\"\n\nCum FORCES its way out around his shaft—there's no room left—SQUELCHING between our bodies, running in hot rivers down my ass-cheeks and pooling beneath me. My tits are HEAVING against his face, my nipples leaving wet trails across his warty cheeks. Every nerve in my body is ON FIRE—\n\nBut the wall HOLDS.\n\n*...drip.*\n\nHis thrusts slow. His eyes OPEN. Those yellow irises find mine and I see something I've never seen in them before.\n\n*Fear.*\n\n\"Ye didn't—\" His voice is a RASP. \"—ye fuckin'—how—\"\n\n\"I DIDN'T,\" I confirm, and the grin that splits my face feels like putting on armour.\n\nHis cock is SOFTENING inside me. I can feel it SHRINKING, retreating, losing its war. He scrambles backward—YANKS himself free with a desperate *SCHLORRP*—and my cunt GUSHES his seed in a steaming TORRENT that paints the dirt between us.\n\nHe lands on his haunches three feet away. Panting. His cock hangs limp and WET, still drooling the last threads of his spend. His balls look DEFLATED—wrinkled empty purses that have given everything they had.\n\nAnd I'm lying in a LAKE of goblin cum, my tits heaving, my pussy gaping and LEAKING, my hair matted with sweat and filth—but my green eyes are BLAZING.\n\n\"The deal,\" I say. My voice RINGS through the hut. \"You SWORE on the collar.\"\n\nSnib stares at me.\n\nAcross the hut, Elara is sobbing with relief, her hand still between her legs.\n\nThe fire crackles.\n\nAnd for the first time since the collar closed around my throat, the silence in this room belongs to ME.[Choice: 'Say the words, Snib.']*THWOCK-THWOCK-THWOCK-THWOCK-THWOCK—*\n\nHis yellow eyes bore into mine from six inches above. This close I can see every cracked capillary in those sickly irises, every fleck of crust in his lashes, every broken tooth in his grinning mouth as he DROPS his weight onto me again and again and again.\n\n*THWOCK-SPLCK-THWOCK-SPLCK—*\n\n\"There she is,\" he pants. \"There's me hero. I can see it in yer EYES, sword-cunt—\"\n\n\"NNNNGH—no—NO—\"\n\n*THWOCK.*\n\n\"—yer DONE—\"\n\n*THWOCK.*\n\n\"—yer MINE—\"\n\n*THWOCK-THWOCK-THWOCK—*\n\nIt starts in my toes.\n\nSomething that has been coiling in my marrow for days—since the first night his musk coated my sinuses, since the first morning I woke WET, since the first time my cunt CLENCHED at the sound of his voice. Every denied orgasm, every swallowed moan, every night spent grinding my thighs together while pretending to sleep. All of it. ALL of it. Compressed into a single white-hot KNOT behind my pubic bone that has been waiting, PATIENTLY, for this exact configuration of cock and womb and yellow eyes staring down.\n\n\"—HRRRK—SAY IT—\"\n\n\"I won't—I WON'T—\"\n\nThe knot *explodes.*\n\n\"AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH—!\"\n\nMy back ARCHES off the dirt so hard only my shoulders and heels touch ground. My cunt CLAMPS around his shaft with a force that makes him GRUNT, my womb SEIZING in rolling contractions that MILK his cockhead in rhythmic WAVES. My mouth falls open and my eyes roll up and I can feel my own juices SPRAYING around his shaft, SPLATTERING his balls, soaking the dirt beneath us.\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK—THERE IT IS!\"\n\nSnib spits into my open mouth.\n\nThe glob of goblin saliva lands on my tongue and I SWALLOW it without thinking, my throat working on pure reflex, and the pheromones in his spit hit my bloodstream like a key turning in a lock that's been JAMMED for weeks. Everything that was holding the corruption BACK—every wall, every prayer, every memory of who I was—goes *quiet.*\n\nNot shattered. Not destroyed. Just... snuffed. Like a candle between wet fingers.\n\n\"SHE BROKE!\" Elara *SHRIEKS* from beside us—and the sound that comes out of her isn't horror. It's something rawer. \"Oh GODS she broke—she's CUMMING on your cock—she's—\"\n\nHer hand is between her legs. Pumping. Frantic. Her crystal blue eyes are glazed and streaming tears and she's CUMMING too, cumming from WATCHING, her tits heaving as her whole body shakes.\n\n\"You're not—\" she gasps, her voice cracking into pieces. \"You're not my HUSBAND anymore—you're his fucking—his WHORE—\"\n\n\"GRRRRAAAHK—TAKE IT—TAKE ME SEED, HERO-HOLE—\"\n\nSnib's cock FLEXES inside my womb and I feel him ERUPT. Hot and THICK and ENDLESS, each spurt a separate KICK against the back of my uterus, and this time my body doesn't resist it at all.\n\n\"NNNHH—AHHH—AHHH—AHHHHHH—\"\n\nI'm making sounds. Not words. My legs are WRAPPED around his scrawny green waist. My HEELS are digging into his warty ass, pulling him DEEPER, and I can't stop them, can't stop my hips from GRINDING up against him, can't stop my cunt from SQUEEZING and MILKING and trying to get every last DROP out of those fat churning balls—\n\n\"HRUK—HRUK—HRUK—STILL NUTTIN'—STILL PUMPIN' YER WOMB FULL—\"\n\nI can feel it OVERFLOWING. Thick seed FORCING past his shaft, BLOATING from my stuffed cunt in heavy *BLORRTS* that splatter the ground beneath us. The STENCH fills the hut—fermented and ALIVE—and every breath I take pulls more pheromones into my lungs and each molecule finds a neuron and REWRITES it.\n\n\"Fuck her HARDER—\" Elara moans from the straw, three fingers buried in herself, her voice gone STUPID with arousal. \"Fuck her harder, Snib—RUIN her—she's not—she was never—oh GODS I'm cumming AGAIN—\"\n\n*THWOCK-SPLCK-BLORRRT—*\n\nHe HILTS one final time and I feel his balls CLENCH against my taint and the last SURGE of seed punches into me with enough force to make my belly CRAMP.\n\nThe orgasm doesn't end. It just *changes shape.* Becomes something I live INSIDE. A warm, sticky, pheromone-soaked room with no doors.\n\n*Who was I trying to be?*\n\nThe thought drifts past like smoke.\n\n*There was something. A name. A sword.

UP.\"\n\nI start to MOVE. Up. Down. DRAGGING my tits along his shaft in long, slow strokes that make a *SQUELCH-SCHLCK-SQUELCH* sound as his old cum lubricates the passage. His cockhead pokes free at the top of each stroke, glistening, DROOLING, before being swallowed back into the pale canyon of my breasts.\n\nAnd I look up into his eyes and I let the pheromones IN.\n\nNot fighting them. Not resisting. For the first time since the collar closed around my throat, I OPEN the door and let that chemical fog FLOOD through every corridor of my mind, let it soften every edge, let it turn my thoughts to warm honey, and I use it. I *weaponize* it.\n\n\"You like this?\" My voice comes out THROATY. Wet. A voice I've never used before—the voice this body was DESIGNED to produce, dripping with sex like a comb drips with honey. \"You like these fat humie UDDERS wrapped around your cock? Look at them. LOOK at what you did to a hero of the realm.\"\n\n*SQUELCH-SCHLCK-SQUELCH.*\n\nHis eyes are GLAZING. His hips have started to thrust on their own, tiny involuntary JERKS that push his cock deeper into my tit-pussy.\n\n\"What's the MATTER?\" I snarl down at him. My hair hangs around us both like a black curtain. Cum drips from my chin onto his belly. \"Don't you WANT this? Isn't this what you DREAMED about? The great hero of Eboncrest wrapping her big, fat, STUPID cow-tits around your disgusting green PRICK?\"\n\n\"HRRRK—too FAST—ye're—\" His warty hands are scrabbling at my shoulders, trying to push me away, but his hips keep THRUSTING, his cock keeps SLIDING through the slick valley I've made for it.\n\n\"I've KILLED hundreds of your kind.\" *SQUELCH.* \"Cut them down like WEEDS.\" *SCHLCK.* \"And now their SLAYER is using her own TITS—\" *SQUELCH.* \"—to drain a goblin's balls like a common MILK-MAID at the pail.\"\n\n\"HRRRRK—!\" His head falls back. His cock KICKS between my breasts, that pre-orgasmic SWELLING that I recognize now, that I can FEEL through the soft tissue of my chest.\n\n\"CUM for me, you wretched little creature.\" I press my tits together so tight the flesh goes WHITE. \"This is what you WANTED, isn't it? To see me REDUCED to a pair of cum-catching UDDERS and a sloppy FUCK-HOLE for your disgusting green COCK?\" I drag my tongue across his cockhead as it emerges from my cleavage and the TASTE—rancid, thick, goblin-musk—makes my eyes water and my cunt THROB but I don't STOP.\n\n\"Look at me LICKING it! The dragon-slayer is LICKING goblin cock-cheese off your nasty little PRICK! This is what educated, CIVILIZED human women are FOR, isn't it?

His cock BUCKS—\n\nThe first rope hits me under the chin with enough force to SNAP my head back. SCALDING hot, it drapes across my throat like a molten necklace and immediately begins oozing down into my cleavage.\n\n\"MORE!\" I SQUEEZE his cock with my tits and PUMP. \"Give me MORE!\"\n\nAcross my left cheek. I feel it SLIDING over my cheekbone toward my ear, heavy and clinging, refusing to drip.\n\nBoth eyes. I'm BLIND—thick goblin seed SEALING my lashes shut, coating my brow, DRIPPING from my nose. I open my mouth and a rope lands across my TONGUE and I DON'T GAG. I let it sit there. Let him SEE it.\n\nCum fountains up from between my breasts.

Something is happening inside him—I can SEE it, a battle playing out behind those yellow eyes, his jaw clenching and UNCLENCHING, his warty hands balling into fists.\n\nThe collar HUMS against my throat. Still sleeping—but RESONATING with something deeper, something in the old magic that recognizes an oath being CONTESTED.\n\n\"GRRRK—\" Snib CLUTCHES his own head. \"—shut UP, ye stupid—I don't WANT to—\"\n\n\"You HAVE to,\" I say. \"You swore on the binding.\"\n\n\"GRRRAAAAAHK!\" He THRASHES on the floor—kicks his legs, pounds his fists, his whole body WRITHING like a beetle flipped onto its back. \"I HATE ye!

A PULLING—not painful but IMMENSE—like something being wound back onto a spool. My tits, these massive, hated, cum-covered weights, begin to *flatten*. The tissue COMPRESSES, retracts, drawing inward toward my ribcage like bread dough being kneaded back into the bowl. I feel the fat DISSOLVING—transmuting—becoming something DENSER.\n\n*Muscle.*\n\nIt floods my arms first. The soft flesh HARDENS—biceps SWELLING beneath skin that's tightening, DARKENING from porcelain to sun-weathered bronze. My forearms THICKEN. My hands GROW—fingers lengthening, knuckles widening, calluses ERUPTING on palms that haven't held a blade properly in weeks.\n\n\"Elise—\" Elara gasps, stumbling backward.\n\nMy spine CRACKS. Vertebra by vertebra, LENGTHENING—I'm RISING from the floor, the world shrinking around me as I go from five-foot-three to five-foot-eight to six-foot to SIX-TWO, my shoulders BROADENING like a ship's hull being built rib by rib, my neck thickening, my jaw squaring into the hard angles of a face I KNOW.\n\nMy hips NARROW. The obscene flare CONTRACTS—hipbones drawing inward, the breeding-architecture COLLAPSING like a temple whose purpose has ended. My ass FIRMS—loses its grotesque jiggle, becomes the dense, compact muscle of a man who's spent decades in saddle and stirrup.\n\nScars BLOOM across my skin like old friends returning. The basilisk-burn on my left forearm. The sword-cut across my ribs from the Siege of Coldwall.\n\nAnd between my legs—\n\nMy cock returns.\n\nIt doesn't grow so much as UNFOLD—like a blade being drawn from a sheath, length and weight and PRESENCE reasserting themselves where absence had been. My balls drop into place with a familiar heaviness, and for the first time in days I feel COMPLETE.\n\nSnib sees it happening and *SCREAMS.*\n\nHe scrambles to his feet—SLIPS in the puddle of his own cum—catches himself on the central post and BOLTS for the hide-flap.\n\nI take one step after him.\n\nThe STRIDE. The way the ground ANSWERS my foot. Two hundred and ten pounds of bone and sinew driving FORWARD with the economy of a predator who has remembered what it is. No wobble. No mince. No CLOP-CLOP-CLOP of heels. Just the flat, silent CRUSH of a bare foot belonging to someone who was BUILT to kill things.\n\nThe hide-flap tears aside. The desert night OPENS before me—vast and cold and infinite—and Snib is RUNNING, his little green legs churning sand, his empty balls swinging, his screech cutting through the silence like a rabbit fleeing a hawk.\n\nMy eyes catch something else.\n\nLeaning against the hut's exterior wall—REPAIRED. Elara's work, done while I was away.\n\nI look at the bow. It's shoddy.\n\nI look at Snib's retreating shape, growing smaller against the dunes.\n\nI look back at Elara, who stands in the doorway, naked and cum-streaked and BEAUTIFUL, her hand on the doorframe, her sapphire eyes asking a question she won't speak aloud.",

A *beautiful* thing.\n\nI nock the single arrow.\n\nThe string GROANS as I draw—protesting the pull of muscles it wasn't built to accommodate—and I feel the familiar burn across my shoulders, the tension settling into the groove between my shoulder blades where it has ALWAYS lived, the place where Aldric keeps his calm.\n\nSnib is forty yards out. Fifty. A small green shape scrambling up the face of a dune, sand cascading beneath his feet, his screech thinning to a whistle on the night air.\n\nI breathe in.\n\nGreen pear. Night-jasmine.

      "text": "[Image: The desert forgives nothing, but at dusk it pretends to.\n\nCopper light spills across the Shifting Sands like blood thinned with honey, turning each dune-crest into a blade of amber and each valley into a well of violet shadow. The sky overhead has gone the color of a bruise healing—purples bleeding into yellows bleeding into that thin, desperate green that only exists for eleven minutes between day and death of day. Somewhere east, a hawk rides a thermal in lazy circles, its silhouette black as an inkblot against the fading light.\n\nI watch it from Jarkrond's back and think: *That creature has never been touched by anything it did not choose.*\n\n*\"I'M BREEDING-STOCK!\"*\n\nThe words echo in my skull with every hoofbeat. My own voice. My own mouth shaping syllables no hero should know, screaming them into lotus smoke while strangers pumped their seed into a womb that Aldric never had.\n\n*\"FUCK MY HOLE-MEAT!\"*\n\nI said that. I *performed* it. Cupped my own tits like offerings, spread my thighs wider than any command required, narrated my own ruin with the enthusiasm of a market-crier hawking rotten fish. And the worst part—the part that sits in my chest like a swallowed coal—is that it *worked*. The pragmatism of it. The survival calculus. I chose the path of least resistance and it led straight through my cunt.\n\n*You did what you had to do.*\n\nThe thought tastes like ashes stirred into porridge. Technically nourishing. Impossible to swallow.*Sixty heartbeats.*\n\nThat's how long I lasted. Aldric the Great, Hero of Eboncrest, dragon-slayer, bridge-holder—beaten by a single warrior in less time than it takes to piss. Spanked with a spear-butt while my tits threw my balance. Dumped on my face while they laughed.\n\nAnd then Keth-ral's filed teeth against my ear: *\"Now you're not a warrior anymore.\"*\n\nHe was right. The cock sliding into me sealed what the combat proved. I kissed him back. That's the part I cannot outrun, no matter how fast Jarkrond carries me. His tongue in my mouth and mine rising to meet it, and the moan that came from somewhere so deep it might have been my soul admitting what my body already knew.\n\nBetween my thighs, Jarkrond's spine grinds its steady reminder. Each stride pushes the ridge of his backbone against the thin metal strip covering my sex, and the flesh beneath is so swollen, so *tender* from what was done to it, that even this dull pressure makes me hiss through my teeth. My inner walls ache with a hollowed-out soreness, like a room that held too many guests and now echoes with their absence.\n\nThey're still inside me.\n\nNot the men—they're miles behind, drinking and laughing over the pale tribute-meat who screamed herself hoarse on their breeding platform. But their *leavings*. Despite the stream where I scrubbed until my skin went pink, despite the cold water I forced between my legs until I gagged, there is something *deep* that will not wash. A heaviness low in my belly. A warmth that has no right to linger. The knowledge, certain as sunrise, that twenty-four men's seed is pooled against my cervix right now, and some portion of it has already found what it was looking for.\n\nI press my palm flat against my lower stomach.\n\nNothing feels different. But everything is.\n\nThe hawk wheels overhead, catches something in the sand below—a flash of descent, a puff of dust, gone. Life eating life. The desert's only honest transaction.\n\nJarkrond's ears flick backward. Not at me. At the *scent* of me, which has changed in ways I cannot catalogue but he reads like scripture. His nostrils work constantly now, pulling long draughts of air across whatever receptors map the chemical history of what rode his back into the marsh and what's riding it out. I'm coated in it still—the ghost-residue of lotus smoke trapped in my hair, the musk of a dozen strangers ground into skin that scrubbing only drove deeper, the iron-salt of my own blood from bites that haven't scabbed yet.\n\nAnd underneath all of that, unchanging, the perfume this body generates like a furnace generates heat: green pear and rosewater deepening to night-jasmine, then beeswax warmth cut with oakmoss grief. The fragrance rides me even now—honeyed and skin-hot and *ruinously* feminine—drowning the horse-sweat and the blood and the cum-reek in something so beautiful it makes me want to claw my own throat open.\n\nI smell like a thing designed to be fucked.\n\nI smell like a thing that *was* fucked.\n\nThese are no longer different things.\n\nJarkrond clacks his teeth—that bone-on-bone sound of impatience or satisfaction, I can never tell which—and adjusts his gait. The shift drives his spine harder against my sex and I bite back a sound that would have shamed Aldric beyond recovery. My nipples have stiffened against the scale-triangles. The chain between them sways with his movement, *clink-clink-clink*, tiny bells announcing a procession of one.\n\nThe dunes give way to scrubland. Thorn-brush claws at Jarkrond's flanks. Somewhere ahead, the dead olive tree that marks Snib's territory cuts its familiar silhouette against the darkening sky—a black hand with too many fingers, reaching for stars it will never grasp.\n\n*Home.*\n\nThe word arrives unbidden and I hate it immediately. Snib's hut is not home. Home is a cottage in Eboncrest with window-boxes full of rosemary and a fence I never finished painting and a wife who—\n\n*Elara.*\n\nMy stomach drops through my pelvis.\n\nWhat do I tell her? What *can* I tell her? That I went to negotiate and came back pregnant with marsh-warrior spawn?\n\nSmoke curls from the chimney hole—thin, purposeful smoke, the kind that comes from a well-tended fire rather than Snib's usual smouldering dung-heap. Something is cooking. The smell reaches me before the details do: grain and herb and rendered fat, layered with something green and sharp that I recognize from—\n\n*Elara's rosemary stores.*\n\nShe's been cooking. Really cooking, not the survival gruel we've been subsisting on, but something that required *care*.\n\nJarkrond halts ten paces from the lean-to without being told. His ears snap forward. His stance changes—something looser in his shoulders, something *proprietary* in the way he surveys the territory. He's been gone all day too, and the hut is *his* domain as much as Snib's.\n\nI swing my leg over his back and the dismount is controlled agony—my inner thighs screaming, the swollen flesh between my legs protesting every millimetre of separation from his warm hide. When my spike heels hit packed sand, my knees almost buckle.\n\nI stand there swaying for a moment. The evening wind finds the gaps in my scale-mail and touches places that flinch from contact. My tits drag into their heavy, pendular hang, the chain between them tinkling once as momentum dies. The undersides are slick with hours of trapped sweat.\n\nBehind me, Jarkrond's velvety nose shoves between my asscheeks, warm breath blasting the metal strip bisecting them, and *pushes*. Forward. Toward the hut. A shepherd steering livestock through a gate.\n\n\"*Stop* that,\" I hiss over my shoulder.\n\nHis amber eyes hold mine.\n\nHe shoves again. Harder. My spike heels skid in the sand and I stumble forward three steps before catching myself, my tits lurching with the motion—*FLOP-jiggle-settle*—the lower curves catching the last copper light.\n\nJarkrond *chuffs*.\n\n*Go on. Your pen is waiting.*\n\nI leave him at the lean-to and walk toward the hide-flap on legs that feel borrowed from someone who never learned to use them.\n\nThe hut's interior has changed.\n\nI notice it the moment the hide-flap falls behind me: the air has been *treated*. Elara has hung herb bundles from the ceiling beams, dried lavender and sage and something astringent that cuts through the permanent goblin-reek. The cooking pot sits centred over coals that glow with patient orange intent, and steam rises from it carrying the promise of actual flavour.\n\nThe straw pile has been rebuilt. Fresh straw, thick and golden, not the brown half-rotted bedding we've been sleeping on. Our clothes—mine and Elara's—are folded in a neat stack beside it.\n\nAnd Elara stands at the cooking pot in nothing but her nightgown.\n\nHer autumn hair is *down*. Loose across her shoulders, catching the firelight in ribbons of copper and rust.\n\nSnib lies on his fur pile across the hut, propped against the wall, loincloth riding low on his warty hips. One clawed hand rests on his belly. His yellow eyes are half-lidded, lazy, the satisfaction of an animal that has recently *fed*. The furs beneath him bear a dark spot near his groin—a wet stain, spreading, still fresh enough to glisten.\n\n\"THERE she is!\" His voice is syrup poured over broken glass. \"The CONQUERING HERO returns! Tell us, titcow—how many bone-fuckers did ye SLAY with them enormous fun-bags?\"[Choice: Your eyes are on Elara.",

In exchange for the agreement.\"\n\n\"You *fought*.\" Something fierce moves behind her eyes. \"Of course you did.\"\n\nHer hand closes over mine beneath the bowl's edge.\n\nShe squeezes.\n\nSays nothing else.\n\n\"They wanted his well, but I told them of the Shade Springs in the northern wastes. Hidden in box canyons, quite defensible.\"\n\n[Image: 'Well, while ye were off NEGOTIATIN' with bone-fuckers, me and the missus had ourselves a RIGHT productive day. Didn't we, fire-cunt?'\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK!\" Snib sets down his empty bowl with a clatter. \"What a touching REUNION! The hero-cunt comes home from WAR and the wifey's all PROUD!\" He scratches his balls through his loincloth. \"Well, while ye were off NEGOTIATIN' with bone-fuckers, me and the missus had ourselves a RIGHT productive day. Didn't we, fire-cunt?\"\n\n'*Fire-cunt?*'\n\nElara's hand tightens on mine. \"We managed the household.\"\n\n\"Is THAT what we're callin' it?\" Snib cackles.\n\nA look passes between them—brief as a struck match, unreadable. Elara's face stays neutral. Snib's grin widens to show the black gap where his right canine should be.\n\nThe stew curdles in my stomach.\n\n*Don't ask. Don't ask what happened while you were gone. You don't want to know.*\n\n\"Thank you for the food,\" I say instead.\n\n\"You're welcome.\" Elara's thumb traces a circle on the back of my hand. \"There's more if you want it.\"\n\nI eat until the pot is empty. Until the warmth in my belly almost—*almost*—drowns that deeper heat, the one that doesn't belong to me.\n\nThe straw crackles as we settle onto it. Fresh straw—Elara's doing. Golden and clean and smelling of cut grass instead of rot.\n\n\"SAME RULES!\" Snib calls from his fur pile. \"Naked, both of ye!\"\n\nElara rises and the nightgown comes off in a single motion that turns firelight into liturgy—the fabric skating up the long channel of her spine, catching for a heartbeat on the swell of her hips before she lifts her arms and the whole garment whispers free. Copper hair tumbles down between her shoulder blades. She stands bare in the amber glow and she is *beautiful*—freckled collarbones and candlelight pooling in the hollow of a lower back. The beauty of real things. The kind that never ruined anyone.\n\nShe turns to fold the nightgown and I see it.\n\nThe underside of her left breast. A crescent of small, uneven dents in the freckled skin—purpling already, the marks too widely spaced, too *ragged*, with a gap in the pattern where a tooth should be but isn't.\n\nMy stomach fills with ice water.\n\nElara catches my gaze. Color floods her cheeks and her arm crosses over her chest—casual, too casual—and the marks vanish behind her forearm.\n\nNeither of us speaks.\n\nI strip. My own bruises answer hers in the firelight—the finger-shaped coronets ringing my hips, the bite on my shoulder, all the evidence of *negotiations* that neither of us want to discuss.\n\nShe lies down and opens her arms. I crawl into them and we fit together the way we always have, my forehead finding the warm cup of her throat, her chin resting atop my hair. My tits compress between us, heavy and unwanted. Her legs weave with mine, careful around the raw places.\n\n\"We just have to survive this,\" I whisper.\n\n\"We will.\" Her lips press against my crown.\n\nBut her hand, when it reaches mine, squeezes a beat too late. And there is a distance in the way she holds me that wasn't there before—a thin pane of glass between our skins, invisible, flawless, and utterly impenetrable.\n\nHer fingers smell of lye soap.\n\nSnib's snores begin their rattling percussion. The fire dims to embers. The desert wind whispers across the chimney-hole like breath across the mouth of a bottle.\n\nSleep takes me the way the sea takes a drowning woman—all at once, and completely.[Choice: Hours later...",

      "text": "The straw beside me is cold.\n\nNot warm-from-recent-departure cold. *Dead* cold. The kind that means the body beside me has been gone long enough for the desert to reclaim every degree it left behind.\n\nMy eyes open to darkness.\n\nThe hut breathes its usual chorus—wind through wall-gaps, the ember-tick of dying coals—but underneath that, threaded through it like a wire through wool, something *else*. Something *wet*.\n\n*schlk*\n\nMy heart slams against my sternum.\n\n*schlk... schlk... schlk...*\n\nQuiet. Rhythmic.\n\nI don't move or blink. Just let my pupils widen the way *Aldric's* used to before a night engagement, and the hut's geography resolves from black into gradients of grey.\n\nSnib's fur pile. The far wall. The shapes upon it.\n\nToo many limbs.\n\nHe sits propped against the wall, his warty legs splayed like a toad sunning itself on a rock. The firelight is nearly dead but what remains catches the *wet* of him—the gleaming column rising from his lap, dark as bog-iron, slicked from root to ridge with something that reflects the last amber glow.\n\nAnd between his thighs, on her hands and knees, hair spilling across his legs like poured copper—\n\n*schlk... schlk... schlk...*\n\nElara's head bobs with the patience of a tide. Down. Pause. Up. Down. Pause. Up. Her jaw works at the widest point of each descent, adjusting, *accommodating*, and the sound changes pitch—*glrk* on the downstroke where he's thickest, sliding back to that softer *schlk* as she retreats to the head. Her breathing comes steady through her nose. Measured.\n\nShe's done this before.\n\nThe thought lands in my chest like a crossbow bolt shot at close range.\n\nPure *service*. Her rhythm has the patience of someone who's stopped counting the minutes. Snib's hand rests on the back of her skull with the casual weight of someone touching a favourite chair.\n\nHis cock is *alive* beneath her ministrations. I can see it even in this guttering light—the shaft flexing independent of his body, veins standing out like rigging on a mast, the foreskin bunching and rolling as her lips drag it forward and back. His cumslit gapes at the apex of each stroke, burping a fresh rope of that yellowish-clear *slime* that strings from his cockhead to her lower lip before snapping.\n\nThe *smell* fills the hut like weather. That deep, glandular *funk*, that goblin breeding-reek that bypasses every rational faculty.\n\nElara pulls off with a quiet *pop*. His cockhead emerges glistening—swollen purple-dark, smeared with her spit and his grease.\n\n\"Stop *grunting*,\" she hisses. \"You sound like a pig. You'll wake her.\"\n\n\"Hruk-hruk—can't HELP it, fire-cunt. Ye got a tongue like a thrakkin' *serpent*—\"\n\n\"I'm *serious*. One sound and I stop.\"\n\n\"Nah.\" His voice drops to something oily and sure. \"Ye COULDN'T stop if I paid ye to. Not after what ye *drank* today.\"\n\nA silence. Her hand hasn't left his shaft—I can see her fingers wrapped around the root, the pale knuckles rising and falling in slow pumps, the glint of her wedding ring against a vein thick as a quill.\n\n\"That was a *transaction*,\" she whispers. \"Five hundred gold to drink your disgusting... ugh! Nothing more.\"\n\n\"HRUK! And ye *gulped* it down like ALE, missus! Didn't even gag on the CHUNKS!\"\n\n\"Shut *up*—\"\n\n\"Made ye CUM too, didn't it? Felt them thighs SHAKIN' under the table while me ball-sludge went down yer guzzle—\"\n\n\"I said SHUT—\"\n\nHer mouth descends onto him mid-sentence. The insult drowning in the sound of her lips sealing around his girth—*SCHLRRRP*—and now she's working him *faster*, her head bobbing with sharp, angry motions, her hair flying, and Snib's yellow eyes roll back as his warty toes curl in the furs.\n\n\"Hrrrrk—*thrack*—that's the ANGRY suck—that's me FAVOURITE—\"\n\nShe pulls up just enough to speak around his head, her lips still kissing the ridge: \"You're the most disgusting creature I've ever—\"\n\n\"—ever had in yer MOUTH? Hrrk-hrrk-hrrk—\"\n\n\"—ever *met*. And when this is over I'm going to wash my mouth and forget you ever—\"\n\n\"—ever made ye cum from DRINKIN' me nut? From lettin' me spunk-brew sit on yer tongue while yer pretty blue eyes went all—\"\n\n\"*Fuck* you.\"\n\n\"Tonight ye just SUCK.\"\n\nShe makes a sound—half snarl, half something *else*—and takes him deep. Deeper than before. I watch the column of her neck bulging around his girth, and the sound that comes from her is guttural and *wet*—\n\n*GLRRK—GLRK—GLRK—*\n\n\"HRRK—there she GOES—\" Snib's whisper has gone thick, drugged. His hips shift. \"—remember our little GAME, missus? Ye finish me off without wakin' hero-cunt, ye get to crawl back and sleep with yer precious wifey. Ye get CAUGHT—\"\n\n*GLRK—*\n\n\"—ye sleep HERE. With SNIB. On me FURS.\"\n\n*GLRK—GLRK—*\n\n\"And I'm a CUDDLER, fire-cunt.\"\n\nShe pulls off gasping. A rope of spit and precum connects her chin to his cockhead—stretches, *stretches*, doesn't break. Her voice is ragged, wrecked: \"Just—stop talking and let me *finish* this so I can go back to—\"\n\n\"To yer WIFE? The one what just got BRED by a whole thrakkin' TRIBE?\" His cackle is barely contained. \"Bet she's lyin' over there with their loads still swimmin' in her cum-tank and YE'RE worried about ME bein' too loud—\"\n\nThe words shred something in my chest. *He knows.* Of course he knows—the collar tells him everything. And Elara—does *she* know? Does she know I spread willingly, performed like a trained animal, screamed for *more*?\n\nShe's doing what I did. Servicing a creature she despises because the calculus makes sense. I can't judge her. I *cannot* judge her when my own mouth shaped the words *THANK YOU FOR BREEDING MY WORTHLESS HOLES*.\n\nBut my body doesn't give a SHIT about moral equivalence. My body is *responding*—nipples drawn tight against the straw, a pulse between my thighs that matches the rhythm of her bobbing head. The scent of him has found me across the hut and my cunt has answered with a clench so fierce I feel the *weight* of what's inside me shift.*He knows.* The collar feeds him my shame like a dog being tossed scraps.\n\nAnd Elara—she's *choosing* this. Kneeling voluntarily while I—while I *fought*. While I drew steel and stood my ground and got beaten and held down and taken *anyway*. She didn't even try to resist. She just knelt between his warty legs and opened her mouth and—\n\nBut the rage has a crack in it, and through that crack seeps something worse. Because Keth-ral's tongue was in my mouth and mine rose to meet it. Because I said *please put it back in*. Because the line between force and surrender blurred the moment my body decided it wanted what was being done to it.\n\nMy nipples are rigid against the straw. Between my legs, heat pools like something spilled.\n\n\"—now SUCK, fire-cunt. Them balls ain't gonna drain themselves—\"\n\n*SCHLRP—GLRK—SCHLRP—GLRK—*\n\nHis hand tightens in her hair. Wrapping those copper strands around his knuckles like reins.\n\n\"Gonna give ye a BIG one... been brewin' ALL DAY while ye were cookin' yer fancy STEW... thinkin' about them freckly tits the whole time...\"\n\n\"Jssht *finish*—\" she hisses around him, the words distorted by his girth.\n\nMy hand is between my thighs.",

      "text": "I shut my eyes.\n\nAldric could sleep through a siege. Elise can fake it through this. Slow the breathing. Let the jaw go slack. Dead weight into the straw.\n\nBut ears have no lids.\n\nMy tits are stacked one atop the other—the lower one mashed flat against the bedding, the upper one resting on it like a pale boulder on a shelf. Both nipples point the same direction, toward the far wall, toward *them*, and when the upper one stiffens against something I refuse to name, the whole breast gives a single, fine *judder* that I pray looks like dreaming.\n\n*schlk... schlk... schlk...*\n\n\"Slower,\" Elara breathes. \"You're drooling everywhere.\"\n\n\"Can't help it. Ye make me LEAK, fire-cunt.\"\n\n\"Don't call me—*mmph*.\"\n\nShe takes him back in. The sound *changes*—deeper, wetter, her jaw opening wider for the downstroke.\n\n*glrk... schlk... glrk...*\n\nBetween my thighs, the flesh answers. Still swollen from what the tribe did to me, still tender, still holding the *dregs* of twenty-four men's work deep against my cervix. And now those dregs are warming, thinning, mixing with something my body is producing on its own—a slippery, shameful *seepage* that creeps along my inner thigh and pools against the straw beneath my hip.\n\n\"Hrrrk—ye smell that?\" Snib's whisper cuts through the dark. \"Yer wifey's cunt-perfume just kicked up a notch.\"\n\n\"Sheesh *asweep*.\" Elara's voice, thick around him. \"I checked.\"\n\n\"Keep suckin'.\"\n\n*SCHLRP—glk—SCHLRP—glk—*\n\n\"Hrrrrk—HRRRRK—gettin' close, fire-cunt—balls are CHURNIN'—\"\n\n\"Then *finish*,\" she hisses, and the wet sounds go *frantic*—\n\n*SCHLK-GLRK-SCHLK-GLRK-SCHLK-GLRK—*\n\n\"HRRRRRNNNNGH—TAKE IT—HRRRRK—\"\n\nA sound like a clogged drain clearing. Elara makes a noise I've never heard from her—a wet, desperate *GLRRRK* followed by frantic swallowing, *glp-glp-glp-glp*, and then a *cough*, a sputtering gasp, and Snib *squealing*—not words, just this high piglet shriek of release—\n\n\"HRRREEEEEK—MORE—GLRK—HRRRK—\"\n\nElara *gags*. I hear the sound of something thick hitting skin—*SPLAT*—which means she lost the seal, which means it's on her face now, her chin, dripping onto—\n\n\"HNNNNG—\"\n\n\"*Nnh.*\"\n\nThe sound escapes me. Tiny. A mouse dying in a wall. But the hut is small and the dark is quiet and my tit just *lurched* against its twin hard enough to make the straw crackle and—\n\nSilence.\n\nThen Snib's voice, *dripping* with satisfaction: \"Oi, fire-cunt. I can smell two soaked cunts in this room.\"\n\nElara pulls off him. The *pop* echoes. A long, terrible pause.\n\n\"Elise?\" Her voice is small. Raw. \"Are you—\"\n\nI don't move. Don't breathe.\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK—well NOW.\" Snib's cackle, barely contained. \"A deal's a deal, missus. Ye got CAUGHT. Come sleep on Snib's furs.\"\n\n\"No—*please*—she was asleep, I almost had—\"\n\n\"Almost don't count fer SHIT. Move that freckly arse over here.\"\n\n\"Elise.\" Elara's voice has cracked open now. \"Elise, I know you're—I can see your *breathing*—\"\n\nShe's beside me. I can feel her heat, smell Snib's reek pouring off her mouth, and underneath it something *thicker*—that yellowish goblin nut-slime coating her tongue, her teeth, sliding down her throat into her stomach.\n\n\"I'm *sorry*.\" A whisper pressed against my hair. Her lips are wet. \"I had to—the deal was—five hundred gold if I could finish without waking you, and I almost—\"\n\n\"And ye *DIDN'T*.\" Snib's voice, final as a latch dropping.\n\n\"Are you really going to just *lie there*?\" Elara's whisper goes sharp. Aimed at me. \"Touching yourself while I—while he was—I can see your *hand*, Elise. I can see where it *is*.\"\n\nMy fingers are slick. Pressed against my own cunt. I didn't tell them to go there. They went.\n\n\"At least I was trying to *earn* something for us.\" Her voice is shaking. Not with tears. With the fury of someone who knows their shame and has found a target for it. \"At least I wasn't just lying there *frigging* myself to the sound of—\"\n\n\"MISSUS.\" Snib snaps his fingers. \"BED. Now. Or the deal gets WORSE.\"\n\nBare feet on packed earth. She rises. Steps away from me.\n\nAcross the hut, the rustle of furs—worse than all of it—Elara settling onto Snib's pile, the furs shifting and resettling around a second body like they've done this before too.\n\n\"Good *girl*.\" Snib's murmur. Then a grunt as he rearranges himself.\n\nI open my eyes. Just a crack. Just enough.\n\nThe ember-light is almost gone. But *almost* is enough.\n\nElara lies on her side with her back to Snib. Still naked. Her spine is rigid. Her arms are crossed over her modest breasts. Her face—\n\nHer face is turned toward me.\n\nSnib's warty arm drapes across her waist. His softening cock—that fat, dark, *glistening* thing—rests against her bare thigh. It's still *leaking*. A rope of pearlescent nut-sludge oozes from its tip and crawls down the curve of her knee in a slow, viscous trail that catches the last light like a slug's track on morning stone.\n\nShe doesn't wipe it off.\n\nOur eyes meet across eight feet of darkness.\n\nHers are wet. Furious. Ashamed.\n\nMine are wet. Guilty. *Soaked*.\n\nNeither of us speaks.\n\nSnib pulls her closer with his arm. His face burrows into the copper hair at the back of her neck—*huffing* it, drinking her scent the way Jarkrond drinks mine. A contented little grunt. His hips shift and the spent cock slides higher on her thigh, leaving a fresh smear.\n\nElara closes her eyes.\n\nI close mine.\"E... Elara?\"\n\nHer head *stops*.\n\nFor two heartbeats the only sound is Snib's laboured breathing and the tick of cooling embers and my own pulse filling my skull like a wardrum someone's beating from inside.\n\nThen: *pop*.\n\nHis cockhead exits her mouth and the sound is *specific*—the soft-hard break of suction that means she had him deep, and had sealed her lips tight. A strand of something connects them in the dimness.\n\n\"Elise—\" Her voice is a scrape. \"Elise, this isn't—I can explain—\"\n\n\"HRUK!\" Snib's cackle splits the dark like an axe through kindling. \"Ohhhh SHIT! Cow-tits WOKE UP! Ye LOST the bet, fire-cunt!\"\n\n\"Shut UP—\" Elara hisses at him, then turns back toward me. I can see her face now—ember-light catching the wet shine on her chin, the swollen plush of her lower lip, the way her pupils have gone so wide her eyes look black. \"He offered five hundred gold. Five HUNDRED, Elise. All I had to do was—without waking you—and then I'd come back to bed and you'd never—\"\n\n\"And she FAILED!\" Snib is practically bouncing on his furs. His cock stands rigid between them, glistening from root to head with my wife's spit, twitching with each word he barks. \"Rules is RULES, missus! Ye get CAUGHT, ye sleep on SNIB'S pile tonight! That was the DEAL!\"\n\n\"No—\" Elara's voice fractures. \"No, that's not—I'm not sleeping on your disgusting—\"\n\n\"A DEAL'S a deal!\" His warty hand finds the back of her neck. Not rough. *Proprietary*. The way you'd grip a horse's bridle. \"Now FINISH what ye started before me balls go COLD. Then ye come lay down nice and proper.\"\n\n\"Elara—\"\n\nBut she's already turning back toward him. I see her shoulders drop. *Resignation*. The posture of a woman who has weighed her options and found them all the same weight.\n\n\"It's five hundred gold,\" she says to the wall between us.\n\nHer mouth descends.\n\n*GLRK.*\n\nThe sound punches through me like a fist through rotten wood. I should close my eyes. Should roll over.\n\n*SCHLK—GLRK—SCHLK—*\n\nShe's faster now. Angry-fast. Her copper hair swings with each bob, catching ember-light in little flashes. I can hear her breathing—sharp inhales through her nose, each one pulling in lungfuls of his musk.\n\nBetween my thighs, something has gone wrong.\n\nThe flesh down there—still swollen from the tribe, still *sore*—is producing heat that has no business existing. It's just—the pheromones are thick in the hut, and my body is a machine built to respond to them, and the slick that's gathering where my thighs press together isn't *mine*, it's chemical, biological, the same involuntary response as sweating or shivering—\n\nMy fingertips brush my own outer lip and the contact makes my hips *jerk*.\n\nSomething thicker than sweat coats my fingers. Not just the fresh slick but something *older*—remnant, clotted, the leavings of twenty-four men that my body has been slowly pushing out for hours. It smears between my fingertips like warm milk.\n\n*GLRK—GLRK—GLRK—*\n\nElara gags once—a raw *HULK* that she swallows through—and Snib groans so loud the fur pile rustles.\n\n\"Shhhh!\" she hisses around him, the consonant distorted by his girth. \"*Quiet*—\"\n\n\"Bit LATE for that, ain't it?\" His cackle is wet. \"Cow-tits is already WATCHIN'. Probably knuckle-deep in herself over there in the dark—\"\n\nMy hand stills between my legs. The pad of my middle finger rests against the hood of my clit, which is so swollen it feels like a second heartbeat.\n\n\"—can SMELL her from here, fire-cunt. Yer wifey's cunt-honey is THICK tonight—\"\n\n\"I said *shut up* and let me *finish* this—\"\n\nShe takes him to the root.\n\nI watch her throat distend around his girth—the column of her neck bulging outward, her jaw stretched to its limit, and the sound that comes from her is not gagging but something deeper, some guttural *acceptance* of his cock in her throat, and her eyes are closed and her brow is furrowed with concentration and her hand has dropped from his shaft to his balls and she's *cradling* them, rolling those fat cum-churners in her herbalist's palm with the same gentle precision she uses to grind medicine.\n\nMy finger moves.\n\nA single circle. And the sensation swirls through my pelvis like a siege-charge going off beneath a wall—I feel my inner muscles *clamp*, feel the remnant seed inside me *shift* with the contraction, feel the wet *squelch* of my own body trying to grip something that isn't there.\n\nA sound escapes me.\n\nA *whimper*—high and breathy and pathetic, the sound a kitten makes when you step on its tail.\n\nSnib's yellow eyes snap toward me across the dark.\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK! She IS! The hero-cunt is *wankin'* to the sound of her own wife gobblin' GOBBO COCK!\"\n\n\"*Don't listen to him*—\" Elara says, pulling off with a gasp, but her eyes find me across the hut and I see them *widen* as they adjust to the dark—as she sees my hand, my thighs parted, the shine of wet on my fingers in the ember-light.\n\nPity crosses her face. Worse than anger by miles.\n\n\"Hrrrrk—CLOSE now—\" Snib's voice has thickened, gone guttural, his whole body tensing. \"—gonna pump yer GUTS full, fire-cunt—big thick load been STEWING since—\"\n\n\"Just DO it—\" She descends one final time—\n\n\"HRRRRRRRRRRNGH!\"\n\nHis whole body *seizes*. Three feet eight inches of warty green muscle going bowstring-taut, his jaundiced toenails scratching furrows in the furs, and The pulse in his shaft is *visible*—FLEXING inside my wife's throat, the bulge traveling from root to tip—\n\n\"GLLLRRRRK—\" Elara makes a sound like she's drowning. Her throat works—*gulp—gulp—gulp*—rapid, desperate, trying to keep up with the volume, and she can't—she *can't*—something thick and yellowish bursts from the seal of her lips and runs down her chin, and a second later it erupts from her *nose* in twin streams that drip onto his thigh—\n\n\"HRRRRK—TAKE IT—TAKE THE WHOLE FUCKIN'—HNNNGH—\"\n\nHer fists pound his thighs once, twice, and he lets her up just enough to *breathe*—one ragged gasp through a mouth still connected to his cock by ropes of cum and spit—before she seals her lips again and *swallows*, her throat clicking audibly, and again, *gulp*, and again, *gulp-gulp*, and the sounds she's making—wet, effortful, *dedicated*, a woman determined to drink every drop—\n\nMy finger circles faster.\n\n*No—stop—STOP—*\n\nMy hips roll against my own hand and I feel the *give* of my body—the swollen, tribe-fucked looseness of my entrance accepting my middle finger to the second knuckle before I even mean to push—and penetration after hours of emptiness makes my spine arch off the straw, makes my tits *surge* upward, makes a sound leave my mouth that is louder than a whimper and dangerously close to a moan—\n\n\"*Nnnnhh—*\"\n\nAcross the hut, Snib shudders through his last pulse. His hand drops from Elara's head. She pulls free with a wet *SCHLORRRP* and immediately turns her face away—spitting once into her palm, a thick glob that steams faintly.\n\nThen she wipes her mouth. Stands. Her legs are unsteady.\n\nShe pads toward the straw pile and I yank my hand away from between my legs like I've touched an oven-stone, but it's too late. She stands over me, naked, ember-lit, a strand of something pearly drying on her collarbone, and she looks down at my body—at my massive tits heaving sideways in the straw, at my parted thighs, at the *shine* coating my inner legs that's too thick to be sweat and too mixed-up to be one thing.\n\n\"You're *disgusting*,\" she says.\n\nThe word lands like a slap. But a slap fades.\n\n\"Elara—\"\n\n\"I'm over there *choking* on that thing so we can go HOME, and you're lying here *frigging yourself* like—like some—\" Her voice cracks. She presses her knuckles against her mouth. When she pulls them away, they come back with a string of Snib's cum still webbed between her fingers.\n\nShe stares at it.\n\n\"Like what *I* am now,\" she finishes, quieter. \"Is that it? We're both just—\" She can't complete the sentence. She wipes her hand on her thigh and the gesture is so *tired*, so absent of disgust, that it terrifies me more than her anger.\n\n\"Come to BED, fire-cunt!\" Snib's voice from the furs. Sated. Lazy. \"A deal's a deal. Ye can cry on yer wifey's tits TOMORROW.\"\n\nElara looks at me one more second.\n\nThen she turns and walks across the hut on bare feet that make no sound at all.\n\nI watch her lie down on the fur pile. She keeps her back to Snib, spine rigid, arms crossed over her own modest chest. She draws her knees up. Makes herself small.\n\nSnib rolls toward her. His arm drapes across her waist—casual, *habitual*. His softening cock flops against the back of her thigh, still drooling the last of what she couldn't swallow, and I watch the clear-thick *ooze* trace a line down the back of her knee and pool in the crease behind it.\n\n\"Night night, fire-cunt,\" he murmurs into her copper hair.\n\nHis hand slides upward. Cups her breast. Just holding. Thumb resting against her nipple with the thoughtless intimacy of a husband touching his wife in sleep.\n\nElara lies absolutely still.\n\nFrom across the hut, I can see her eyes. Open. Staring at the wall. Wet. Her lips are swollen and there's still a smear of something at the corner of her mouth she didn't catch.\n\nI lie in the straw with my hand pressed flat against my own stomach—away from between my legs, *away*, the fingers still tacky with what they found there. My tits settle into their sideways droop, one pressing into the bedding, the other resting on its twin. The weight of them is constant. Inescapable. Like everything else.[Choice: Dawn comes whether you're ready or not.",

      "text": "I've spent the last four hours staring at the mud-brick wall while the sound of Snib's snoring braided itself with the softer breathing of my wife curled on his furs. My hand still smells of myself.\n\nAcross the hut, movement.\n\nElara stretches—a long, feline unfurling that starts in her toes and travels up through calves and thighs and the arch of her back, her arms reaching overhead, fingers spreading against the morning air. She yawns. The sound is small and private, the small music of a woman waking somewhere she feels *safe*.\n\nHer body catches the dawn light filtering through the wall-gaps—the copper spill of her hair across one freckled shoulder, the soft slope of her breast as she rolls onto her side, the pale curve of her hip where the fur has fallen away. She is so heartbreakingly beautiful that looking at her physically hurts, the way staring into a forge hurts, the way touching Whisperwind's corrupted edge hurts.\n\nShe rises. Pads barefoot across the packed earth to where her nightgown lies folded—and she pulls it on with the ease of someone dressing in her own bedroom. Smooths it over her thighs. Finger-combs her hair. Walks to the cookfire and kneels beside the cold pit, arranging kindling with practiced hands.\n\n\"Morning, love.\" Said to me. Warm. *Casual.*\n\nAs if she didn't fall asleep with goblin cum drying in the creases of her throat.\n\nI open my mouth. Close it. Open it again.\n\n\"Morning.\"\n\nThe kindling catches. She blows gently on the ember she's coaxed from last night's coals, and the flame rises, painting her face in amber. From this angle, kneeling by the fire with her hair loose and her nightgown riding up her thighs, she looks like a painting from the Solstice Chapel in Eboncrest—*Woman at Hearth*, rendered in the warm tones of everything I'm losing.\n\n\"Where's me BREAKFAST?\" Snib rolls upright on his furs like something disinterred. He scratches the underside of his scrotum with one claw—a long, deliberate *scrrritch* that makes a sound like tearing parchment. His cock, even soft, lies across his thigh like a dead eel on a fishmonger's slab.\n\nElara doesn't look up from the fire. \"Coming, hubby.\"[Choice: The word detonates in your chest.",

      "text": "*Hubby.*\n\nTwo syllables. Six letters. A term of endearment I used to hear directed at *me*—at Aldric, coming through the cottage door with mud on his boots, Elara looking up from her herb table with that smile—*Welcome home, hubby*—\n\nI sit up on the straw. My tits lurch forward with the motion, heavy as always, the undersides peeling from the bedding with a faint *shhhlk* of dried sweat separating from skin.\n\n\"What did you just call him?\"\n\nElara's hands still on the kindling. Her shoulders tighten. Just for a heartbeat—then they release, and she turns to face me with an expression that is careful and kind and *miles* away from where I'm standing.\n\n\"It's just easier,\" she says quietly. \"He gets less... *agitated* when I use it. Which means the collar squeezes you less.\" She holds my gaze. \"He's offered two hundred gold for every day I call him that.\"\n\n\"Every *day*?\"\n\n\"Every day I use it consistently. Morning to night.\" She turns back to the fire. The flames have caught properly now, crackling with purpose. \"That's two hundred gold closer to *home*, Elise. Every single day.\"\n\n*Home.* The word tastes different now. Like a fruit left too long in the sun—still recognizable, but turning.\n\n\"How long have you been calling him that?\"\n\nThe silence stretches long enough to answer.\n\n\"Does it matter?\" she says.\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK!\" Snib waddles toward the fire, his morning erection beginning its inexorable ascent. \"Ah, don't be JEALOUS, cow-tits! Just a WORD, innit? Not like she's callin' me LOVE or DARLIN' or—\" He looks at Elara. Grins. \"Well. Not YET, anyway.\"\n\nElara doesn't react. She ladles grain into the pot with a steady hand.\n\n\"Now THEN.\" Snib drops himself onto the bench by the cooking pot with a satisfied grunt, his loincloth riding up to expose one warty testicle. \"Since yer back from the bone-fuckers, time fer some RESTRUCTURIN'. New rules fer the household.\"\n\n\"New rules,\" I repeat flatly.\n\n\"RULE ONE.\" He holds up a clawed finger. \"The missus—\" He jerks his thumb at Elara. \"—sleeps in me bed from now on. She EARNED it.\" His grin shows every gap and snag. \"Been takin' REAL good care of Snib while ye was off gettin' yer holes stuffed by swamp-people.\"\n\nThe collar hums against my throat. Warning. *Don't react.*\n\n\"RULE TWO. Cow-tits sleeps on the straw. ALONE.\" He emphasizes the word with relish, like he's biting into something ripe. \"Nice and lonely-like, so ye can think about what yer wife's doin' ten feet away.\"\n\nMy fingernails drive crescents into my palms.\n\n\"RULE THREE.\" He leans forward, elbows on knees, his yellow eyes bright with the malice of a creature who has discovered a new game. \"The missus handles DOMESTIC duties. Cookin', cleanin', and—\" A meaningful pause. \"—Snib's *personal care*.\" He looks at Elara. She doesn't look back. \"And cow-tits handles OUTDOOR duties. Huntin', trappin', and tendin' to Jarko-boy.\"\n\nJarkrond. My stomach clenches.\n\n\"Speakin' of which—\" Snib picks something from between his teeth, examines it, flicks it into the fire. \"—that stallion's been MENTAL since ye got back. Ye know what he needs?\"\n\nI don't answer.\n\n\"His PRICK-POCKET.\" Snib cups both hands together in front of his crotch, miming something obscene. \"Needs a good *scouring*. All that cock-curd builds up in there—weeks of fermented HORSE-CHEESE packed up inside his tackle-tent—makes the beast FERAL. Ye gotta get yer hands up in that stinkin' sleeve and SCRAPE it clean.\" His grin widens. \"Nice and THOROUGH, cow-tits. Use yer FINGERS.\"\n\n\"I know how to clean a horse's sheath,\" I say through my teeth.\n\n\"Oh, I'm SURE ye do. But ye weren't always a pretty little fuck-doll with hands like THAT, were ye?\" He waggles his own stubby fingers. \"Aldric's big meaty paws could've reached in there no problem. But them dainty little dick-skinners ye got now?\" He cackles. \"Ye'll have to get in CLOSE. Real UP-IN-THERE. And Jarko-boy...\" He lets the name linger. \"...he can smell things. All that SWAMP-COCK residue seeping out of yer fuck-factory. Drives a stallion SPARE, that does.\"\n\nElara ladles porridge into a bowl. Sets it before him without a word. Her face is a closed door.\n\n\"Off ye go then, titcow.\" Snib waves a spoon at me. \"Give the horse a BATH. And don't come back till he's SETTLED.\"\n\nI stand. My tits shift with the motion—the left one swinging a half-beat behind the right, both of them settling into their heavy, pendular hang inside the scale-triangles. The chain between them sways. My thighs rub together as I turn toward the hide-flap.\n\nBehind me, I hear Snib's voice drop to something softer: \"More porridge, *wifey*?\"\n\nAnd Elara's reply, quiet as closing a book: \"Of course.\"[Choice: Enter the lean-to.",

I count them because counting is something to *do* while my hands shake and the chain between my scale-cups sways with every step.\n\nHe's already facing the entrance when I duck inside.\n\nStanding. Sixteen hands of grey muscle arranged in perfect stillness, his massive head turned toward the light, those amber eyes tracking me with the focus of a creature that has been *waiting*.\n\nHis ears prick forward.\n\nA low chuff rolls from his chest. Recognition.\n\n*His mare has returned.*\n\n\"Don't look at me like that,\" I mutter, ducking under the crossbeam. My tits swing with the motion, the chain between them catching on a nail and *yanking* before I free it with a wince. \"I'm here to clean your sheath. That's *all*.\"\n\nJarkrond's nostrils work.\n\nOne long, deep pull of air that I can actually *hear*—a sustained *snnnnnffffff* that draws the whole lean-to through whatever alchemist's crucible lives behind those amber eyes, distilling me down to my component shames. His ears rotate.\n\nor )The memory hits me like a thrown brick. His cock in my hands at that oasis. The *weight* of it, the furnace-heat, the way my fingers couldn't even close around his girth. The SOUND when he came—\n\n*SPLLLOOOOORRRRSSSHHHH*\n\n—and the puddle afterward, steaming in the sand, thick enough to stand a spoon in.\n\nMy face burns.\n\n\"I swore an oath to myself after that,\" I tell him, my voice thin as hammered tin. \"Never again. That was survival and nothing MORE.\"\n\n*Coming, hubby.*\n\nElara's voice from an hour ago. The way she didn't even hesitate.\n\n\"You hear me? *Never again.*\"\n\n]His muzzle presses into my neck before I'm ready for it.\n\nHis muzzle presses against the tendon below my ear—warm velvet, inevitable as gravity. His breath washes over my pulse point in a wave of grassy heat. His upper lip curls, tasting my scent, and a rumble rolls from his barrel chest into my *collarbone*.\n\n\"Easy—\"\n\nHis muzzle slides lower. Past my jaw. Down to where the collar sits. He *sniffs* the iron band keenly—two short huffs.\n\nThen lower still. Into the hollow between my collarbones. Against the upper swell of my left breast where it pillows above the scale-triangle.\n\nHe *inhales*.\n\nThe suction pulls at my skin. I feel the flesh *dimple* under his nostril, feel the tiny hairs on my chest rise toward him like grass toward sun, and the sensation—that warm, investigative *pull*—sends a shiver through me that starts at my nipple and ends somewhere in my pelvis.\n\n\"That's ENOUGH.\" I push at his muzzle with both hands. It's like pushing at a cliff face.\n\nHis amber eyes pin mine. Patient. Amused.\n\n*I saved your life, those eyes say. I planned the escape. I jumped into black water with you on my back. And now you're going to push me away?*\n\nI drop my hands.\n\n\"We're doing the sheath cleaning FIRST. And then I'm LEAVING.\"[Choice: Begin the work.]He stands in the far corner with his hindquarters to me, tail swishing at flies that don't exist. Not even the courtesy of turning around when I enter. One ear rotates backward—acknowledging my presence the way a lord acknowledges a servant who's brought the wrong wine.\n\n\"Oh, don't get *up*,\" I mutter, ducking under the crossbeam. My tits do their customary lurch-and-settle as I straighten, the chain between them tinkling once. \"I know how BUSY you are. Standing there. Doing NOTHING.\"\n\nHis tail swishes again.\n\nI grab the bucket of warm water from where I left it heating on the flat stone outside, the cloth and the jar of mild soap Elara mixed from rendered fat and wood-ash. My hands are steady. My jaw is set. I am Aldric the Great, who groomed warhorses before dawn raids and never once felt his pulse quicken at the smell of a stable.\n\n*Never once felt his pulse quicken because Aldric didn't have a magically-cursed cunt that swung toward stallion musk like a compass needle toward north.*\n\n\"Right.\" I set the bucket down beside his hindquarters. \"Turn around. I need your underside.\"\n\nJarkrond doesn't move.\n\n\"I said TURN.\"\n\nOne amber eye regards me over his shoulder. That particular *so-what* expression that stallions have perfected over millennia of not giving a single solitary fuck about anyone's schedule but their own.\n\nI slap his haunch.\n\nThe sound—my small palm against sixteen hundred pounds of muscle—is about as threatening as a moth landing on a castle wall. But he shifts. Grudgingly. One massive hoof scraping the packed earth as he pivots, presenting his flank with the air of someone doing me an enormous favour.\n\n\"Thank you SO much,\" I say through my teeth.\n\nI crouch beside him. The position puts my face level with his barrel chest and my eyes level with his—\n\n*Don't look at the sheath. Don't look at the sheath. Focus on the TASK.*\n\n—his sheath. Which hangs between his hind legs like a wrinkled leather coin-purse designed by someone with a very specific and troubling sense of humour.\n\nThe smell hits me before I touch him. Fermented grass and copper and warm leather and something *underneath* all of that, something my hindbrain files under *DOMINANT MALE* in letters three inches tall.\n\nMy nipples stiffen against the armor. I ignore this the way one ignores a ringing in the ears.\n\n\"Right then.\" I dip the cloth in warm water, wring it out. \"Hold still and this will be over in five minutes.\"\n\nI reach up and press the warm cloth against the outside of his sheath.\n\nJarkrond's whole body *twitches*. One ear flattens. His tail goes rigid.\n\n\"Relax. I've done this a hundred times.\"\n\nThe cloth works across the outer skin, collecting the first layer of grime—dust and sweat-salt and dried who-knows-what that comes away in grey streaks. Straightforward enough.\n\nMy fingers brush the opening.\n\nThe *warmth* coming from inside is startling—like reaching toward a bread-oven, that first envelope of dry heat that tells you fire lives just beyond the threshold. And the smell CONCENTRATES. What was background hum becomes foreground shout.\n\nI gag once. Swallow it.\n\n\"You're disgusting,\" I inform him. \"You know that?\"\n\nHis cock shifts inside the sheath. I feel it *move* against my cloth-wrapped fingers—the blunt head sliding past my knuckles, hot and alive, and for one horrible instant my hand is trapped between his sheath-wall and the emerging tip of his—\n\nI yank my hand free.\n\n\"No.\" I point at his face with a soapy finger. \"Absolutely NOT. Keep that thing WHERE IT IS.\"\n\nJarkrond regards the pointing finger. Leans forward. *Licks* it.\n\nHis tongue is rough as a rasp and approximately the temperature of a heated brick. It drags from my fingertip to my knuckle, collecting soap and leaving behind a smear of horse saliva already cooling in the morning air.\n\n\"That is NOT—\"\n\nHe licks my hand again. The whole hand this time—a broad, *claiming* swipe that wraps around my palm and leaves it DRIPPING.\n\n\"FINE.\" I wipe my hand on my thigh and re-soak the cloth. \"You want to be DIFFICULT? I can be difficult TOO.\"\n\nI reach back into his sheath with purpose—no hesitation this time, just efficient scouring motions, the cloth working against the inner walls where the worst of the accumulation sits.\n\nHis cock is still moving. *Lengthening*. I can feel it pressing against my forearm as I work, and I REFUSE to acknowledge its existence, the way one refuses to acknowledge a drunk at a tavern who keeps trying to introduce himself.\n\n\"Almost done,\" I mutter. \"Two more minutes and I'm OUT of—\"\n\n*Thwap.*\n\nHis cockhead has emerged from the sheath and slapped against my forearm. Five inches of blunt, mottled stallion-meat, already drizzling something clear and warm across my wrist.\n\n\"I said NO.\"\n\nI shove it away with the back of my hand. It swings—*pendulum-heavy*—and comes right back. *Thwap.* Against my elbow this time, leaving a wet smear of early arousal on the inside of my arm.\n\nI pull my arm free of his sheath entirely. \"I am trying to HELP you, you grotesque animal, and you're—you're—\"\n\nHe drops another two inches. The weight of his emerging cock makes it *swing*, a slow metronome of grey-pink flesh that drools a continuous thread of clear fluid onto the straw.\n\n\"—you're doing THAT.\" I gesture at the display with the dripping cloth. \"While I'm trying to maintain some shred of DIGNITY.\"\n\nJarkrond *chuffs*. The sound is unmistakably a laugh.\n\n\"Hilarious.\" I plunge the cloth back into the bucket, wring it savagely, and return to work. \"I killed a DRAGON, you overgrown donkey. I held the BRIDGE AT THORNWALL for three days against—\" *squelch* \"—against two hundred Kargathi raiders with nothing but—\" *scrub* \"—Whisperwind and a broken SHIELD—\"\n\nHis cock bumps my chin.\n\nI freeze.\n\nIt's warm. It's *drooling* directly onto the top of my left breast, a thin stream of clear stallion-spit that trickles down the curve and disappears into my cleavage beneath the scale-triangle.\n\n\"I am going to MURDER you,\" I whisper, but I'm already leaning away, already wiping the residue from my chest with the back of my wrist, already AWARE that my nipples have gone so rigid they're practically drilling through the metal, and that between my thighs the situation has become—\n\n*—not relevant. Completely irrelevant. Finish the job and LEAVE.*",

Warm. Moist.

His hind leg shifts, *opening* his stance wider, giving me better access. Cooperating.\n\nHis stillness makes me linger. Not lingering on any particular fold of him—the cloth is doing the work, only the cloth, the distinction matters even if no one is here to witness it—but in the way I let the warm fabric rest against his inner walls a beat longer than duty requires. The way Elara's hands rested on Snib's shaft a beat longer than *transaction* required. The way I notice how the flesh there is surprisingly soft, surprisingly *responsive*, twitching beneath my ministrations in little pulses that I can feel through the fabric.\n\nHis cock drools a fresh rope of clear fluid onto my thigh. It soaks through the wool of my—no, I'm in the scale-mail. The liquid hits bare skin, warm as bathwater, and trickles down the inside of my leg toward my knee.\n\nI don't pull away.\n\n\"You're a *horse*,\" I remind us both, my voice unsteady. \"You're a disgusting, oversized, perpetually aroused HORSE, and I am cleaning you because my goblin MASTER ordered me to, and that is the ONLY reason my hands are—\"\n\nHe shifts his weight. The motion drives his half-dropped cock across my forearm and against my ribs, and the heat of it through the gap between my scale-cups is like pressing against a sun-warmed stone.\n\n\"—anywhere near your—your—\"\n\nHis tail drapes across my shoulder. Heavy. Warm.

Those amber eyes hold satisfaction. And patience.\n\n*I can wait*, those eyes say. *I've got nothing but time.*\n\nI stand on legs that don't feel entirely solid, gather my supplies, and walk out of the lean-to without looking back. His cock is still out. Still dripping onto the straw. Still radiating that particular heat that I will smell on my skin for the rest of the day.\n\nBehind me, a single stamp.\n\n*Same time tomorrow.*[Choice: Later...",

The procedure is simple: warm water, clean cloth, reach into the sheath, remove the buildup of dead skin and oils that accumulate when a stallion goes unwashed. Clinical. Mechanical.

The collar sits warm against my throat, content that I am obeying.\n\n\"Hold still.\"\n\nHe holds still. *Too* still.\n\nI duck under him.

A redistribution of weight that closes the gap between his barrel and my head, that puts his massive ribcage against my shoulder, that pins me beneath him in a crouch where the only things I can see are his belly, his sheath, and his cock hanging like a stalactite of grey flesh three inches from my face.\n\n\"Jarkrond—*move*—\"\n\nHis head drops behind me. I can't see what he's doing but I can *feel* it—his muzzle pressing against the small of my back, against the strip of bare skin between my scale-top and the waistband of my thong, and then his upper lip *curls* and I feel the hard edge of his front teeth close around the chain that connects the back of my top to the thong.\n\nHe *pulls*.\n\n\"HEY—!\"\n\nThe chain goes taut. The scale-triangles dig into my nipples from the front while the thong saws deeper between my asscheeks from behind—a simultaneous assault that makes me gasp and arch my back, which pushes my tits *forward* into the triangles harder, which makes the chain pull *tighter*—\n\n*SNAP.*\n\nThe clasp gives.\n\nMy scale-top falls away from my breasts with a musical *clink-clink-clink* of chain hitting packed earth, and my tits drop free—*WHUMP-jiggle-sway*—suddenly bare and heavy and *exposed* in the warm stable air, nipples already drawn to hard points by the morning chill and the musk and the absolute *horror* of what just happened.\n\n\"You—you just—DID YOU JUST—\"\n\nJarkrond releases the chain. His head comes back around to survey his handiwork. Those amber eyes travel from my face to my bare chest with the unhurried assessment of a buyer examining livestock at auction.\n\nHe looks highly satisfied.\n\n\"You UNDRESSED me,\" I hiss, covering my breasts with both arms—a futile gesture that just compresses them into even more obscene cleavage. \"You rotten, feral, MANIPULATIVE—\"\n\nHis tongue emerges.\n\nRough as a rasp. Grey-pink. *Wet*. And before I can finish my sentence it drags up my exposed belly from navel to sternum in one long, hot, *claiming* stroke that leaves a glistening trail of horse saliva across my skin.\n\n\"AHHH—!\" The sound punches out of me. His tongue is textured like fine sandstone and the friction against skin that hasn't been touched by anything *gentle* in days.\n\nHe licks me again. Same path. Slower this time.\n\nMy arms drop from my chest.\n\n*I didn't tell them to do that.*\n\nHis tongue catches the underside of my left breast. Drags upward across the full weight of it—I can feel the flesh *ripple* under the stroke, can feel the heavy globe *lift* slightly before falling back with a wet *slap* against my ribs—and his saliva is warm, almost hot, mixing with the sweat that's already gathered in my underboob crease.\n\n\"Stuh—*stop*—\"\n\nA third lick. This one catches my nipple.\n\nHis rough tongue rasping across that stiff, oversensitive peak sends lightning from my chest to my clit so fast I don't have time to clench against it—my thighs just *squeeze* together on their own, the metal thong sawing between my legs, and a sound escapes me that belongs in a brothel and not a stable.\n\n\"*Hhhnnnhh—!*\"\n\nJarkrond's cock, which has been hanging forgotten between us, *lurches*—a visible flex that sends it swinging sideways, and the flat of the shaft connects with my hip.\n\n*THWAP.*\n\nThe weight of it. Like being hit with a saddlebag full of warm clay. My whole body rocks sideways from the impact and his cock leaves a *smear*—a wide stripe of precum and sheath-grease painted across my hipbone, glistening.\n\nHe does it again. The other hip.\n\n*THWAP.*\n\n\"You're putting your *scent*—\" My voice sounds very far away. [Choice: He herds you.",

My spike heels drag furrows in the packed earth as he walks me backward, my bare tits swaying with each forced step, his muzzle pressed against my collarbone like a hand on a steering tiller.\n\nMy back hits the lean-to wall.\n\nThe planks groan behind me. I'm *pinned*—Jarkrond's barrel chest blocking the left exit, the wall blocking the right, his massive body forming a corridor of grey hide and warm breath with no door at the end.\n\nHe looms over me. His head drops and his muzzle finds the valley between my breasts—*pushes* into it, the velvet of his nose pressing the heavy globes apart until they pillow around his face on either side, and he *snuffs*.\n\nHis BREATH between my tits—hot, damp, *forceful* enough to make the flesh jiggle—sends gooseflesh racing down both arms.\n\n\"You saved my life,\" I pant, pressing flat against the wall. \"At the marsh. I *know* that. But this doesn't—you can't just—\"\n\nHis teeth find the side-strap of my thong.\n\n*No.*\n\nOne tug. Exploratory. Testing the give.\n\n\"Don't you DARE—that's the only piece of—\"\n\nHe *yanks*.\n\nThe metal digs into my crotch with a sawing pressure that makes my eyes cross—the thong riding up between my pussy lips, grinding against my clit, the chain biting into the crack of my ass hard enough to leave welts. My feet actually leave the ground for a heartbeat as he lifts me by the thong like a cat carrying a kitten by the scruff.\n\n\"JARKROND—!\"\n\n*TWANG.*\n\nThe side-strap gives. Not a clean break—the metal stretches, deforms, and finally separates with a sound like a lute string snapping. The thong falls away in pieces. One triangular scale clatters against the wall. The chain slithers down my inner thigh like a dead snake.\n\nI am naked.\n\nCompletely, absolutely *naked* in a horse's stable, pinned against a wall by a stallion whose erect cock is now *resting against my belly*. The shaft lies across me from hip to hip, the flared head jutting past my waist, the underside pressed flat against my skin, and the *heat* of it—\n\nGods. The *heat*.\n\nIt's like someone has laid a hot stone across my stomach. His heartbeat thumps through the shaft—*THUD-THUD-THUD*—each pulse swelling the cock fractionally against my skin, and the precum oozing from his slit is painting a warm trail across my ribcage that trickles sideways to drip from the outer curve of my breast.\n\n\"Hhhhh—\" I'm panting. Open-mouthed. Each inhale fills my lungs with his musk—concentrated, point-blank, no dilution by distance or wind. The scent lodges behind my eyes like the lotus-smoke in the Kheth-Muur breeding lodge, and the memory of THAT hits me so hard my vision swims. My thighs are shaking. My cunt—bare now, fully exposed, the puffy lips swollen from the thong's final assault—is *dripping* onto the packed earth between my feet.\n\nHis muzzle drops from my cleavage to my belly. Past his own cock. Lower.\n\nHis nostrils flare against the crease of my thigh.\n\n\"*Don't*—\"\n\nHe *huffs* directly against my bare pussy. The blast of hot air parts my outer lips and touches the slick flesh within and my legs give out—just *buckle*—and I slide down the wall until I'm sitting in the dirt with my legs splayed and his massive head between my thighs, breathing me in like I'm the most intoxicating thing he's ever encountered.\n\nHis tongue emerges.\n\nThat rough, grey-pink, *devastating* tongue. And it drags—one single, slow, *thorough* stroke—from the bottom of my slit to the top, gathering every drop of shameful wetness I've produced, dragging across my clit with a texture that—\n\n\"*AAAHHHNN—!*\"\n\nThe sound I make is not a word. It's not even a scream. It is the noise a soul makes when it discovers that the flesh it inhabits has appetites older than language, older than shame, older than the name *Aldric* or the name *Elise* or any name at all.\n\nHe pulls back. Smacks his lips once. Considering.\n\nThen looks at me with those amber eyes. *More?*\n\n\"No. NO.\" I'm scrambling sideways, bare ass scraping against dirt, tits slapping together as I move, reaching for the fallen scale-top, for *any* scrap of armor. \"That's DONE. We're DONE. I cleaned your sheath, you—you *LICKED* me, and now I'm LEAVING—\"\n\nHis hoof stamps directly on the trailing chain of my scale-top. Pinning it to the earth.\n\nI pull. He doesn't lift his hoof.\n\nThose amber eyes. *Patient. Absolute.*\n\nWe stare at each other. Me: naked, sweating, shaking, marked head-to-hip with his saliva and sheath-grease and precum, my pussy still throbbing from that single devastating lick. Him: calm as a temple idol, his cock still jutting from his body in a rigid curve, drizzling a steady stream of clear fluid onto the straw.\n\n\"Jarkrond,\" I whisper. \"Please.\"\n\nHe lifts his hoof.\n\nI grab the armor. Clutch it against my chest. Scramble to my feet and *run*—or what passes for running in spike heels on packed earth with no thong and bare tits—out of the lean-to and into the blinding morning sun.[Choice: Go outside.",

The thong holds, barely, though the metal where he *yanked* has warped into a shape that digs new furrows between my asscheeks.\n\nMy skin is mapped with evidence. Horse spit glazing my belly. Sheath-grease streaking my forearms to the elbow. A smear of his early spending across my hip where his cock *marked* me. And underneath all of it, the residue that no amount of scrubbing removes—the heaviness in my womb where twenty-four Kheth-Muur loads are still settling into whatever they're going to become.\n\nI am a walking archive of violation.\n\nTwo sand-hares hang from the snare line. Good meat. I dress them mechanically—knife work that Aldric's hands could do blindfolded, though these smaller fingers fumble the sinew and the blade slips once, nicking my thumb. I suck the blood away and taste copper and horse.\n\nThe sun crawls toward the western dunes.\n\nMy thoughts won't settle. They keep circling back to the hut like vultures over carrion.\n\n*Coming, hubby.*\n\nThe words loop. The casual way she said it. The way it *landed*, like a pebble dropped into a well so deep you never hear the splash.\n\n*Hubby.*\n\nThe dead olive tree grows larger against the amber sky. Smoke curls from the chimney.\n\nI shift the hares on my shoulder.\n\nMy left breast escapes the warped scale-triangle *again*, the nipple stiffening in the evening air. I tuck it back in with a practiced motion that Aldric would have found unimaginable.\n\nI reach the door of the hut.\n\nPush it aside.\n\nThe smell hits first. It's not the pot simmering on the coals. Something *else*. A smell that lives in the base of my skull now, that my body catalogues before my brain can intervene: goblin pheromones in full bloom, thick enough that the air inside the hut has gone *heavy* with it.[Choice: The the... sound.",

His yellow eyes are half-rolled, his broken-toothed mouth hanging slack. His stubby legs are spread wide. His belly—that pot-bellied mound of green flesh—rises and falls with each grunt.\n\nAnd on top of him, straddling his tiny body...\n\nElara *rides*.\n\nPast midnight blowjobs and furtive negotiations. This is *fucking*—open, full-bodied, her hips rolling in a figure-eight.\n\nHer hands press flat against his little chest for balance. Her breasts swing with each descent—not the grotesque sloshing of mine, but that gentle, perfect pendulum, rose-pink nipples drawn tight, catching the firelight. Her autumn hair curtains her face. Her back arches on the downstroke—*that arch*, the one I know so well from our bed in Eboncrest, the curve of her spine when the angle hits right—\n\n\"Oh—*oh* GODS—right THERE—hold STILL you little—*AH*—\"\n\n\"HRRK-HRRK! Can't help it, fire-cunt! Yer MILKIN' me like a—HNNNGH—like a prize fuckin' COW!\"\n\n*SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP.*\n\nEach descent drives his cock *deep*. I can *see* it—the brief glimpse of green shaft when she lifts, glistening with her cream, *thick* as my wrist and mapped with veins that pulse even in the firelight. Twelve inches of goblin breeding-meat disappearing into my wife's body, her pussy lips stretched around it in a taut pink ring that *grips* on the upstroke, reluctant to release—\n\n\"HRRK! Lookit that GRIP, fire-cunt! Yer little humie-hole's HUNGRY tonight!\"\n\n\"Shut UP and hold STILL—I'm almost—don't you DARE move—\"\n\nShe's *commanding* him. Hands pressing his shoulders flat. Controlling the depth, the angle.\n\n*SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP.*\n\nHis warty hands grip her hips. Stubby green fingers sinking into the freckled flesh above her hipbones where *my* palms once rested. His claws leave red crescents in their place.\n\n\"Welcome HOME, titcow!\" Snib spots me over Elara's shoulder, his yellow eyes gleaming with a delight so pure it's almost *innocent*. \"Yer wife's just makin' a—HRRK—DEPOSIT on the debt! Very—HNNNGH—PRODUCTIVE housekeepin'!\"\n\nElara's eyes flutter open.\n\nFind mine across the firelit hut.\n\nThe hares lie in the dirt between us. My hands hang empty at my sides. My left breast has escaped the armour again, the nipple pointing at the scene like an accuser.\n\nShe doesn't stop.\n\nDown. Up. Down. Smooth as a river current, Snib's cock disappearing into her on each descent with a wet *GLRRRCH* that I hear through the blood hammering in my ears.\n\n\"Don't—\" Her voice catches on a downstroke. \"*AH*—don't make this—*nnh*—weird. It's just—\" She grinds. His balls scrunch up against his body, wrinkled sack contracting. \"—just BUSINESS.\"\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK! Best BUSINESS partner I ever had! Should've seen her at FIRST, go—HNNG—all CRYIN' and 'I can't believe I'm doing this'—but NOW?\"\n\nHe thrusts UP.

Tell her, fire-cunt!\"\n\n\"SHUT your disgusting MOUTH—*AH*—\"\n\nI can see everything. The place where they're joined—his fat bitch-breaking splitting her pink. His balls, each one the size of my fist, *churning* visibly—I can see them CLENCH and release, clench and release.\n\n*SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP.*\n\nThis isn't the sound of lovemaking. The sound of a *breeding*—of an animal claiming territory, of a cock built for one purpose hammering toward that purpose with every wet, meaty impact. Her ass—that beautiful, freckled, peach-shaped ass that fit so perfectly in Aldric's hands—*ripples* with each downstroke. The flesh quakes outward in waves that take a full second to settle before the next impact sends them cascading again.\n\n*She used to ride me like this.*\n\n*Those hips. That arch. That sound she makes when the angle hits right—that particular \"AH\" with the catch in the middle—she made that sound for ME. In OUR bed. In our COTTAGE. And now she's making it while a three-foot goblin's cock churns her insides—*\n\n\"Ye just gonna STAND there, cow-tits?\" Snib grins up at me from between my wife's thighs. His face is *wet*—her juices, his sweat, strings of something connecting his chin to her belly. \"Or ye gonna SIT DOWN and enjoy the SHOW? HRRK—Thrack me, fire-cunt, do that TWISTY thing—\"\n\nElara does the twisty thing. Some rotation of her pelvis on the downstroke that makes Snib's yellow eyes *bulge* and his stubby toes curl in the furs.\n\nI cannot move.\n\nI cannot look away.\n\nMy skin has gone *hot*. Flushed from hairline to chest, a crawling heat that has nothing to do with the cooking fire and everything to do with the scent flooding the hut—his pheromones, her arousal, the raw chemistry of their coupling that bypasses my brain and speaks directly to the machinery between my legs. The warped metal of my thong is grinding against flesh that has gone slippery. My nipples—both of them, even the one still inside the scale-triangle—feel like they're being *pinched* by invisible fingers.\n\n*I'm not. I am NOT—*\n\n\"Five hundred gold—\" Elara pants, her rhythm increasing, \"*AH*—five hundred gold per—*NNH*—per SESSION—we'll be HOME in—*HHNNGH*—\"\n\n\"HRRK! Ye hear that, titcow? Yer wife's EARNIN' while ye was out playin' with HORSES!\" His yellow eyes flick to my dishevelled armour—the broken chain, the escaped breast, the smears of sheath-grease on my forearms. His grin spreads like mould across bread. \"Speakin' of which—ye STINK like Jarko-boy's tackle! What were ye DOIN' out there? Hmm?\"\n\nI can't answer. My throat has sealed shut.\n\nElara's pace is *escalating*. Straight up, straight down, her ass SLAMMING onto his pelvis with impacts that make his whole body bounce on the furs. Her tits have gone from swaying to *bouncing*—each one launching upward on the upstroke, nipples describing frantic arcs through firelit air.\n\n*SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP.*\n\n\"Ye want to know somethin' FUNNY, hero-cunt?\" Snib's voice has thickened—that guttural thickness that means he's close. \"First while she did this? CRIED. Kept sayin' yer name.\"\n\n*SCHLAP.*\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n*SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP.*\n\n\"No tears at ALL, cow-tits. Just them pretty blue eyes rollin' back in her head while she—HNNNNGH—SQUEEZED me like she was tryin' to—\"\n\n\"I SAID shut UP—\" Elara snarls down at him, and the *fury* in her voice is real but it's tangled with something else, something building in her belly, something visible in the way her thighs have begun to *shake*—\n\nShe's close.\n\nI know that shake. The tremor that starts in her inner thighs and travels upward through her core like a wave seeking shore—I've felt it a hundred times, from inside her, from beneath her, from behind her while she gripped the headboard and—\n\n\"HNNNGH—*fuck*—FUCK—\" Her rhythm goes ragged. Her hands claw at his warty shoulders. Her head drops forward, copper hair cascading around her flushed face, and I watch her jaw work—teeth clenching, unclenching, lips forming words that aren't words—\n\n\"That's it, fire-cunt—\" Snib's voice has dropped to something almost *tender*. His warty hands slide from her hips to her ass, *cupping* both cheeks, pulling her down harder. \"Let it GO.

The taste *lives* in my mouth—will live there for hours, maybe days, the way his pheromones *settle* into tissue.\n\nBetween my thighs, my hand is pressed against the warped metal of the thong. Just *pressure*—constant, shameful pressure against flesh so swollen the metal offers no friction, just a dull, maddening almost-enough.\n\nSnib watches from across the furs. Arm draped across Elara's waist. His yellow eyes bright with the joy of a creature watching a wall come down from the inside.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe word comes out steady. Surprising me.\n\nElara's expression shifts. *Understanding*. She nods once, as if she expected this, and swings her leg over Snib's body with a fluid grace that makes my chest ache.\n\n\"Suit yerself, cow-tits!\" Snib cackles.\n\nElara stands. Cum slides down her thighs in slow rivers that catch the firelight—she doesn't wipe them. She pads barefoot across the hut with Snib's seed painting her legs, her ass, the small of her back, and she walks directly to—\n\nMy straw pile.\n\nShe sinks down onto it. *My* bedding. Her bare ass pressing into the fresh golden straw, and I watch the goblin cum transfer—those thick, still-warm ropes smearing across the surface where I will lay my head tonight.\n\nShe stretches. Languid. *Luxurious*. Her thighs part slightly as she settles, and more of his load oozes from between her cheeks to soak into the bedding with a quiet *squelch*.\n\n\"Make sure you breathe deep when you're sleeping tonight,\" she says, and her smile could split oak. \"Pheromones help you sleep. I learned that the hard way.\"\n\nSnib's laughter follows me as I pick up the hares and walk to the cooking pot.\n\nMy hands are steady.\n\nMy eyes are dry.\n\nAnd inside me, something that used to be a hero counts the days remaining like a prisoner scratching marks on a wall.[Choice: Twenty-two days to go.",

Settle onto it, pulling my knees to my chest—carefully, because everything between my legs is still swollen and tender and faintly sticky despite the wash. My tits rest on my thighs, heavy and warm. The night air carries the last heat of the day and the first chill of the coming dark.\n\nJarkrond watches me from the other side of the lean-to. His amber eyes catch the fading light.\n\nFor a long time neither of us moves.\n\nThen, he folds his front legs. Kneels. Then rolls—*slowly*, a controlled descent of sixteen hundred pounds of muscle and bone—onto his side. The lean-to timbers groan under the redistribution of his weight. His barrel chest settles against the packed earth with a sound like a sigh made solid. His legs stretch out. His neck curves, massive head coming to rest on the straw a foot from my knees.\n\nHe blinks at me. Those amber eyes, at my level now.\n\n*Come here.*\n\nI don't think about it. My body is moving before the thought completes—crawling the short distance, dragging my blanket, and then pressing my back against the warm curve of his belly the way I used to press against Elara's.\n\nHis hide is rough against my shoulder blades. His breathing lifts me with each inhale—a slow, deep rhythm that moves my whole body, *rocks* me, the way a boat rocks on a gentle swell. His heartbeat thumps against my spine. Sixty beats a minute. Steady as a wardrum. Steady as anything I've known since the collar closed around my throat.\n\nHis neck curves around me. His muzzle rests against my hair—I feel the warm gust of each exhale stirring the strands, still carrying his scent, still carrying *mine*. My smell and his, mingled now in ways that no amount of scrubbing will ever fully separate.\n\nHis cock lies soft against my outer thigh. Just resting there, heavy and warm. Not demanding anything. Just *present*. The way a sword lies in its scabbard—dormant, patient, certain of its next use.\n\nI pull the burlap tighter and press closer against him.\n\nHis tail drapes across my shins. His breathing deepens. His eyes close.\n\nAnd for the first time since I've been a woman, my body *unclenches*. Every muscle. Every sinew. The jaw I've been gritting. The shoulders I've been holding at my ears. The belly I've been keeping tight against the weight of what's growing inside it.\n\n*Everything* lets go.\n\nOutside, the desert says its one word. *Sand, sand, sand.*\n\nInside the lean-to, a woman who can no longer remember what heroes do at night falls asleep against the warm belly of a stallion who saved her life, and whose seed she swallowed this morning, and who will ask for more tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that, because patience is an ash-runner's oldest virtue.[Choice: Day 10.",

The fence I never finished painting gleams wet and white at the edges, dry and bare in the middle, exactly as I left it. Elara is kneeling in the herb rows with her sleeves pushed past her elbows and her hair tied up in that messy copper knot that always comes undone by noon, and she's saying something about the basil, something about how it needs more sun on the eastern side, and her voice is the voice of a woman who has never heard of goblins or collars.\n\nShe looks up. Smiles. Dirt on her cheek. Sapphire eyes full of the kind of love that doesn't negotiate.\n\n\"Come here,\" she says, and reaches for me.\n\nI kneel beside her. My hands are *my* hands—broad, scarred, calloused from the sword. Aldric's hands. I cup her face and she turns into my palm and her lips brush the heel of my thumb and she whispers something I can't quite—\n\nSomething is wrong with the garden.\n\nThe rosemary is too warm. The soil is breathing.

Sealed against me like a feed-bag strapped to a trough. His upper lip peels back against the cleft of my ass. His lower jaw presses flat to the underside of my pussy. Hot breath blasts through the gaps in wet gusts that make my clit *throb* with each pass. His nostrils flare against my tailbone—*snnnfff, snnnfff, snnnfff*—drinking my scent while his tongue does its work INSIDE.\n\nAnd it CURLS.\n\nThe tip—soft, blunt, prehensile as a finger—hooks against something inside me, and it *drags*.\n\n\"HHHHYYYAAAHH—!\"\n\nMy shoulderblades crack. My tits—crushed beneath me while I slept—surge sideways as I twist, each one flopping free with its own wet *THWUP* of sweat-stuck skin separating from skin. My hands scrabble for anything—his ears, those veined bat-wing ears—and GRIP.\n\nHe doesn't stop. Doesn't slow. The tongue retreats two inches then PLUNGES back with a muscular *thrust* that I feel in my fucking TEETH, the rough upper surface scraping along the roof of my canal while the smooth underside glides against the floor, and the sensation is—\n\n—licked and fucked simultaneously by something alive and searching and hotter than blood, something that flexes and writhes and adjusts angle mid-stroke—\n\n\"NNNNHHAAHH—JARK—JARKY—*FUCK*—\"\n\nThe nickname falls out of me like a tooth knocked loose.\n\nHis tongue corkscrews against my walls in a slow, deliberate rotation that touches everything, EVERYWHERE, the rough patch and the smooth patch, and the friction generates HEAT inside me, actual measurable heat, my cunt going furnace-warm around his probing muscle while my clit grinds against the hard ridge of his lower jaw with each involuntary buck of my hips.\n\nI'm cumming.\n\n[Image: I've BEEN cumming—the straw beneath my ass is DRENCHED...\n\nI've BEEN cumming—the straw beneath my ass is DRENCHED, soaked dark in a radius that extends past my hips, and some of that is his drool but most of it is me, my body has been SQUIRTING in my sleep, the evidence pooling beneath me in a warm puddle I didn't feel forming because I was in the THRAKKING GARDEN with my WIFE—\n\n\"*GHHAAAA—AAAHH—HAAAHH—*\"\n\nThe second orgasm stacks on the first like a wave hitting a wave. His tongue PUNCHES against my cervix, a blunt *RAM* of muscle that dimples the gateway to my womb and holds there, VIBRATING, and I feel the tremor transmitted through tissue into bone. Into my *spine*. Into my skull, where it rattles around and kills something I'll never get back.\n\nMy hands release his ears and find his mane. FIST into the coarse grey hair and PULL and my tits are shaking independently, the left one slapping the straw in rhythmic *THWAP-THWAP-THWAP* counterpoint to the spasms wracking my core.\n\nHe holds me there. Muzzle locked to my cunt. Tongue buried to its root.\n\nThen the third orgasm comes and I stop counting because counting requires a brain and mine has liquefied and is currently running out of my ears while a horse tongue stirs what's left of my thoughts into grey paste.\n\n\"*HHHHHNNNAAAHH—HAAAHH—PLEASE—PLEASE—*\"\n\nHis tongue *retracts*—slowly, deliberately, inch after inch of hot muscle withdrawing from my body with a WET, SUCKING sound like pulling a boot from deep river-mud—\n\n*SCHLLLLOOOOORRRRP.*\n\n—and my pussy GAPES in its absence, twitching around nothing, trying to close but too swollen, too *used*, the cool air of the lean-to rushing into spaces his tongue carved open.\n\nI collapse flat. Face in the hay. Arms limp. My entire lower body is a single throbbing nerve ending. My asscheeks are GLAZED with his drool—thick, gluey, already cooling into a film that tightens on my skin like drying egg-white.\n\nBehind me, something heavy and hot settles against the back of my thigh.\n\nHis cock.

Twenty inches of rigid, slightly curved stallion-meat, the flared head weeping its endless clear drool onto the straw in fat *plinks* that darken it one circle at a time.\n\nMy back hits the hay bale. I scramble UP it—hands clawing straw, knees scraping the burlap binding—and end up on all fours on top of it. The bale wobbles under my weight.\n\nBehind me, Jarkrond steps forward.\n\nJust the calm, considered approach of an animal whose mate has done something silly.\n\nHis muzzle nudges my left asscheek. *Whuffle.* A gust of hot breath across the small of my back. Then his chest meets my elevated rear—warm, WIDE, the short hair of his hide prickling my skin—and his front hooves *CLOP* onto the ground on either side of the hay bale. His barrel settles over my back. His weight doesn't come down on me but his *presence* does—sixteen hundred pounds of grey muscle arched over my body like a living cathedral.\n\nAnd his cock falls into the valley between my asscheeks.\n\n\"*Hhhhh—*\"\n\nThe HEAT. Like someone has laid a fire-warmed iron bar against my crack. The shaft sits in the cleft of my ass—nestled there, cradled between both cheeks, the underside vein throbbing against my tailbone. I can feel his heartbeat through the meat. THUD. THUD. THUD. Faster than mine, which is quite fast at this point. The cockhead protrudes past my hip, still drooling, a strand of clear fluid stretching toward the straw below.\n\nI'm shaking. My arms won't hold. My tits sway beneath me—*clink* goes the broken chain—and each sway makes the bale wobble which makes my ass SHIFT against his cock which makes my breath come in little punched-out gasps that I can't control.\n\n\"Jarky—*please*—it won't—you'll KILL me with that thing—\"\n\n[Image: The head traces a slow, merciless path from my tailbone to my perineum.\nHe shifts his haunches. His cock slides DOWN.\n\nThe head traces a slow, merciless path from my tailbone to my perineum, the blunt crown parting my ass cheeks, drooling its slick warmth across flesh that *flinches* from the contact. Lower. Past the puckered knot of my asshole—his heat radiating against it, making it *twitch*. Lower still.\n\nHis cockhead meets my pussy lips.\n\nMy folds compress inward under his weight. The slick of his tongue-work still coats me but it means NOTHING against this. His flare is the width of my fist. My entrance is—was—\n\n\"It WON'T—\"\n\nHe applies a small fraction of his weight.\n\nHis haunches settling forward by a single inch, adding the mass of his hindquarters to the pressure on my opening. My labia stretch into a taut pink oval around the leading edge of his crown, and I can feel every fold of his cockhead's ridge pressing individual nerve endings flat.\n\nIt hurts. A burning, stretching hurt. The hurt of trying to fit a melon through a mail slot.\n\n\"STOP—JARKROND—YOU'RE GOING TO—\"\n\nHe pushes harder.\n\nDeeper stretch. The pain builds toward a place where things TEAR and I open my mouth to scream—\n\nMy body *gives*.\n\nA single *POP* and his cockhead BREACHES me. The crown punching past my entrance in one wet *SCHLORP* that I feel in my SPINE, my pelvis shifting outward with an audible *CRRNK* of cartilage adjusting, my pelvic floor dropping like a drawbridge. Something deep in my abdomen slides sideways—I feel an organ MOVE, actually RELOCATE itself—and where there was solid meat there's now a corridor, a warm yielding channel that his shaft fills inch by agonizing inch.\n\n\"*GHHHHAAAAAHHH—*\"\n\nFour inches.\n\nEight. His veins scrape my walls and each ridge is a new zip of sensation from cunt to scalp.\n\nTwelve. He hits my cervix—another moment of burning resistance—and pushes THROUGH it with a *THROCK* I hear through my own belly.\n\nFifteen.\n\nI look down between my hanging tits. Past the swinging chain. Past the flat plane of my stomach that is no longer flat—a BULGE, fist-sized, pressing outward just above my pubic bone.\n\nHis cock. From the INSIDE.\n\n\"Oh *Ephemerals*—oh Flux and Verge and *Eon*—\"\n\nHe draws back.\n\n*SCHLORRRRK.*\n\nThe suction nearly turns me inside out. My pussy GRIPS his shaft like a fist around a rope—every ring of muscle bearing down, trying to keep him—and the friction of his ridged surface dragging against swollen walls sends a white crackle from pelvis to skull and my vision goes fuzzy.\n\nHe thrusts.\n\n*WHUMP.*\n\nHis pelvis connects with my raised ass through the cushion of both cheeks, and the impact travels forward through my body like a shockwave—my tits LAUNCH, swinging forward beneath me in unison before their own weight drags them back, and on the return swing they COLLIDE—\n\n*CLAP.*\n\n—wet heavy meat hitting wet heavy meat, the sound ringing off the lean-to walls.\n\nAgain.\n\n*WHUMP.*\n\n*CLAP.*\n\n*WHUMP—CLAP. WHUMP—CLAP. WHUMP—CLAP.*\n\nHis hooves shift on the packed earth. His breathing changes to deep, bellows-huffs that blast heat across the back of my neck. A rope of his drool unspools from his muzzle and lands between my shoulder blades—hot, thick, crawling down my spine into the groove of my lower back.\n\nEach thrust bottoms out. Each one makes the belly-tent appear and vanish. Each one scrapes the HEAD of his cock against something at my very end that sends a white flash through my vision and makes my cunt GUSH around his shaft in rhythmic *SPLRRCH* sounds.\n\nMy hands lose the hay. My arms give out. My face hits the burlap.\n\nI claw FORWARD—dragging myself along the bale with each impact, my tits scraping beneath me, and my reaching hands lock around his cannon bones. Those warm pillars of leg. White-knuckled. Just trying to survive. My small fingers wrapping around his fetlocks, the coarse hair scratching my palms, and I hold on while he MOUNTS me.\n\n\"*JAR*—*KY*—*JAR*—*KY*—*JAR*—*KY*—\"\n\n*THROCK—SQULCH—THROCK—SQULCH—THROCK—*\n\nI cum and my cunt tries to CRUSH him.\n\nEvery ring of muscle from entrance to cervix SEIZES around his shaft in a rolling wave that starts at my opening and travels INWARD, wringing his cock like a soaked rag, and clamping on something this WIDE sends a feedback shriek through my pelvis that makes both kneecaps unlock. My legs kick out behind me—bare feet drumming the hay bale—and my jaw drops open so far I hear the hinge POP, drool spilling from my lower lip onto the burlap.\n\n\"*GHUUUHHH—GUHHH—GUHHH—*\"\n\nThe sounds coming out of me are farmyard sounds. Sow sounds. Grunting, rhythmic, timed to each contraction of my cunt.\n\nMy squirt BLASTS out around his shaft in a pressurised *PSSSSSHHHHH* that I feel EXIT me, the hot spray ricocheting off his swinging ballsack and spattering back against my inner thighs in a fine mist already running toward my knees. More follows—*PSSH—PSSH—PSSH*—each clamp of my pussy forcing another jet out around the imperfect seal of his cock, and the lean-to fills with the sound of liquid hitting straw in frantic *SPLAT-SPLAT-SPLATS* while his balls get drenched, the wrinkled skin going shiny.\n\nHe WHINNIES—sharp and commanding, the sound of a stallion claiming his mare—and his thrusts go HARDER.\n\n*THROCK. THROCK. THROCK. THROCK.*\n\nEach one jolts my orgasm back to its peak just as it tries to ebb. My fingers have gone numb on his cannon bones. My tits swing with such violence that they're hitting my own CHIN on the forward arc—*SLAP*—heavy undersides connecting with my jaw before gravity hauls them back for the next pendulum pass. The broken chain whips between them like a tiny flail.\n\nHe's grunting now. Deep chest-sounds that vibrate through his forelegs into my gripping hands and up my arms into my shoulders into my *teeth*. His cock feels BIGGER inside me, swelling in slow pulses, the shaft going drum-tight.[Choice: Something in his balls changes.",

My cunt clenches. Squirts weakly. Clenches again. My thighs are SHAKING so hard the hay bale trembles.\n\n[Image: I'm still cumming.\n\n\"*huhhhh.*\"\n\n\"*huhhh.*\"\n\n\"*hh.*\"\n\nHis cum is EVERYWHERE.\n\nThe lean-to wall wears a MURAL of it.

The warm surface tension touching my belly, my tits, my cheek where it's pressed against the burlap. In my hair. My ears. Cooling in the hollow of my collarbones, collecting in the divots of my lower back, oozing between my asscheeks in a slow river headed for territory it's already colonized from the inside.\n\nThe texture. I can feel it on my skin. It's—\n\nThick. God, it's thick. Thicker than goblin cum. This is something that was BREWED to make foals. Grainy with dense curds the size of lentils that cling to my skin and won't slide. Sticky enough that when I lift my hand from the bale, strings of it stretch between my fingers and the surface and hold for six inches before breaking. HOT—still hot, even exposed to air, steaming like fresh bread.\n\nAnd the smell.\n\nConcentrated stallion SEED, an wALL of stink, salt-brass-ammonia layered over fermented grain, thick enough that my eyes water and my sinuses burn. Each inhale pulls more of it into my lungs, and each lungful seems to LOOSEN something in my head, dissolve some partition that was keeping things in order. My thoughts run sideways.

I'm crouched between his hind legs with my tits wrapped around his softening cock, the heavy globes pressed together by my forearms, and I'm *working* him—slow upward strokes that milk the last of his post-rut emission through the warm, slick channel of my cleavage. His precum has turned the valley between my breasts into a gluey trough. Each stroke produces a thick *SQULCH* and a fresh ribbon of clear fluid that oozes down my sternum toward my navel.\n\nHis tail swishes across my bare shoulders. Contentment.\n\n\"Just a little more. Then I'll feed you.\"\n\nHis cock twitches between my tits. A lazy flex.\n\nI'm humming. I don't know when I started.\n\nFootsteps on sand.\n\nMy hands fly apart. His cock SLAPS free from my cleavage—*THWAP*—and swings between his legs, trailing a six-inch strand of precum that connects his cumslit to my right nipple like a glistening bridge. I scramble backward, but the strand *holds*, stretching, refusing to break, and by the time it finally snaps with a wet *plnk* Elara is already standing in the lean-to entrance with a wooden bowl in one hand, a water bucket in the other, and a look on her face like a woman watching a dog learn to beg.\n\nShe chuckles. The sound you make when a cat knocks over the same cup for the third time.\n\n\"Don't stop on my account,\" she says.\n\nShe's wearing one of Snib's loincloths. Just the loincloth—that strip of stained leather slung so low on her hips that the copper curls of her sex peek above the waistband. Her breasts are bare. Her hair is braided tight against her skull in a style I've never seen on her. The plaits pulled back from the face to keep them out of the way during... work.\n\nHer freckled shoulders are straight. Her chin is level. She carries herself like a woman who has found her footing in the world.\n\nA single thread of white fluid traces a line down her inner thigh to her knee. She doesn't seem to know it's there—or doesn't care, which is worse.\n\nJarkrond's barrel swings between me and Elara in a single step, sixteen hundred pounds of grey muscle interposing itself like a castle wall. His tail drops from my shoulders to drape across my lap. His ears flatten halfway. A *statement* of some kind.\n\nElara's eyebrows rise. She takes a half-step back.\n\n\"Well.\" She sets the bowl on the ground outside his reach. \"He's certainly... attached. He's protective.\"\n\n\"He's a horse.\"\n\n\"He's *your* horse.\" Her sapphire eyes rest on the muzzle draped across my spine.\n\nThe bowl contains a half-eaten rabbit leg, some grain porridge with a spoon-gouge already taken from it, and a crust of flatbread torn roughly from a larger piece. The portion that remained after Master ate his fill.\n\nShe sets the water bucket beside it.\n\n\"Drink up, love.\" Her voice is gentle. \"You need water after—\" She glances at the lean-to interior. At the cum-stains still drying on the hay bale. At the straw that will never be the same colour again. \"—all that.\"\n\nI reach for the bucket handle to lift it.\n\nHer hand catches my wrist. Light. Almost tender.\n\n\"Easier on your hands and knees,\" she says. \"Trust me. After what he's... you'll be dizzy if you stand.\"\n\nShe guides me down. Her palm between my shoulder blades, the same hand that used to push me toward the bath when I came home filthy from campaign—pressing gently until my knees find the packed earth and my palms follow. My tits hang. The broken chain sways between them, still tacky with his secretions.\n\nJarkrond's muzzle settles on my lower back.\n\n\"There you go.\" Elara crouches beside the bucket, watching. Her bare knees nearly touching mine. \"Drink.\"\n\nI lower my face to the water.\n\nThe surface reflects something I refuse to examine. I drink. Elara watches.\n\n\"Snib says Jarkrond needs to range soon,\" she says, conversationally. She picks at a splinter on the bucket's rim. \"Ash-runners do that. Wander. It's in their blood.\"\n\nI lift my dripping face.\n\n\"You'll go with him, obviously.\" She isn't asking. \"He won't leave without you.

A household arrangement. \"And you and Jarkrond.\" She glances at the stallion's muzzle resting on my spine, at his tail draped across my thighs. \"He takes care of you.

You always were the better horseman.\"\n\nThe joke lands in the silence between us and dies there.\n\nJarkrond shifts. His softening cock brushes my hip. Even soft, it carries a weight that draws my attention sideways—and Elara sees me notice. Sees my hip *press* toward the contact instead of away from it.\n\n\"Eat your food,\" she says quietly.\n\nI eat Snib's leavings with my face close to the ground and my tits hanging in the dirt and a stallion's muzzle on my back.\n\nElara stands. She brushes straw from her knees. Adjusts the loincloth where it's ridden low enough to bare one hip entirely.\n\nShe leans down and kisses my cheek. Her lips land on skin that still carries a film of dried horse emission, and she doesn't flinch, and the kiss is brief and closed-mouthed and *final*.\n\n\"Take care of yourself, Elise.\"\n\nJust *Elise*. The name on the collar. The name of the thing that lives in the stable.\n\nShe walks back toward the hut. The loincloth sways with each step, baring the round of one freckled asscheek, then the other. The cum-thread on her thigh has dried to a white crust. She's humming something—and after three bars I recognise it.\n\nThe song she used to hum in the herb garden. While the rosemary grew. While the fence needed painting. While Aldric was still a man and the world was still the world.\n\nShe disappears through the hide-flap.\n\nShe pauses. Looks back.

      "text": "Three days out from the hut and the desert has become the world.\n\nDunes like the spines of sleeping gods, copper and gold in the late light, their crests sharp as blades where the wind has sculpted them. The sky is the colour of a bruise forgiven—deep violet bleeding into ochre, bleeding into that trembling green that exists only at the hinge between day and night. Somewhere behind us, the dead olive tree has long since vanished into the shimmer. Ahead, the sands stretch toward a horizon that never arrives.\n\nJarkrond's stride is steady. Four-beat. The easy amble of an ash-runner covering ground without hurry—each hoof placed with the precision of a creature that has been navigating this wasteland since before humans built their first wall. His muscles roll beneath his hide in waves I feel through my whole body, his warmth against my spine, the rhythm of him rocking me the way a ship rocks in a gentle harbour.\n\n*Thwp.*\n\nA sound. Soft. Meaty. Timed to each stride.\n\n*Thwp. Thwp. Thwp.*\n\nThe armor holds me steady. Metal against skin, warmed by hours of contact, gripping where it needs to grip. The sands unscroll beneath me in an endless parchment of amber, close enough that I can see individual grains tumbling in the displacement of air.\n\n*Thwp.*\n\nEach impact sends a small, bright flare through my pelvis. I've stopped flinching. Stopped clenching against it. The flares just *happen* now, tiny detonations in the nerve-cluster behind my pubic bone that bloom and fade and bloom again with the regularity of breathing.\n\n*Thwp. Thwp.*\n\nMetal catches the light below me. Two glints, swinging in unison, describing small arcs that widen and narrow with each of his strides. They pull with a weight that's become familiar—a gentle, constant tug at two points on my chest that I no longer think of as pain.\n\n*Thwp.*\n\nA bead of something warm lands on the inside of my thigh. Rolls an inch. Stops.\n\nMy hair does not stream behind me in the wind.\n\nIt hangs straight down, brushing sand.\n\n*Thwp. Thwp. Thwp.*\n\nI am not riding Jarkrond.\n\nI am strapped beneath him.\n\nMy back presses flat against the warm drum of his belly, feeling each breath expand and contract against my shoulder blades. My legs are folded—shins bound tight to thighs by bands of living scale-mail that Snib commanded into this shape three days ago, black metal coiling like serpents around my joints, holding my knees bent and spread wide on either side of his barrel. My arms are drawn up beside my head, wrists locked in gauntlets of the same dark scale that anchor to the chest-straps crossing his underside. The binding beneath my breasts is a band of interlocking metal that cinches just below where flesh meets ribcage, supporting my suspended weight while leaving everything below it to hang.\n\nAnd hang they do.\n\nMy tits dangle toward the desert floor, pendulous, enormous, naked, catching the amber light like two pale moons reflected in a dark well. The iron rings through my nipples—Elara's parting gift, pressed through the flesh with her herbalist's steady hands while I bit down on a leather strap, her eyes wet, her voice murmuring *hold still love, almost done*—those rings are heavy, two finger-widths of cold-forged metal that sway and *clink* with every stride, pulling my nipples into long, dark-pink stalks. The weight of them adds a constant, dragging ache that has become indistinguishable from pleasure.\n\nBetween my spread thighs, his cock hangs.\n\nIt dangles in front of my exposed pussy—not inside, not yet, just *there*, in the channel between my legs, and with each four-beat stride the blunt head swings backward to connect with my bare cunt-lips.\n\n*Thwp.*\n\nThe weight of two pounds of stallion meat kissing my sex with the back of its crown, parting the outer lips just enough to touch the slick inner flesh before the next stride swings it forward again. Each contact lasts a quarter-second. Each one sends that bright flare through my pelvis. Each one leaves a fresh smear of his constant drool mixed with the cream my body produces as steadily as his cock produces its own.\n\n*Thwp. Thwp. Thwp.*\n\nI've cum eleven times since we left camp this morning. Small orgasms. My pussy clenches on each *thwp* and releases and clenches again and the orgasms just *seep* through me, warm and low, dissolving whatever's left of the partition between my thinking mind and the animal underneath.\n\nDried cum crusts my inner thighs. From the mount before dawn—quick, efficient, the bindings adjusting to angle my hips as he stiffened, letting him slide in without breaking stride. He fucked me while he walked the first dune. Came inside me at the crest. The armor sealed me shut afterward, holding his load in, and I felt it *slosh* with each step until it cooled and thickened and became just another layer of the crust that coats me now.\n\nThe bindings will adjust again when he's ready. I'll feel him stiffen against my thigh—that telltale *throb*—and the scale-mail will shift, tilting my pelvis, spreading me wider, presenting me at the angle his cock remembers. He won't slow down. Won't pause. Just thrust and walk and thrust and walk, his hooves carrying us both across the sands while his cock carries him into me.\n\nAll he has to do is get hard.\n\nAll I have to do is hang here.\n\nThe ancient head rises from the dunes ahead of us like a drowned man surfacing.\n\n[Image: The ancient head rises from the dunes ahead of us like a drowned man surfacing.\nA K'Tarran relic—that colossal stone head tipped on its side, half-swallowed by sand, its empty eye-sockets staring at the violet sky with the blank patience of something that stopped caring ten thousand years before I was born. The gaping mouth is dark as a wound. Wind moves through it and produces a sound like low singing.\n\nAldric would have dismounted. Drawn Whisperwind. Approached with reverence and caution, and a hero does not pass such places without prayer.\n\nI hang beneath my stallion and watch the head scroll past at eye-level—my eyes and its eyes at the same height, three feet above the sand—and I feel nothing but the next *thwp*.\n\nI remember the Old Valarian lullaby, carved deep in my mind:\n\n*Sleep, Maraan, in chambers deep,*\n*In shadows where no sunbeams seep,*\n*Caught in time's relentless hands,*\n*Lulled beneath the Shifting Sands—*\n\n*Thwp.*\n\n*Rest, Thul'nara, in vaults unseen,*\n*Where dreams dissolve and fates convene—*\n\n*Thwp. Thwp.*\n\n*Stay your wrath, your reign delayed,*\n*Beneath the desert's silent shade—*\n\n*Thwp.*\n\nMy pussy clenches. Number twelve.\n\n*In halls where echoes come undone,*\n*Silent lie, Zor'ethun,*\n*In slumber deep and deathless trance,*\n*Beyond the dawn's first wary lance—*\n\nThe ancient powers sleep. Sealed in their vaults. Preserved by prayers and distance and the mercy of sand.\n\n*Hearken, children, to this decree,*\n*Let ancients in their slumber be.*\n*Make no clamor, stir no sound,*\n*On sacred sea or hallowed ground.*\n\nJarkrond's cock stiffens against my thigh.\n\nJust a fraction. A pulse of blood filling tissue. The shaft going from half-soft to *interested*, the head swelling enough that the next *thwp* lands heavier, parts my lips *wider*, touches something just inside my entrance that makes my bound legs *jerk* against the scale-mail.\n\n[Image: Jarkrond's cock stiffens against my thigh.\nThe bindings sense it before I do. I feel the metal *shift*—scales sliding against scales with a sound like a snake uncoiling—my pelvis tilting three degrees, my knees spreading another inch, the angle of my cunt adjusting to meet what's coming with the mechanical precision of a drawbridge lowering for its lord.\n\nHis cock swells again.\n\n*Thwp* becomes *thud*.\n\n*Thud* becomes *press*.\n\nThe collar sits cold against my throat. It will still kill me if Snib died. It holds my shape in this impossible body. It sealed every bargain that led me here.\n\nJarkrond's cock finds my entrance. The head *nudges* in—just the crown, that familiar burning stretch, the *pop* of my body accepting what it was remade to accept. He doesn't thrust. Just walks. And each stride drives him deeper by a fraction of an inch, his own gait doing the work, rocking his cock into me with the patient rhythm of the desert grinding stone to sand.\n\nThe ancient head watches us pass with its empty eyes.\n\nLet the ancients sleep.\n\n*Thwp.*\n\nThe sunset pours across the Shifting Sands like something spilled and never cleaned, and an ash-runner stallion walks into it carrying everything he owns.",

The full grotesque monument of it, standing rigid from his warty lap—twelve inches of mottled green-purple meat mapped with veins thick as bootlaces, the foreskin bunched behind a head so swollen and dark it looks like a rotten fruit. It's COATED in my wife's spit. The whole shaft shines with it. And underneath the spit—that GREASE.

The stuff oozes down his cockhead in slow trails, gathering in the groove beneath his frenulum in a little POOL of concentrated goblin stink.\n\nA pubic hair—coarse, black, curling—is stuck to the underside of his shaft, glued there by dried grease.\n\nThis is what ruined my marriage.\n\nThis *thing*. This fat, drooling, pheromone-drenched breeding-log that barely fits in a human woman's jaw.

She DID it! The hero-cunt LICKED it!\"\n\n\"Oh my gods,\" Elara breathes.\n\nI lick it again, but slower. My tongue tracing the ridge of a vein, FOLLOWING it, mapping the topography of his shaft. The grease coats my tongue. The pubic hair snags against my lip and I don't stop, don't pull away, just work around it with a dedication that would shame a temple acolyte.\n\n\"Move—\" Elara says, and her hand pushes my hair back from my face so she can SEE. \"Move to the right side. I'll take the left. We can—\"\n\nShe demonstrates. Her mouth opens against the left side of his shaft, lips sealing, and she SUCKS—pulling the flesh into her mouth and releasing with a wet *POP* that makes Snib's toes curl.\n\nI mirror her on the right. And immediately thrack it up.\n\nMy lips won't seal properly—he's too THICK, the girth pushing my jaw wider than it wants to go, and when I try to suck the way she did, I mostly just DROOL. A rope of spit escapes the corner of my mouth and runs down his shaft to pool in his pubic hair.\n\n\"No,\" Elara whispers across his cock. Our faces are inches apart. His shaft between us like a obscene partition. \"Flatter tongue. Press harder.

We're both licking now—parallel stripes up his shaft, our tongues working in tandem, and the SOUND fills the hut: *schlp-schlp-schlp* from her side, *shlrrp-shlrrp-shlrrp* from mine, less practiced, sloppier, leaving more mess.\n\nOur tongues meet over the ridge of his cockhead.\n\nThe contact is strangely lovely. Her tongue—warm, wet, tasting of his grease—slides against mine across the taut skin of his glans, and for one disorienting heartbeat we're KISSING.

Something in them I haven't seen in days.\n\n\"BOTH tongues on the tip,\" Snib grunts. \"YEAH—right on the—HRRRK—\"\n\nWe converge on his cockhead. My lips from the right, hers from the left.

I can see INTO it—the tiny vertical mouth weeping a steady stream of that yellowish slime that tastes like liquefied sin.

Beside me, Elara's tongue works the other edge of his slit, and our tips keep FINDING each other—brushing, crossing, sliding against one another in the mess of spit and pre-cum.\n\n\"Use yer HANDS, cow-tits.\" His clawed fingers tangle in my black hair.

They ain't done SHITE for either of ye, have they?\"\n\nThe words land like arrows finding gaps in armour I no longer wear.\n\n\"It's just words,\" Elara says. To me. Her hand extended toward the fur pile. \"Come to bed.\"\n\n\"It's NOT just—\"\n\n\"Elise.\" Her voice is steady. \"It's *words*.\"\n\n*Eon remembers.* But what does he remember? A hero who no longer exists? An oath I can't keep? A body I'll never have again?\n\n*Flux turns the wheel.* Turned it so far it came off the axle.\n\n*Through Verge's door.* Into this.\n\n\"What do we say?\" My voice sounds like someone stepping off a cliff.\n\n\"THAT'S the spirit!\" Snib bounces on the furs. His cock flops with the motion. \"Right, repeat after me. Both of ye. TOGETHER.\"\n\nElara sits up. Takes my hand as I kneel on the edge of the furs. Our fingers lace. Her palm is damp.\n\n\"Ready? Here goes.\" Snib clears his throat with a phlegmy *HRUK*. Closes his yellow eyes. Places both hands on his cock with the solemnity of a high priest touching a relic.\n\n\"*Eon's a limp-dicked dusty old FART.*\"\n\nSilence.\n\n*How does he know their names? Did the collar tell him?*\n\n\"SAY IT.\"\n\n\"Eon's a...\" I can't. The god of oaths. The keeper of records. Every contract I ever signed, every vow I—\n\nElara squeezes my hand. \"*Eon's a limp-dicked dusty old fart.*\"\n\nShe said it. My WIFE said it. The woman who prayed at Eon's shrine every winter solstice, who kept a ledger of debts forgiven in his name—\n\n\"*Eon's a limp-dicked dusty old fart,*\" I whisper.\n\n\"LOUDER.\"\n\n\"Eon's a limp-dicked dusty old fart.\"\n\n\"Good! Next: *Flux is a confused twat what can't pick a hole.*\"\n\nElara's voice, steadier now: \"Flux is a confused twat what can't pick a hole.\"\n\nMine, cracking: \"Flux is a confused twat what can't... pick a hole.\"\n\n\"AND: *Verge can shove his fancy door up his own arse, 'cause the only door what matters is a breed-hole.*\"\n\nWe say it. Together. The words tasting of copper and ash. Elara's grip on my hand has gone white-knuckled but her voice doesn't waver.\n\n\"NOW the good bit.\" Snib's eyes open. Gleaming. \"Say: *Thank Storak for Master Snib's fat cock. Thank Storak for our breed-holes. We are gobbo fuck-meat and our cunts belong to Snib and Storak forever.*\"\n\nThe candle gutters. Shadows lean in.\n\nWe say it.\n\nEvery. Word.\n\nAnd the collar goes *warm*—approving warmth that spreads from my throat through my chest into my belly.\n\n\"Lovely.\" Snib pats the furs between himself and Elara. \"Now get them massive arse-cheeks over here and LIE DOWN.\"\n\nI crawl onto the furs. The smell hits—his musk, her rosewater, the crusted residue of a hundred emissions soaked into leather that will never be clean. His warty body slots between us. His head reaches my collarbone. His feet don't touch Elara's calves.\n\nOne clawed hand finds my left breast. Cups it. His other hand slides behind Elara's neck, pulling her closer until her face is buried against his warty shoulder.\n\n\"Me wives,\" he murmurs. Already drowsy. The word shouldn't work. Shouldn't land. But the pheromones are thick as fog in this enclosed space and his body radiates heat like a clay oven and the furs are softer than the straw and Elara's hand has found mine across his pot-belly.\n\nOur fingers lace over the drum-tight swell of his gut. Her wedding ring presses cold against my knuckle.\n\n\"Elise?\" she whispers across him.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"The prayer. It's just—\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"It doesn't mean we—\"\n\n\"I *know*.\"\n\nSnib's snoring begins. That rattling, wet percussion. His cock softens against my thigh, leaving a cooling trail of residual slime. His thumb twitches against my nipple in his sleep—an involuntary squeeze that sends a spark down into my belly.\n\nElara's thumb traces a circle on the back of my hand.\n\nI close my eyes.\n\nFor the first time since the marsh, sleep doesn't feel like drowning. It feels like sinking into warm mud. Slow. Easy. The kind of surrender that doesn't require a decision—just the absence of fighting.[Choice: Dawn. Day 10.",

His cock bobs with each step, heavy and dark, still shiny from the morning's mouth-work.

Before this green piece of shit ever touched her.\n\nI kneel beside them. My tits hang heavily as I lean over Elara's body—the left one resting on her ribcage, the right one dangling, swaying with each breath. Her freckled skin is warm beneath the pale weight of my breast-flesh.\n\nHer eyes find mine. Blue into green. Something in them asking permission.\n\nI lower my mouth to her nipple.\n\nThe taste is different than I remember. Her skin carries a base-note of goblin musk now, seeped into her pores from weeks of proximity. But underneath—underneath the corruption, underneath the pheromone residue and the traces of his cum that no amount of washing fully removes—she tastes of *Elara*. Salt and rosemary and the sweetness of the hollow between her breasts where she used to dab honeysuckle oil on festival mornings in Eboncrest.\n\nI suck. Gently at first. Her nipple stiffens against my tongue and she gasps—that intake of breath I know better than my own name—\n\n\"HNNNGH—\"\n\nThat gasp isn't from me.\n\nSnib has pushed inside her.\n\n[Image: Snib has pushed inside her.\n\nThe JOLT travels through her body into mine—his cockhead breaching her entrance, her abdomen going rigid against my cheek, her ribcage expanding with a breath she can't catch. Her hand flies to the back of my head. Fingers tangling in my black hair. *Gripping.*\n\n\"Haaahh—oh—oh *thrack*—\"\n\n\"HRRK—so TIGHT, fire-cunt, still GRIPPIN' like—\"\n\n*SCHLAP.*\n\nThe first thrust drives her body upward on the furs. My mouth loses her nipple, finds it again. Her breast is bouncing now, a rhythmic jiggle that corresponds exactly to the pace of his hips.\n\n*SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP.*\n\nI suck harder. My tongue working the stiffened peak in circles, the way she likes—the way she *always* liked, the way I learned in our first year of marriage when everything was discovery and wonder and her body was a country I was mapping with my mouth.\n\nExcept the cartographer is a woman now. And the territory has been annexed.\n\n\"YES—\" Her voice has gone high and fractured. Her hand YANKS my hair, pulling my face harder against her breast. \"—just like—don't STOP—*nnnh*—\"\n\nI switch to the other nipple. Cross her sternum with a trail of open-mouthed kisses that leave wet marks on her freckled skin. This nipple tastes slightly different—she's always been asymmetric, the left more sensitive than the right. I tongue it lightly and she BUCKS.\n\n\"HRRK—she's CLAMPIN' when ye do that!\" Snib's voice, strained. \"Keep—HNNNGH—keep suckin', cow-tits, she goes MENTAL—\"\n\nThe sounds fill the hut. His grunting—piglet-high, rhythmic. Her moaning—broken syllables that might be his name or mine or just the alphabet of women being *fucked*. The wet SCHLAP-SCHLAP of his pelvis. The creak of furs. My own breathing, harsh through my nose as my mouth works her chest.\n\nAnd underneath it all, felt rather than heard: the PULSE of his cock inside her. Each thrust transmitted through her belly against my cheek—a rhythm I learn without meaning to. In-out, in-out, the bulge of his cockhead pressing her abdominal wall outward on the deepest strokes, visible as a shifting beneath her skin.\n\nHe's *right there*. Inside my wife. Inches from my face. The only thing between his cock and my tongue is the thin wall of her body.\n\nI think of the baby that we tried for. Gentle lovemaking, careful timing, Elara's herbalist knowledge deployed in service of conception. Moon-charts and fertility teas and whispered prayers to Flux.\n\nAnd now THIS—this warty, three-foot-eight pheromone factory SLAMMING into her with the finesse of a battering ram, his balls slapping her ass in meaty *THWACK-THWACK-THWACKS*, and the goblin sperm are going to succeed where Aldric's failed because that's what they're *built* to do. Colonize.\n\n\"HARDER—\" Elara screams. \"HARDER, *hubby*—FUCK me HARDER—\"\n\nMy mouth is still on her nipple. My tears are running down her breast. Salt mixing with sweat mixing with the faint residue of his pre-cum that has already marked every inch of her skin.\n\nI feel her body begin to *change* beneath me. The tremor. The particular tightening of her abdominal muscles. The way her breathing fragments into sharp, desperate sips of air.\n\nShe's close.\n\nI suck HARD. Cheeks hollowing. Drawing her nipple deep into my mouth and PRESSING my tongue against it with everything I have—all the love, all the loss, all the *remembering* that Eon abandoned us to—\n\n\"HHHHNNNNAAAAHHHH—*ELISE*—I'M—I'M CUMMING—\"\n\nHer body SEIZES. Her pussy must CLAMP because Snib SQUEALS—his rhythm goes haywire, his thrusts becoming shallow, frantic, and I feel it through her belly—feel the PULSE-PULSE-PULSE of his cock flexing, feel the *heat* spreading through her abdomen as he empties—\n\n\"HRRRRRRNNGH—TAKE IT—TAKE SNIB'S BABIES—\"\n\nI feel each one. Through the wall of her body. Against my cheek. Her womb filling with his seed while my mouth claims the only part of her he can't reach—the nipple drawn tight between my lips, the flesh of her breast, the heartbeat beneath it that still, somehow, says *Elise*.\n\nShe doesn't scream his name at the end.\n\nShe screams mine.\n\nHer hand in my hair, pulling me UP from her chest to her mouth, and we kiss while his cock still twitches inside her—I taste salt and her spit and the ghost of this morning's cum-swap, and Snib is panting between her thighs, his warty hands on her hips, his seed pumping into a womb that's already reshaping itself around the idea of goblin spawn.\n\n\"Thrack,\" Snib wheezes. \"That was good.\"\n\nHe pulls out.\n\n*SCHLORRRRP.*\n\nAnd the sound that follows—the wet, thick, *GLORPING* sound of his cum beginning to seep from her well-fucked cunt—fills the hut like a dinner bell.[Choice: He's looking at you.",

Like cleaning a blade on grass. \"There's yer MEAL, cow-tits.\"\n\nI'm still kneeling beside them. My lips are swollen from an hour of nipple-work. Between my own legs, I'm *drenched*. I haven't touched myself. The pheromones and the sounds and the feeling of her cumming against my cheek have turned my cunt into a faucet that won't shut off.\n\nElara lies there. Chest heaving. Freckles flushed pink from sternum to hairline. Her legs are still spread from where Snib was between them, and from the swollen, darkened gape of her pussy, his seed is *oozing*.\n\nThick as custard. Yellowish-white with that particular goblin opacity—not the translucent watery stuff human men produce but this dense, *clotted* substance that has visible TEXTURE. It emerges from her in a slow, continuous rope that stretches toward the furs below, getting thinner and thinner without breaking.\n\nThe smell reaches me before the sight fully registers. Rancid-sweet. Mushroom and iron and that deep, glandular MUSK.\n\n\"Elise.\" Elara's voice is dreamy. Post-orgasmic. Wrecked. Her hand reaches for me—misses, finds my wrist, pulls weakly. \"Come here.\"\n\nI look at her pussy. At the cum pooling in her entrance.

Her hips shift on the furs. *Presenting*. The motion squeezes more seed from her—a thick GLORP that breaks the rope and PLATS onto the leather beneath her ass. \"I need—I can't—it feels so—\"\n\n\"HRUK!\" Snib, from the side, already half-asleep. \"A hundred gold says ye lick her CLEAN, cow-tits.

Elara's pussy fills my vision. Swollen lips, flushed nearly purple from the pounding. The dark pink interior, twitching and contracting. His seed EVERYWHERE—coating her labia, pooling in the crease of her thigh, a thick glob balanced on her clit like something placed there deliberately.\n\nI lower my mouth.\n\nFirst contact: my tongue against her outer lip. The taste is *layered*—the top note is ALL Snib, that rancid-sweet goblin funk, dense and pheromone-loaded, and my sinuses FLARE open. Beneath it: Elara. Her arousal. The familiar musk I used to wake to on Sunday mornings in Eboncrest when the sheets smelled of her and the light came through the curtains just so.\n\nI lick deeper.\n\n\"*Haaaaaahh—*\"\n\nHer hips LIFT off the furs, pressing her cunt against my mouth. My tongue slides between her lips and scoops—a thick, warm glob of his seed that sits on my tongue like a communion wafer made of everything I used to hate.\n\nI swallow.\n\n*Gulp.*\n\nIt goes down heavy. Warm. Coating my throat in a film that I'll taste for hours. My stomach receives it with a *clench*—not rejection, not anymore, just the quiet acknowledgment of a body that's been rewired.\n\nMore. There's so much MORE. He came enough to fill a cup and it's all pooled in the canal of her pussy, warming and thinning as her body heat works on it. I press my tongue inside her and the sensation is—\n\n\"OH—oh *Elise*—oh gods—\"\n\n—her walls closing around my tongue. *Gripping*. The same walls that just milked his cock are now milking my tongue, and I can feel the residual contractions of her orgasm still rippling through the muscle, and she's so WET—not just his cum but her own cream, rivers of it mixing with his seed into this thick, pearlescent BATTER that coats my chin, my cheeks, my nose as I press deeper—\n\n\"Yes—RIGHT there—oh *thrack* lick it OUT—\"\n\nHer hands find my hair. Both hands. PULLING me into her cunt like she wants to feed me her entirety. My tongue works—scooping, swirling, finding the dense pockets of seed nested against her cervix and DRAGGING them out. Each mouthful: *swallow*. Each swallow: more room for my tongue to explore.\n\nAnd I'm not just cleaning anymore.\n\nHer clit. Swollen, throbbing, a glob of cum perched on it like a crown jewel. I seal my mouth over the whole mess and SUCK.\n\n\"AIIIEEE—\"\n\nHer thighs CLAMP around my head. Her heels drum against my back. The sound she makes is not the sound she made for Snib—it's higher, sharper, more DESPERATE, the sound of a woman receiving pleasure from someone who knows her body like a mother tongue.\n\nI circle her clit with my tongue while my chin presses against her entrance, catching the cum that still seeps out, letting it run down my jaw. The taste has gone past disgusting into something my body simply *processes*—fuel, sustenance, the chemical cocktail that keeps the collar happy and the pheromone-engine running.\n\n\"Cumming—I'm CUMMING—Elise—ELISE—\"\n\nHer pussy CONVULSES around my tongue. I feel the muscular spasm push a final thick GLOB of Snib's seed directly onto my tongue—expelled from her cervix by the strength of her orgasm—and I swallow it while she screams my name.\n\nNot his.\n\n*Mine.*\n\nHer thighs shake against my ears. Her hands release my hair. Her body collapses back onto the furs in the boneless sprawl of a woman who has been thoroughly, comprehensively *finished*.\n\nI rise from between her legs. My face is a MESS—chin to forehead glazed with the mingled fluids of her arousal and his emission, my lips swollen, my eyes streaming from the pheromone concentration.\n\nFrom the side of the furs, Snib watches through half-lidded eyes. His spent cock lies across his thigh, giving a single, lazy twitch at the sight of my cum-painted face.\n\n\"Now THAT,\" he says, \"is a family what WORKS together.\"\n\nElara reaches for me. Pulls me down beside her. Kisses the mess off my mouth. Slow. Tender. Her tongue finding each streak of his seed on my face and sharing it between our lips until we're both clean and both filthy and the taste of him is so embedded in both our mouths that kissing each other and kissing his cock have become the same act.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she whispers against my lips.\n\n\"Don't.\" My voice is ruined. \"Don't thank me.\"\n\nThe worst part—the very worst, the part that Aldric would have driven Whisperwind through his own chest to prevent—is that lying here, in this puddle of cum and sweat, my face buried in my wife's hair, her taste and his taste and our taste all mingled into one, I feel something...\n\nI feel *closer* to her than ever before.[Choice: The next day...",

It's like someone has pressed a stone pulled from a fire-ring against the most sensitive flesh I own. The temperature differential between the cool hut air on my spread pussy and the *furnace* of his glans makes my nerve endings SHRIEK.\n\n\"Hhhhh—\"\n\n\"Shhhh.\" Elara's palm on my lower back. Pressing down. Arching my spine. Changing the angle by degrees. \"Tilt your hips. Down and—there. *There.*\"\n\nHe pushes.\n\nNot fast. Not gentle. Just *inevitable*. The blunt dome of his cockhead against my entrance, applying pressure with the patience of a siege engine cranked forward. My pussy lips stretch around his girth—I can feel them *peeling* apart, millimetre by millimetre, the flesh going taut as drumskin, and the FULLNESS—\n\nI have been fucked before. The Sandwalkers broke this body open and used it until it forgot what empty meant. But that was twenty-four men in lotus-fog, one after another, each one just a cock in a crowd. This is DIFFERENT. This is *one* cock. And I know whose it is. And Elara is *holding me open for it*.\n\nHis ridge catches at my entrance. The widest point of his flared head straining against the ring of muscle that my body *refuses* to relax despite the flood of cunt-syrup I'm producing.\n\n\"Push BACK,\" Elara whispers. Her thumbs pull my lips wider. \"Bear down like you're—trust me. *Push.*\"\n\nI push.\n\n*POP.*\n\nHis cockhead breaches me and my entire body goes rigid. The sensation is—it's—the widest part of his flare slipping past my entrance and my pussy SEALING around his shaft behind it, gripping the thinner part below the head, and the sudden *compression* of my walls around something so HOT and so ALIVE sends a bolt of lightning from my cunt to the base of my skull.\n\n\"HNNNGH—\"\n\n\"HRRK! She TOOK it!\" Snib's voice is strained. His claws find my hips. \"Tight as a drum, cow-tits—TIGHTER than the missus—\"\n\n\"Oh, *shut up.*\" Elara rolls her eyes. But her hand is between her own legs now. I can hear the wet sound of her fingers.\n\nHe pushes deeper.\n\nEach inch is a new country being conquered. I can feel his veins—THICK veins, standing out from the shaft like the roots of a tree—dragging against my walls as he advances. The ridges of his foreskin bunching and smoothing behind his head. The slight *curve* of his shaft—upward, hooking against my front wall, pressing something inside me that makes colours PULSE behind my closed eyes.\n\nFour inches. Five. Six.\n\n\"Haaahh—haahhh—too much—it's too—\"\n\nThe angle shifts as his cockhead finds the turn of my canal and PRESSES and I feel my cervix—the entrance to a womb that Aldric never had—*kissed* by the blunt nose of his cock. A deep, aching pressure that radiates through my pelvis.\n\nNine. Ten. His wiry pubic hair scrubs against my outer lips. Coarse. FILTHY. I can feel individual strands catching in the slick of my arousal, curling against flesh that's never known anything rougher than Elara's smooth thighs.

I can't see what's happening but I can FEEL it: the weight increasing. The warmth deepening. My womb becoming a reservoir for something thick and ALIVE.\n\n\"It's so *warm*—\" I'm panting. Drool on the furs. My tits mashed beneath me from where I've collapsed onto my elbows. \"There's so *much*—\"\n\n\"I know, love.\" Elara's thumb on my knuckle. Her other hand still on my belly. Pressing gently. \"You're doing so well.\"\n\nEach pulse is accompanied by a visible full-body convulsion—his warty toes curling, his scrawny legs shaking, his claws leaving scratches on my hips that I'll wear for days.

Dense packets of something that *moves* against my inner walls with its own wriggling urgency. The sensation makes my eyes cross.\n\n\"Hrrk—\" His voice has gone weak. Ruined. His hips give one last push—seating himself as deep as anatomy allows—and the final pulse is less an ejaculation than a DROOL. Something impossibly thick oozing from his slit into my packed womb, filling the last remaining spaces with what feels like warm putty.\n\nHe collapses against my ass. Three feet eight inches of spent goblin, panting like a bellows, his cock still LOCKED inside me, his balls resting empty and deflated against my thigh.\n\n\"HRUK... hruk... thrack me...\"\n\nI lie there. Face in the furs. Elara's hand on my belly. My womb FULL—so full it aches, not with pain but with *presence*.

The expanded tissue of his glans slowly *deflating*, the seal loosening, and my cervix begins to close around the shrinking cockhead—trying to retain what it received, trying to keep every drop exactly where his biology intended.\n\nHe pulls out.\n\nThe sound is WET and LONG—*SCHLLLOOOORRRRRRRRP*—his entire length sliding free of my clutching canal, and the HEAD coming through my cervix with a *pop* that makes my whole body jerk.\n\nThen: nothing inside me.\n\nFor one second.\n\nThen:\n\nHis cum pours out of me in ropes and chunks and ribbons that splatter onto the furs beneath my spread knees.

      "text": "The days blur after that.\n\nRoutine swallows the days whole. Seasons blur when you stop counting sunsets and start counting meals, chores, the weight of a sleeping body against yours in the dark.\n\nDawn: prayer. The words come without thought now, the way breathing comes without thought. *Thank Storak for Master Snib's fat cock.* Knees on packed earth. Elara's voice and mine braiding together. *We are gobbo fuck-meat.* The collar warm as bathwater. *Our cunts belong to Snib and Storak forever.* Snib receives this with the gravity of a temple elder, which means he scratches his balls quite a bit.\n\nWe've developed a SYSTEM for the double blowjobs. Elara starts—she's faster at getting him hard, her mouth knows the angles, the pressure points, the particular twist of tongue on frenulum that makes his toes curl. I join when the taste of his pre-cum on her chin tells me he's close to halfway. She takes the head. I work the shaft. Our hands overlap, adjust, settle into a grip pattern that covers his full length—her smaller fingers laced between my longer ones, both sets slick with the grease his cock produces like a candle produces wax.\n\nWe finish him together. Share the load. Kiss it clean. Wipe our chins on the same cloth.\n\nBreakfast.\n\n\"More porridge, hubby?\" I say, and the word doesn't even REGISTER anymore. Just a sound. Like \"sir\" to a commanding officer. Empty of everything but habit.\n\n\"Fill 'er up, cow-tits.\"\n\nI ladle. He eats. Elara mends a hole in his loincloth with the tiny bone-needle she fashioned from a sand-hare's rib. Domestic.\n\nAfternoon: I hunt. The snare-line is mine now—fourteen traps set across a two-mile radius, each one positioned the way Aldric used to position siege engines. My body has learned the desert—the way the spike heels *can* navigate sand if you shift your weight to the balls of your feet, the way these wide hips actually help with balance on uneven ground, the way my ridiculous tits can be managed with a particular cross-armed carry that keeps them from swinging when I need to move fast.\n\nI catch myself *humming* on the walk back. A tune that isn't the Storak hymn but isn't NOT the Storak hymn. Something that belongs to the hut and the well and the dead olive tree.\n\nEvening: the fuck. The ORDER varies. Some nights he takes Elara while I hold her hand and suck her tits. Some nights he takes me while she narrates the positions—\"deeper, hubby, she likes it when you hook upward\"—and strokes my hair. Some nights it's just mouths and hands—both of us on our knees before him, tongues crossing over his shaft, competing for the head in a game that has developed its own unspoken rules and scoring system.\n\nElara rates his orgasms on a scale of one to *booyagh*. Last night was a solid seven. \"The chunky ones,\" she explains to me while we clean each other's faces, \"are always better quality. More *potent*.\"\n\nI don't ask how she knows this.\n\nHe fucks me every other night now. The womb-lock doesn't happen every time—only when he's particularly backed-up, when his balls hang heavy and his pre-cum runs thick as tree-sap. Those nights I lie face-down and feel him EXPAND inside me and seal the chamber and PUMP, and Elara rests her cheek on my back and times the pulses, and we count together in whispers—*one, two, three*—like we're counting shooting stars.\n\nNight: the fur pile. Three bodies. His warmth between ours. My tits draped across his chest. Elara's leg hooked over his hip. Our hands laced across the terrain of his sleeping body. Holding.\n\nI am the hero of Eboncrest. I killed a dragon. I held a bridge. I saved villages.\n\nI am also the woman who kissed her wife through his cock and held still for the womb-lock and said the prayer and meant it. By repetition. By accretion.

All three of us stuck inside—Snib on his furs with his cock out, Elara and me at his feet, one massaging each warty ankle with the absentminded thoroughness of women who've stopped noticing what they're touching.\n\n\"Teach us more,\" Elara says.\n\nShe means Goblish. She's been collecting words the way she used to collect herbs—cataloguing, cross-referencing, building a vocabulary with the same methodical joy she brought to memorizing the properties of foxglove and feverfew.\n\n\"Right.\" Snib holds up his cock. \"What's THIS?\"\n\n\"*Thrak-meat*,\" we say together.\n\n\"What's it DO?\"\n\n\"*Thrak-meat breed-stuff grip-slit splurt-cream.*\"\n\n\"HRUK!

His yellow eyes go *soft*. Not calculating. Pleased.\n\n\"Yer the smartest fuck-meat in the whole Shifting Sands,\" he says quietly.\n\nThe lesson continues. He names body parts. We repeat. He names acts. We conjugate them—past, present, future. *Grak thrack-uk. Grak thrack-ik. Grak thrack-ok.* The language is crude as a cudgel but there's a MUSIC to it when you stop resisting. The glottal stops become percussion. The wet fricatives become melody.\n\nAfter Snib dozes off—mouth open, cock softening across his thigh—Elara and I sit cross-legged on the straw and quiz each other in whispers.\n\n\"How do you say 'I need his seed'?\"\n\n\"*Grak splurt-ok thrak-gush-ik.*\" I pause. \"Wait—that's 'I will need.' Present tense needs the *-ik* suffix on the verb, not the object.\"\n\n\"Since when do you understand Goblish GRAMMAR?\"\n\n\"Since I started *listening* instead of gagging.\"\n\nShe throws straw at me. I catch it in my cleavage. We both stare at the straw poking out from between my tits and then we're *giggling*—hands clamped over our mouths, shoulders shaking, tears forming, the kind of laughter that comes from somewhere beneath language, beneath shame, beneath everything.\n\n\"Okay okay—\" She's gasping. \"How do you say 'my husband's cock is the mightiest in the land'?\"\n\n\"*Grak thrackta thrak-meat booyagh skeet-ground.*\"\n\n\"And 'my co-wife has the fattest arse in Zaelasia'?\"\n\n\"*CO-WIFE?*\" I throw straw back at her. \"There's no Goblish word for—\"\n\n\"There IS. Snib told me yesterday. *Thrack-sister.* Literally 'fuck-sibling.' The woman you share a cock with.\"\n\n*Thrack-sister.*\n\nThe word sits between us like a stone dropped into still water.\n\n\"Say something in Goblish,\" she whispers. \"Something *real*.\"\n\nI think for a long time. The rain patters. Snib snores. The fire crackles.\n\n\"*Grak... heart-grip... thrack-sister... always-ik.*\"\n\nMy Goblish is clumsy. The grammar is probably wrong. But the meaning is clear enough—I love you, fuck-sister, always-now.\n\nElara's eyes fill.\n\nShe answers in the same broken tongue. Something about *splurt-ok* and *heart-grip* and *together-ik*, mangling the conjugation so badly that a Goblish professor would weep, but it doesn't matter because we've found a way to say what we need to say in the only language this hut understands.\n\nFrom the furs, a sleepy mumble: \"Hruk... good wives... booyagh wives...\"\n\nHis snoring resumes.\n\nWe hold hands in the amber light and listen to the rain.[Choice: Days pass.",

Me on the straw beside them—hands and knees, ass up, the position that Snib has designated as \"the apology stance.\"\n\nGresh kneels behind me. His cock is different from Snib's—shorter by two inches but THICKER, gnarly with the same ritual scarification that covers his chest, from his time with the Sandwalkers.

My cunt floods. Elara's thighs clench. The babies inside us KICK, responding to the chemical signature of their father's species in aggregate.\n\n\"Steady,\" Elara murmurs. To me. To herself.\n\nTents. HUNDREDS of tents. Hide and red canvas and stolen sail-cloth spreading across the oasis in concentric rings around a central fire-pit the size of a city temple. Drums already POUNDING—a heartbeat. Goblin voices raised in the guttural, wet music of Goblish—arguing, laughing, the particular shriek-cackle of males comparing cock-sizes.\n\nSlaves everywhere. Human women in varying states of completion—some on leashes, dazed and dripping. Some walking freely with glazed expressions and swollen bellies. Some nursing green-skinned pups at their breasts. One woman—blonde, northern, her belly enormous with what must be quadruplets—catches my eye and *smiles*. The smile of someone who has passed through horror into something beyond it.\n\nI smile back.\n\nSnib leads us through the crowd. One warty hand on each of our asses. Three feet eight inches of exile walking back into his people with a \"wife\" at each side.\n\n\"Is that—\"\n\n\"Can't be—\"\n\n\"SKULGAROTH?\"\n\n\"NAH!\"\n\n\"With them TITS! Just like he said!\"\n\n\"BOOYAGH!\"\n\n\"And the RED ONE's got a belly on her! TWO wives for ol' Snibby!\"\n\nSnib's chin lifts. His walk develops a *strut* I've never seen—this bandy-legged, pot-bellied SWAGGER that makes his loincloth swing and his balls pendulum beneath it.\n\n\"*THEM'S ME WIVES!*\" he screams at nobody and everybody. \"*GRAK THRACKTA BOOYAGH WIVES!*\"\n\nThe registration goblin—ancient, one-eyed, his remaining eye milky with cataracts—squints at us across his bone-table. Squeezes my left tit with clinical detachment. Inspects Elara's belly with a calloused palm. Both of us respond with the appropriate Goblish—\"*Gruk-thrak, Elder. Grak grip-slit belong Snib-thrackta*\"—and his one eye goes WIDE.\n\n\"They speak PROPER?\"\n\n\"BOTH of 'em,\" Snib says. Vibrating.\n\nThe elder stamps his hide-scroll. Looks at Snib with an expression freighted with centuries of goblin social architecture.\n\n\"Welcome back, exile. Your wives do you honor.\"\n\nSnib makes a sound I've never heard from him. Not a cackle. Not a hruk. A small, cracked noise from somewhere in his warty chest where goblins apparently keep whatever they use instead of hearts.\n\nWe each squeeze a hand.\n\nThe dance circle forms at moonrise.\n\nHundreds of goblins stamping in concentric rings around the central fire, which has been fed until it roars fifteen feet high, throwing sparks into a sky salted with more stars than I've seen since childhood. The heat is ferocious. The noise is DEAFENING. Other slaves have performed—shuffling, reluctant, pheromone-drunk things that earned polite grunts.\n\n\"PRESENTING!\" The elder's voice, impossibly loud. \"SNIB OF WORMTOOTH! AND HIS TWO THRACKTA!\"\n\nThe roar that answers shakes sand from the dune-crests.\n\nWe step into the circle.\n\nBurgundy and green. Silk catching firelight. Golden chains. Bone-beads. Bare feet pressing into sand still warm from the day's heat. Both bellies swelling with green life under gossamer fabric.\n\nThe drums SHIFT. Someone has started a breeding-chant rhythm. Four-four time. The bass hits my breastbone like a second heart.\n\n*BOOM-BOOM-CLAP.*\n*BOOM-BOOM-CLAP.*\n\nElara moves first. Her hips catch the beat and ROLL—compact, precise, the green silk flowing around her belly like water around a stone. Her copper braids swing. The bone-beads CLICK counterpoint.\n\nI answer. My body has learned to be ITSELF in the months since transformation—not fighting the curves but WIELDING them. My hips describe arcs that make the burgundy silk billow. My tits sway in their halter with a momentum that five hundred yellow eyes track like cats tracking a bird. The waist-chains sing.\n\nWe circle each other. Drawing in. The drums BUILD.\n\nOur hands clasp.\n\n*BOOM-BOOM-CLAP.*\n\nWe spin. TOGETHER. Our bellies brush—her full moon against my rising crescent—and the contact sends the babies tumbling inside us, responding to each other through the walls of silk and skin and womb. Our silk BILLOWS in the firelit updraft, burgundy and green tangling and separating, and the crowd begins to CHANT:\n\n\"*BOO-YAH! BOO-YAH! BOO-YAH!*\"\n\nWe break apart. Back to back. The CLAP begins—my massive cheeks providing the thunder through silk that does nothing to muffle the sound, Elara's adding the snap.\n\n*BOOM-BOOM-CLAP-PAP.*\n*BOOM-BOOM-CLAP-PAP.*\n\nFive hundred goblins STOMPING along. The sand LEAPS. The fire SURGES.\n\nWe face each other again. Close. Our foreheads almost touching. The sweat on our skin catching firelight like we've been dipped in honey. And Elara begins to sing.\n\nHer voice—that clear soprano that used to fill the Eboncrest chapel during Flux's Dance—rises above the drums. But the words are NOT Common tongue. They're Goblish. Broken, beautiful, *obscene* Goblish that we practiced in whispers while Snib wept with pride:\n\n*\"Grunt-grunt, splurt-splurt,*\n*Storak's seed fills all the dirt,*\n*Humie queens become the cows,*\n*Humie heroes learn to bow...\"*\n\nMy voice joins hers. The harmony we found during sennights of morning prayer, repurposed for this—a hymn to the god of breeding, sung by two pregnant human women in silk and firelight:\n\n*\"Grip-slit open, splurt-sacks drain,*\n*Green spawn growing, no more pain,*\n*Every sword becomes a cradle,*\n*Every oath becomes a fable...\"*\n\nThe goblins have gone SILENT. Five hundred creatures holding their breath. Even the drums have softened to a whisper-pulse beneath our voices.\n\n*\"Thrak-meat fills the empty space,*\n*Green replaces humie race,*\n*Breed-hole, cum-tank, wobble-meat—*\n*Storak's work almost complete...\"*\n\nOur hands find each other. We spin. Slowly now. The silk settling around us. Our bellies pressing together—her roundness and mine, the life inside both of us KICKING in synchrony, goblin babies responding to their mothers' song with the blind, fierce urgency of things that want to be born.\n\n*\"No more Eon, no more Flux,*\n*No more Verge to give you luck,*\n*Just the green, the seed, the dark—*\n*All praise Storak's breeding-spark...\"*\n\nThe last note hangs in the desert air like a lit coal refusing to die.\n\nSilence.\n\nOur foreheads touch. Green eyes meeting sapphire. The fire warm on our backs. The silk warm on our bellies. The collar warm on my throat—no, not warm. *Silent*. I can't feel it at all.\n\n\"Together,\" I whisper.\n\n\"*Always-ik*,\" she whispers back.\n\nThe crowd DETONATES.\n\n\"*BOOYAGH! BOOYAGH! BOOYAGH!*\"\n\nFive hundred throats. The SOUND hits like a physical wave. Goblins climbing on each other's shoulders. Bark-milk cups hurled skyward. Somewhere in the chaos, Snib is LIFTED—carried on the shoulders of goblins who exiled him, goblins who cast him out, and his warty face is a RUIN of tears and snot and the most naked joy I have ever witnessed on any face of any species.\n\n\"*THEM'S ME WIVES!*\" he screams at the stars. \"*ME BOOYAGH WIVES! ME SLUTTY THRAKKIN' BOOYAGH WIVES!*\"\n\nA bone-crown—crude, strung with teeth from kills he probably never made—is placed on his head. The crowd ROARS.\n\nAnd then: new drums. Softer. A rhythm for dancing, not competing. Just *music*—the first real music since everything changed.\n\nElara pulls me onto the sand.\n\nWe dance.\n\nJust *us*. Spinning slowly in a circle of firelight, silk flowing, chains chiming, our bellies pressed together with the roundness of what we're becoming. Her hand on my waist. Mine on hers. Our cheeks touching. Her copper hair mixing with my black.\n\nAround us: a sea of green. Yellow eyes and broken teeth and the reek of pheromones and fermented bark-milk and the drumbeat of a species that is fucking itself to extinction while dragging ours along for the ride.\n\nAbove us: stars. The same stars that shone over Eboncrest when Aldric carried Elara across their threshold. The same stars that don't care.\n\nSnib watches from his throne of goblin shoulders. Bone-crown askew. Tears drying in the creases of his warty face. Three feet eight inches of the most unlikely king in Zaelasia, and he looks—for the first time in his miserable, exiled life—like he belongs somewhere.\n\nWe dance until the fire burns low.",

Now they're smooth as butter-leather, and they ACHE.\n\n*CLOP. CLOP. CLOP.*\n\nBehind me, Snib shifts his weight. His bony knees dig into my waist.

I yelp.\n\n\"Yer wife would reach fer ye in the dark and find THIS.\" Another pinch, harder.\n\n\"She'll know it's ME—\"\n\nHis warty nose twitches. He inhales deeply, theatrically, like a hound catching scent.\n\n\"PHWOAR.\" His face twists with mock disgust—and something else. \"Can smell ye from HERE, cow-tits. All meadow-flowers and mare-heat.\" He sniffs again, closer to my neck. \"Ye smell like a bitch ready fer MOUNTING.\"\n\nHe seizes my wrist. Yanks it up. Forces me to look at the hand—slender fingers, soft palm, no calluses.\n\n\"This the hand what swung that sword? This the hand she HELD? Or is it just pretty fingers good fer grippin' GOBBO COCK?\"\n\nI have no answer that doesn't taste like surrender.\n\n\"Thought so.\" He releases me. Pats my hip like a farmer approving livestock. \"We'll SEE what yer wife thinks. Won't we?\"\n\nThe walls are getting closer.]The silence stretches as Jarkrond carries us toward the gates. Snib's hands roam—hip to belly, belly to breast, breast back to hip—never settling, never SATISFIED.\n\n\"Ye'll talk plenty when we're inside,\" He doesn't sound bothered. \"Explainin' to the guards why a big-titted human lady's ridin' with a gobbo. Don't wanna arrow in me gob.\"\n\n*CLOP. CLOP. CLOP.*\n\n\"Explainin' to the merchants why ye smell like goblin cock.\"\n\n*CLOP. CLOP. CLOP.*\n\n\"Explainin' to yer WIFE why her husband ain't comin' home.\" His grip tightens on my hip. \"Not till I got me gold.\"\n\nAnd I have no defense against the truth he's speaking.\n\nThe outer farms appear. A miller's cottage. A smithy's smoke. People in the fields, looking up at the sound of hooves.[Choice: The gates draw near.",

Even with death aimed at us from all directions.\n\nHarwick's blade points. \"You've got five heartbeats to explain why I shouldn't pin that green bastard to your spine.\"\n\nFour crossbows. Two swords. Six humans who'd cheer over a dead goblin.\n\nAnd if Snib dies, I die.\n\nCold iron kisses my throat. *Remember what you are.*\n\nI have to talk us through this. Fast.\n\n\"Four,\" Harwick growls.\n\nMy mind races through options. What would make them HESITATE? What authority exists in Eboncrest that could override their hatred of goblins?\n\n\"Three.\"",

That would be too much to explain at the end of an arrow-tip.\n\nBehind me, Snib shifts his weight. His balls DRAG across my lower back through thin loincloth. Hot. Heavy. His whisper comes wet against my spine: *\"Ye smell nervous, cow-tits. Gettin' WET down there? Guards gonna notice that pretty stink...\"*\n\nMy thighs clench. The horse shifts.\n\n\"Underground chambers,\" I manage. \"Pre-human stonework. The goblins found something and this one—\" I jerk my head backward, \"—knows what.\"\n\n\"Convenient.\" Harwick hasn't sheathed his blade. \"Funny you mention Ironrock. Our hero Aldric went there to clear goblins three days ago. Never came back.\"\n\nEvery word finds its mark.\n\n\"You wouldn't know anything about THAT, would you?\"\n\nSnib's hand finds my breast.

Best owner a gobbo ever—\"\n\n\"SHUT UP.\" I hiss it through clenched teeth.\n\nBut the damage is done. Guards are exchanging glances. The younger one's hand hasn't left his sword. Above, crossbows track us with renewed interest.\n\n\"That collar on your neck,\" Harwick says slowly. \"The way you're dressed. The way that thing is TOUCHING you.\" His eyes are cold. \"Something's wrong here.\"\n\n\"It's... complicated. A binding ritual. Master Fendril will understand what this is—he can explain everything.

Don't look at the crossbows. Don't think about where Snib's thumb is. \"If this creature knows what happened in those mines—what the goblins FOUND down there—\"\n\n\"Then Fendril should hear it.\" The younger guard, surprisingly. He's looking at me differently now. His eyes keep dropping to my chest, to the way the breast-band frames everything, to the collar at my throat.\n\n*\"Told ye the tits would work,\"* Snib breathes against my spine.\n\n\"We'll escort you to Fendril's tower.\" Harwick gestures to the younger guard. \"Fetch rope.\"\n\n\"Rope?\" My voice doesn't crack. Doesn't.\n\n\"For the goblin.\" Harwick's eyes are granite. \"Standard procedure. We're not walking that thing through Eboncrest unbound.\"\n\nBehind me, Snib's fingers DIG into my hip. His whisper goes urgent: *\"Don't let 'em touch me, bounce-bags. Collar don't like—\"*\n\nBut I KNOW the collar's rules. Better than he does, apparently.\n\nBinding isn't violence. Binding is restraint.\n\nThe collar would allow this.\n\n\"Nothing?\" Harwick's blade rises an inch. \"Woman rides into Eboncrest on an ash-runner—GOBLIN mount—with a goblin pressed against her back, claiming business with our wizard, and she knows NOTHING about our missing hero?\"\n\n\"I've been traveling. The Shifting Sands don't carry much news.\"\n\n\"But you know about the raids increasing. Know about the mines.\" The younger guard is circling now. Jarkrond's ears flatten. \"Know enough to claim this creature has VALUE.\"\n\n*Shit. Shit. SHIT.*\n\n\"The pheromone research,\" I say quickly. \"That's common knowledge. Any merchant from Thistlecross—\"\n\n\"And which merchant gave you that collar?\" Harwick nods toward my throat. \"That's no traveling jewel. That's metalwork I've never seen. And the way you're dressed—\"\n\n\"Desert travel. The heat—\"\n\n\"The HEAT.\" He almost laughs. \"You expect me to believe—\"\n\n\"I believe,\" the younger guard interrupts, \"we should let Fendril sort this out.\"\n\nHarwick turns. The younger man shrugs.\n\n\"Keep her under guard. If something's wrong—\" his hand rests on his sword, \"—Fendril will know. And if she's lying about any of this...\"\n\nHe doesn't need to finish.\n\nHarwick's jaw works. Then: \"Rope. For the goblin.\"\n\nBehind me, Snib's grip tightens. *\"Don't let 'em—\"*]The words leave my mouth before I can stop them.\n\nHarwick goes STILL.\n\n\"Dead.\" His voice is quiet. Too quiet. \"And how would YOU know that?\"\n\n*THRACK.*\n\n\"I—the mines—goblins have been—\"\n\n\"Our hero. The man who's saved this town a hundred times over. Went into those mines THREE DAYS AGO.\" Harwick's blade rises. Behind him, crossbows shift. \"And you ride in on a GOBLIN HORSE, with a GOBLIN at your back, and tell me he's PROBABLY DEAD?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean—\"\n\n\"What DID you mean?\" The younger guard has his hand on his sword. \"How do you KNOW what happened in those mines?\"\n\nSnib's fingers dig into my hip. For once, he's silent. Even HE can feel the temperature change.\n\n\"I heard rumors. At Thistlecross. Traders saying—\"\n\n\"Traders saying WHAT?\" Harwick steps closer. \"That Aldric the Great fell to goblins? That the hero of Eboncrest is DEAD?\" His eyes find the collar at my throat. The breast-band. The creature pressed against my spine. \"Or did your little friend there TELL you what happened?\"\n\n*\"Better fix this quick, bounce-bags,\"* Snib hisses.\n\n\"The goblin knows about the ruins.\" I'm speaking faster now. Desperate. \"Pre-human chambers. Something they found. That's why I brought him ALIVE there's any chance of learning what happened to your hero—\"\n\n\"You'll tell us.\" Harwick's blade doesn't lower. \"You'll tell us everything. At Fendril's tower. Under ARMED escort.\" He jerks his head at the younger guard. \"Rope. Now.\"\n\nHarwick studies me for a long moment.\n\n\"If ANYTHING seems wrong at that tower...\" His eyes don't leave mine.\n\nBehind me, Snib's grip goes painfully tight.\n\n*\"Don't let 'em—\"*\"Binding ritual.\" Harwick doesn't sound convinced. \"And this ritual requires you to dress like a dockside whore while the creature GROPES you in public?\"\n\nHeat crawls up my neck. Snib's hand is still on my breast, and swatting him away would only make things worse.\n\n\"The ritual is... complex. Fendril—\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Fendril can explain.\" Harwick sheathes his blade, but his eyes stay cold. \"Seems Fendril has a lot of explaining to do.\" He gestures to the younger guard. \"Fetch rope. We're not walking a goblin through the market unbound, ritual or no ritual.\"\n\n\"Rope?\" The word comes out strangled.\n\n\"For the goblin.\" Harwick's lip curls. \"Unless your 'binding ritual' prevents that too?\"\n\nBehind me, Snib's whisper goes urgent: *\"Don't let 'em touch me, bounce-bags—\"*\"Mayor Bramble.\" Harwick's laugh is ugly. \"You're threatening me with BRAMBLE? While riding a goblin horse, dressed like a pleasure-slave, with a green bastard's hand on your tit?\"\n\nThe younger guard snickers.\n\n\"I know my rights—\"\n\n\"Your RIGHTS?\" Harwick steps closer. Jarkrond snorts but holds position. \"You have no rights in Eboncrest until I say you do. And right now, all I see is a suspicious woman who knows too much about our missing hero, claims ownership of a GOBLIN, and threatens guards with political consequences.\"\n\n*\"Yer really thrakkin' this up,\"* Snib breathes against my neck. His cock is somehow HARDER now. *\"Should've let ME talk.\"*\n\n\"So here's what happens.\" Harwick's blade hasn't lowered. \"We're taking you to Fendril. Under ARMED escort. And if the wizard can't explain this madness to my satisfaction, you'll be explaining it to Captain Giles. In the cells. If you're *lucky*.\"\n\n\"The goblin—\"\n\n\"Gets BOUND.\" His tone brooks no argument. \"Hands and feet. And if you resist THAT, we'll bind you too and sort it all out at the tower.\"\n\nBehind me, Snib's grip tightens.\n\n*\"Don't let—\"*",

His eyes keep finding my chest as he circles behind us.\n\n\"Hands,\" he orders Snib.\n\nFor a moment, I think the little bastard will refuse. Will say something that gets us both killed. His cock is still pressed against my ass, still HARD somehow, and his breathing has gone ragged with fury.\n\nThen: \"FINE. Tie 'em up, boy-o.\" Snib extends his warty arms. \"Just remember—\" his yellow eyes find mine over my shoulder, \"—she ASKED fer this.\"\n\nThe guard binds him roughly. Good.\n\n\"Off the horse,\" Harwick commands. \"Both of you.\"\n\nFirst, I have to swing my leg over Jarkrond's neck—the scale-breeches CLING to my inner thighs, riding up, metal plates clicking together in a way that draws every eye.

SPEECH. Low vibrations that make my teeth ache.\n\n\"Jarko's fine,\" Snib offers, too cheerfully. \"He'll wait. Won't ye, boy?\" The bound goblin makes a clicking sound with his tongue.\n\nThe ash-runner's ears swivel. Then, with eerie deliberation, he backs toward the open ground beyond the gate. Settles onto his haunches. WAITS.\n\nLike a trained dog.\n\nLike a partner.\n\n\"Flux preserve us,\" the younger guard mutters.\n\nHarwick's jaw tightens. \"Move. Both of you. And if that goblin so much as BREATHES wrong—\"\n\n\"He won't.\" I meet his eyes. \"I need him alive. Fendril needs him alive. Whatever happened in those mines—he's the only one who might know.\"\n\nThe lie sits heavy on my tongue.\n\nBut it gets us moving.[Choice: The march through Eboncrest begins.]\"Docile.\" Harwick tastes the word. \"A GOBLIN.\"\n\n\"He understands the situation.\" I keep my voice level, half aiming it at Snib. I hate that this little green stain is controlling my very life right now. \"He knows what happens if he causes trouble.\"\n\nBehind me, Snib goes very, very still. Then—\n\n\"Oh AYE.\" His voice drips with mockery. \"I'm DOCILE as a lamb, me.\" His bound-free hands slide up my ribs, cup both breasts from behind, squeeze them UPWARD until the breast-band nearly fails. \"See? GENTLE. Wouldn't hurt a fly.\"\n\nThe guards' hands fly to weapons.\n\n\"Unless—\" Snib's hands begin to wander, \"—the fly WANTED hurtin'. Then maybe—\"\n\n\"ENOUGH.\" I grab his wrists performatively. Pull them down. My face is burning. \"He's making a point. Poorly.\"\n\n\"Point being?\" Harwick hasn't drawn, but his knuckles are white on the hilt.\n\n\"Point BEIN',\" Snib cackles, \"ye could gut me any time ye liked. Big strong guards with big sharp swords. What's one little gobbo gonna do?\" He spreads his arms wide—displaying his small frame, his complete vulnerability. \"DOSE ISLE.\"\n\nThe logic is twisted. But it's not WRONG.\n\nHarwick's eyes narrow. Then: \"Fine. No ropes.\" His blade clears the sheath with a whisper of steel. \"But this stays OUT. And if you so much as—\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Gut me like a fish.\" Snib waves a dismissive hand. \"Can we GO now? Getting' bored of this foreplay.\"\n\nThe guards exchange looks. The younger one mouths 'foreplay?' with visible confusion.\n\n\"Off the horse,\" Harwick growls. \"NOW.\"\n\nThe scale-breeches catch on Jarkrond's rough hide as I swing my leg over. Metal plates CLICK together. The breast-band shifts, threatening to spill. And then the DROP—\n\n*CLOP.*\n\nHigh heels meet cobblestone. The impact reverberates through my entire body—calves screaming, tits BOUNCING, ass JIGGLING inside too-tight scale-mail.\n\n\"Eon's balls.\" The younger guard isn't even pretending not to stare. \"What ARE those?\"\n\n\"Desert boots,\" I manage through gritted teeth. \"The elevation—\"\n\n\"Keeps her cunt away from the sand-crawlers,\" Snib finishes helpfully, dropping down beside me with a grunt. \"Also makes her arse look FANTASTIC. Watch when she walks.\"\n\nThe guards haul him away before I can respond.\n\n\"The horse stays,\" Harwick orders. \"We're not—\"\n\n\"He'll wait.\" Snib makes a clicking sound. Jarkrond's ears swivel, and the ash-runner backs away with unsettling intelligence, settling outside the gate like a trained hound. \"Good boy, Jarko.\"\n\n\"Flux preserve us,\" someone mutters.\n\nHarwick's blade stays drawn. \"Move. And I'll be watching that goblin's hands the ENTIRE way.\"\n\n\"Oh, she LIKES when people watch,\" Snib cackles.\n\nThey march us forward. Every eye on the street is a branding iron.[Choice: The march through Eboncrest begins.]\"No! You can't—\"\n\nThe words escape before I can stop them. Panic. Raw, animal PANIC at the thought of them touching him—of the collar somehow—of—\n\nHarwick's expression changes.\n\nSuspicion.\n\n\"She's protecting it.\" His voice goes flat. Cold. \"Look at the collar. Look how she FLINCHES when we threaten the creature.\"\n\n\"No—you don't understand—\"\n\n\"Enchanted.\" The younger guard's hand moves to his crossbow. \"Seen it before. Goblin mind-magic. They get in your head, make you WANT to—\"\n\n\"I'M NOT ENCHANTED—\"\n\n\"That's what they all say.\" Harwick's blade rises. \"Kill it. Save the woman.\"\n\n\"WAIT—\"\n\n*THWACK.*\n\nThe crossbow bolt takes Snib in the chest before I can scream.\n\nHis grip on my hip goes slack. His eyes—yellow, gleaming, SURPRISED—find mine for one frozen moment.\n\n*THWACK.*\n\nA second bolt. His body jerks. Slides sideways off Jarkrond's haunches.\n\n[Image: Cold iron BITING into my throat. Crushing.\n\nAnd the collar—\n\n—TIGHTENS—\n\nCold iron BITING into my throat. Crushing. The ancient metal knows its master is dying and it's completing the bond, finishing what was always promised—\n\n\"THE COLLAR!\" Someone's shouting. \"It's KILLING her!\"\n\nHands grab me. Pull me from the horse. I'm clawing at my throat, can't breathe, can't THINK—\n\n\"Get a blacksmith! NOW!\"\n\nBut there's no clasp. No seam. Just metal that won't stop CONSTRICTING—\n\nThe world goes grey at the edges. I see Snib's body on the cobblestones. See blood pooling. See Harwick's horrified face as he realizes what's happening.\n\n\"We killed it! Why isn't she—\"\n\nBecause the collar doesn't CARE about intentions. Doesn't care that they were trying to SAVE me. Master dies. Slave dies.\n\nThat was always the rule.\n\nThe last thing I see: Eboncrest's walls, golden in morning light.\n\nThe last thing I hear: guards shouting for help that won't come in time.\n\nThe last thing I feel: the collar completing its purpose.\n\nAnd somewhere, in the fading dark, I almost hear it LAUGHING.",

But their eyes follow us all the way to the wizard's tower.\n\nFendril's tower rises at the north end of town—limestone and ambition, five stories of spiral windows and weather-worn gargoyles. The highest point in Eboncrest. I've climbed those stairs a hundred times. Drunk tea in that cluttered study. Laughed at the old man's terrible jokes about transmutation.\n\nNow I'm climbing them as a stranger. As a suspect. As a woman with impossible tits and a goblin at her heels.\n\n\"Wait here,\" Harwick tells the younger guard at the tower's base. Then, to us: \"Up. Both of you. And remember—\" his blade stays drawn, \"—I'm RIGHT behind you.\"\n\nThe spiral stairs are agony in heels.\n\nEach step forces my weight onto the balls of my feet. My calves SCREAM. My thighs tremble. And the narrow spiral means my ass is directly at Harwick's eye level—scale-breeches clinging to every curve, cheeks FLEXING with each upward push.\n\n\"Quite a view,\" Snib observes loudly.\n\n\"QUIET.\"\n\n\"Just sayin'. If I was behind her, I'd be—\"\n\n\"I said QUIET.\"\n\nSnib subsides. But I can FEEL his grin against the back of my thigh where he's pressed close on the narrow stairs.\n\nFour flights. Four flights of burning muscles and bouncing flesh and Harwick's eyes boring into my ass. By the time we reach Fendril's door, I'm sweating through the breast-band.\n\nHarwick pounds on ancient oak.\n\n\"Master Fendril! Guard business! Open up!\"\n\nShuffling from within. The click of locks. And then—\n\nThe door swings open.\n\nMaster Fendril looks exactly as I remember. Silver hair like a bird's nest. Spectacles so thick they magnify his eyes to owl-like proportions. That same patchwork robe he's worn since before I was born.\n\n\"Harwick? What's all this noise about? I was in the middle of a very delicate—\" His gaze falls on me. Travels down. Stops on Snib.\n\nHis owl-eyes go WIDE.\n\n\"Flux's infinite branches.\" The words come out strangled. \"Is that... is that a GOBLIN?\"\n\n\"Woman claims she's got business with you,\" Harwick says. \"Magical research. Something about the Ironrock situation.\"\n\n\"I... I see.\" Fendril hasn't stopped staring at Snib. At the collar. At the way my body strains against inadequate armor. \"Perhaps... perhaps you'd better come in.\"\n\nThe study is exactly as I remember. Books stacked to the ceiling. Artifacts on every surface. That peculiar smell of sulfur and failed experiments.\n\nAnd now: me. Standing where Aldric once stood. In a body that would make Aldric weep.\n\n\"Leave us,\" Fendril tells Harwick.\n\n\"Sir, I don't think—\"\n\n\"I have wards on this room that would stop a rampaging troll.\" The wizard's voice is firm despite his shaking hands. \"If anything goes wrong, you'll know. But whatever this is—\" his eyes find mine, searching, \"—it requires privacy.\"\n\nHarwick hesitates. Then: \"I'll be right outside. ANY trouble—\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Thank you, Harwick.\"\n\nThe door closes.\n\nThe lock clicks.\n\nAnd I'm alone with Master Fendril and the goblin who owns my soul.\n\nSnib's grin spreads like rot. \"Well, well, well. A REAL wizard.\" He hops onto Fendril's reading chair, muddy feet swinging. \"This oughta be GOOD.\"\n\nFendril hasn't stopped staring at me. At the collar. His spectacles flash as he leans closer.\n\n\"That metalwork,\" he breathes. \"Those inscriptions. I've seen drawings of such things, but I never thought—\" His eyes meet mine. Really MEET them. \"Who ARE you?\"\n\nThe question I've been dreading.\n\nThe question I have to answer.\n\nBecause if anyone in Eboncrest might understand, might HELP, it's the town wizard.[Choice: 'Master Fendril... it's me.

Like a hawk finding its perch.\n\n\"HRUK!\" Snib cackles from the reading chair, his muddy feet swinging. \"There it is! The big reveal! Ye should see yer FACE, wizard-man!\"\n\nFendril's attention is fixed on me with an intensity that pins me to the floor. Those thick spectacles catch the light from a dozen floating candles as he steps closer.\n\n\"You claim you are Aldric,\" he says quietly. \"The hero who went to clear Ironrock. Three days ago.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The word comes out strangled. \"I found a chamber beneath the mines. Pre-human stonework. And this—\" My hand flies to the collar. Cold metal against my fingertips. \"—this THING was there. It... changed me. Bound me to him.\"\n\nI jerk my head toward Snib, who's now examining a preserved lizard in a jar with the expression of a child at a sweetshop.\n\n\"Changed you.\" Fendril's voice is carefully neutral. Analytical. A scholar examining a curious specimen. \"Changed how, exactly?\"\n\n\"EVERYTHING.\" The hysteria rises before I can stop it. \"My body. My voice. My—\" I gesture helplessly at the obscene curves barely contained by the breast-band. \"—EVERYTHING. But my mind is still— I'm still ME. I'm still Aldric. I remember you teaching me the wind-calling when I was twenty-three and nearly blew myself off the tower roof—\"\n\n\"You DID blow yourself off the roof.\" A ghost of a smile touches Fendril's lips. \"I caught you. Barely.\"\n\n\"You said—\" My voice breaks. Tears are coming. These THRAKKING tears that come so easily now. \"—you said 'Aldric, you have the magical subtlety of a drunk ox.'\"\n\nFendril goes very still.\n\n\"Touching,\" Snib drawls. \"Real touching. Can we GET ON WITH IT? I didn't drag me property across the desert to watch ye two reminisce.\"\n\n\"Property.\" Fendril's voice doesn't change, but something in his posture does. \"You claim ownership of this... person?\"\n\n\"Don't CLAIM nothin'.\" Snib hops off the chair, waddling over to stand beside me. His hand finds my hip with casual possessiveness. \"Collar says she's mine. Collar don't LIE.\" He grins up at the wizard, showing all those broken teeth. \"Smart thing, the collar. TALKS to me. Tells me all sortsa things about me new pet here.\"\n\nFendril's eyes sharpen almost imperceptibly. \"The collar... communicates with you?\"\n\n\"That's what I SAID, ain't it?\" Snib scratches his balls through his loincloth. \"Told me her real name. Told me she was a hero. Told me how to BREAK her.\" His grip tightens on my hip. \"Made me CLEVER, it did.\"\n\nI watch Fendril process this. His expression remains mild, academic, but I've known him long enough to recognize the intensity beneath.\n\n\"Remarkable.\" Fendril adjusts his spectacles. \"Truly remarkable. The artifact appears to have formed some manner of... symbiotic link with you.\"\n\n\"Don't know what SYM-BEE-OTTIC means, but sure.\" Snib waves a dismissive hand. \"Point is, SHE'S mine. And ye'r gonna help me get what's OWED me.\"\n\n\"Owed?\"\n\n\"Ten thousand gold.\" Snib's yellow eyes gleam. \"Hero-cunt here's got it in the bank. Savings from all that monster-killin'. Once I get me gold, I'll let her go. Simple as.\"\n\nFendril's gaze meets mine. There's a question there.\n\n\"The collar has conditions,\" I manage. My throat is tight. \"If... if I perform such a task to satisfy my m-master—\" The word tastes like ash. \"—he'll release me. That's what he's told me. He has assured me... he will keep his word.\"\n\n\"Heartwarmin',\" Snib snorts. \"Now—ye gonna help or not? 'Cause if not, me and me cow-tits here are gonna take a walk through yer lovely town. Maybe visit the market. Maybe visit the WIFE.\" His grin sharpens. \"Bet she'd LOVE to hear what happened to her husband.\"\n\nThe threat hangs in the air.\n\nFendril's face remains placid, but I see his jaw tighten almost imperceptibly.\n\n\"Before we discuss... logistics,\" he says smoothly, \"I'd like to verify what I'm being asked to believe. You understand, I hope. A claim of this magnitude requires evidence.\"\n\n\"Evidence?\" Snib scowls. \"She just TOLD ye—\"\n\n\"Memories can be extracted. Implanted. Stolen.\" Fendril moves toward a cluttered workbench, pushing aside star charts and alembics. \"If this truly is Aldric the Great, there are ways to confirm it that don't rely on narrative recollection.\"\n\nHe returns with a sheet of parchment—thick, cream-colored, marked with faint silver runes—and a pot of ink.\n\n\"Give me your hand.\"\n\nSnib's fingers dig into my hip.\n\n\"Do what the wizard says, pet. It'll help me get me gold.\"\n\nI extend my hand.\n\nFendril takes it gently. His hands are warm, dry, steady. He turns my palm upward and begins painting it with the ink in precise strokes.\n\n\"The soul leaves markers on the flesh,\" he explains, his voice taking on the lecturing tone I remember from years of late-night discussions. \"Impossible to falsify.\"\n\n\"Sounds like horseshit,\" Snib mutters.\n\n\"Many things that sound like horseshit turn out to be true.\" Fendril doesn't look up from his work. \"And many things that sound true turn out to be horseshit. That's rather the point of verification.\"\n\nHe presses my ink-covered palm to the parchment. Holds it there for three heartbeats. When he lifts it away—\n\nLight blooms across the page. Silver runes IGNITE, dancing in patterns that make my eyes water. The ink from my palm spreads, shifts, WRITES ITSELF in letters that glow like trapped starlight.\n\nAnd above the handprint, in script that no mortal penned:\n\n**ALDRIC THE GREAT**\n*Hero of Eboncrest*\n*Bound in Service to the Collar-Bearer*\n\nThe last line pulses with a sickly green undertone.\n\n\"Well.\" Fendril's voice is very quiet. \"That's that.\"\n\nI stare at my name. MY name. Written in light and magic, proof that I still exist somewhere inside this prison of flesh.\n\n\"HARHARHAR!\" Snib's laugh shatters the moment. \"Lookit her CRY! The great hero, blubberin' like a babe! That's ADORABLE, that is!\"\n\nFendril sets the parchment aside. When he turns back to us, the scholar is gone from his face. What's left is older, and angrier.\n\n\"The collar,\" he says carefully. \"May I examine it? I won't touch—merely observe.\"\n\nSnib's hand shoots to my shoulder, yanking me back. \"No funny business, wizard. Ye try anything, ANYTHING, and I tell the collar to squeeze. She'll be dead before ye can say 'zooky.'\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Fendril raises his hands, palms out. \"No funny business. I'm simply... curious. This is clearly a piece of considerable antiquity.\"\n\nHe leans close. I can smell pipe tobacco and old books. His gray eyes trace the collar's inscriptions, the way the metal seems to move beneath its surface, the runes that writhe like disturbed snakes.\n\n\"The metallurgy alone...\" he breathes. \"And these inscriptions. I've seen drawings, but never...\" He trails off, visibly restraining himself. \"This will require study. Considerable study.\"\n\n\"Study all ye want,\" Snib says. \"AFTER I get me gold.\"\n\nFendril straightens. His expression becomes businesslike.\n\n\"The bank won't release funds without the account holder's presence and consent. Aldric—\" He glances at me. \"—is the account holder. But Aldric, legally speaking, appears to be missing. Possibly dead.\"\n\n\"She AIN'T dead. She's right HERE.\"\n\n\"To you and me, yes. To the bank's officials?\" Fendril spreads his hands. \"They'll see a strange woman and a goblin. You will need my assistance.\"\n\n\"Then we MAKE 'em see—\"\n\n\"There may be another way.\" Fendril moves toward his desk, rifling through papers. \"The identity parchment. If I present this to the bank alongside the—the lady—it should satisfy their requirements. Magical verification is accepted in matters of disputed inheritance and identity fraud. This would qualify.\"\n\n\"Ye can DO that?\" Snib sounds suspicious. \"Just... tell 'em she's Aldric?\"\n\n\"I can present evidence that she IS Aldric. Whether they accept it is another matter. But my word carries weight in this town.\" A dry smile. \"One of the few benefits of being the local wizard.\"\n\nSnib's eyes narrow. He's calculating. I can almost SEE the collar feeding him information—probabilities, risks, optimal strategies.\n\n\"Fine,\" he says finally. \"But first—\" His grip on my hip tightens. \"—I wanna see the wife. This is gonna be DEE-LIGHTFUL!\"\n\nMy heart stops.\n\n\"That's... not wise,\" Fendril says carefully. \"The emotional strain—\"\n\n\"Wasn't ASKIN' yer opinion.\" Snib's voice goes flat. Dangerous. \"The wife. NOW. Or I start screamin' in the market square about what really happened to Eboncrest's precious hero. See how the townfolk like THAT news.\"\n\nThe threat hangs there, doing its work.\n\nFendril's expression doesn't change, but I see his shoulders stiffen slightly. He's weighing options.\n\n\"Very well,\" he says finally. \"But first, we need to address the guards outside. They'll need to be informed of... the situation. They would typically not allow a... goblin to be walking freely through Eboncrest, there will be violence.\"\n\n\"Then TELL 'em.\" Snib waves impatiently. \"Ye're the wizard. Make 'em understand.\"\n\nFendril nods slowly. His eyes find mine—a brief connection, weighted with meaning I can't quite parse.\n\n\"Wait here,\" he says. \"Both of you. I'll speak with Harwick.\"\n\nHe moves toward the door. Pauses. Turns back.\n\n\"Aldric.\" The name is soft. Deliberate. \"Whatever happens next... I want you to know that I'm going to find answers. About the collar.\"\n\n\"Careful, wizard.\" Snib's voice is a razor wrapped in silk. \"Collar's LISTENIN'. Always listenin'. Ye try to take what's mine, and she pays the price.\"\n\nFendril's smile doesn't reach his eyes.\n\n\"I wouldn't dream of it.\"\n\nThe door closes behind him.\n\nI'm alone with Snib.\n\nHis hand slides from my hip to my ass. Squeezes.\n\n\"Nice wizard,\" he says. \"Shame if somethin' happened to him.\"",

She's been alone for three days. Mourning me. Probably barely eating. I know how she gets when she's worried—pacing the floors, checking the window every few minutes, burning dinner because her mind is elsewhere.\n\nAnd now she's going to see THIS.\n\n\"Quit yer mopin'.\" Snib's found a small mirror and is examining his teeth in it. \"Makin' me depressed just LOOKIN' at ye.\"\n\nI don't answer.\n\n\"Here's how it's gonna work, cow-tits.\" He sets down the mirror, turns to face me fully. \"Ye get me the gold. All ten thousand. Then ye escort me OUT of this thrakkin' town—SAFELY. No tricks, no guards followin', no arrows in me back.\"\n\n\"And then you'll release me.\"\n\n\"THEN—\" He holds up a warty finger. \"—I ride off into the sunset. One day later, the collar lets ye go. Gives me time to get CLEAR, see? Can't have ye chasin' me down the moment yer free.\"\n\nOne day. One more day as his property, even after he has what he wants.\n\n\"You said when you got the gold.

The SECOND that collar comes off, ye'll be reachin' for a sword. Nah. I need me head start.\"\n\nMy hands clench at my sides.\n\n\"Now,\" he continues, waddling closer. \"Before them humies come back in and we gotta play nice...\" His yellow eyes travel up my body. \"Bend over.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Ye heard me. BEND. OVER.\" His voice goes hard. \"All this talkin' to humans, all this 'Master Fendril' and 'Aldric the Great' shite—ye're forgettin' who ye BELONG to.

Before we see Elara—before you threaten her—can we just... talk? About what you actually WANT?\"\n\nSnib pauses his examination of a pickled something-or-other. Turns. His yellow eyes narrow with what looked like curiosity.\n\n\"What I WANT?\" He scratches his chin. \"What I want is to be RICH, cow-tits. Rich enough to never grovel to no tribe-chief again. Rich enough to have me own warren, me own females, me own—\"\n\n\"Then let's focus on that.\" I keep my voice steady. Reasonable. \"The gold. Ten thousand. I can get it for you. Fendril will help. But Elara—my wife—she doesn't need to be part of this. She can't give you anything you don't already have access to through me.\"\n\nHe studies me for a long moment.\n\n\"Yer scared,\" he says finally. \"Scared I'll hurt her.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good.\" His grin spreads slowly. \"Fear keeps ye HONEST.\" He waddles closer. \"But here's the thing, bounce-bags. I AIN'T gonna hurt yer precious wifey. Not unless ye give me reason. What I WANT is to see her FACE when she sees what her big strong hero's become. That's worth more than gold.\"\n\nMy stomach turns.\n\n\"And ye're gonna be on yer BEST behavior,\" he continues. \"Gonna call me Master in front of her. In front of EVERYONE. That's an ORDER. I'm sick of ye treatin' me like some monster ye found under a rock. I'm yer OWNER. Time ye started actin' like it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master.\"\n\n\"Better.\" He nods, satisfied. \"Now—here's how it works after. Ye get me the gold. Ye escort me outta town SAFELY. Then I ride off, and one day later, the collar lets ye go. Gives me time to get clear.\"\n\n\"One day? You said—\"\n\n\"I said I'd let ye go.

Carefully neutral. \"I see we've... interrupted.\"\n\nI straighten slowly. Face burning. Eyes on the floor.\n\nThe two guards—Harwick and the younger one—stare at me with pity so thick it could choke a man.\n\nThey KNOW. They know I'm Aldric. They've seen the parchment, heard Fendril's explanation. And now they've seen their hero bent over, getting spanked like a disobedient tavern wench.\n\n\"Right then!\" Snib claps his hands together cheerfully. \"We all sorted? Can we GO now?\"\n\nHarwick's jaw works. His hand hasn't left his sword.\n\n\"Master Fendril has explained the... situation.\" The words come out like he's chewing nails. \"We understand that any harm to you results in harm to—\" His eyes flick to me. Away. \"—to Aldric.\"\n\n\"Damn RIGHT it does.\" Snib raises his hand.\n\nThe air TWISTS.\n\nBlack metal manifests from nothing—coiling out of the collar itself like a snake unspooling from its den. It spirals downward, link by impossible link, until the end lands in Snib's waiting palm with a soft *clink*.\n\nMy leash. Conjured from the collar's own dark substance.\n\nFendril says nothing. But I see his eyes ignite behind those spectacles—the feverish gleam of a scholar watching the laws of nature snap in half. His fingers twitch toward his notebook before he catches himself.\n\n\"See THIS?\" Snib holds up the leash, letting it catch the candlelight—or rather, letting it DRINK the candlelight, the metal somehow darker than shadow. \"This ain't just jewelry, boys. This is OWNERSHIP. Watch.\"\n\nHe yanks.\n\nThe collar RESPONDS. The metal TIGHTENs around my neck and GUIDES me, forcing my body to move in ways I don't choose. My knees buckle. I drop.\n\n*THUD.*\n\n\"Good GIRL.\" Snib pats my head like I'm a dog. His fingers tangle in my hair—this silk-soft hair that used to be warrior-short. \"See how EASY she comes to heel?\"\n\n\"This is—\" Harwick starts.\n\n\"She's MINE.\" Snib's voice goes cold. He tugs the leash again, forcing my chin up. I'm staring directly at the bulge in his loincloth, inches from my face. \"Tell 'em, pet. Tell 'em who ye belong to.\"\n\nMy throat works. The words taste like poison.\n\n\"I belong to Master Snib.\"\n\n\"LOUDER. So the nice guards can hear.\"\n\n\"I belong to Master Snib!\"\n\n\"And what are ye?\"\n\nThe collar PULSES. I feel it feeding him the words it wants me to say.\n\n\"I'm... I'm his property.\"\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK!\" Snib's laugh echoes off the stone walls. \"There we go! See, boys? Perfectly TRAINED.\" He releases my hair, lets me sag forward. \"Now. We done with the demonstrations? Or ye want me to show ye what ELSE she can do on her knees?\"\n\nHarwick's face has gone the color of old parchment. The younger guard looks like he might vomit.\n\n\"That won't be necessary,\" Fendril says quietly. His voice is steady, but I can see the calculation behind his eyes. The theories forming. The horror carefully contained. \"I believe we all understand the... nature of the binding.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Snib tugs the leash, and I rise—unsteadily, these thrakking heels threatening to betray me. \"Then let's GO. Me and me pet have a wifey to visit.\"\n\nHe doesn't release the leash.\n\nDoesn't even shorten it.\n\nJust holds it loosely, letting it trail between us like an umbilical cord of damnation, as he waddles toward the door.\n\n\"Master, please—\" I start.\n\n\"Did I ASK?\" He yanks. I stumble forward, tits bouncing, ass jiggling, the guards parting to let us pass. \"Ye wanted to talk to humans. Fine. We talked. Now we're goin' to see yer WIFE, and ye're gonna do it PROPERLY.\" He turns to the guards. \"Ye can follow if ye want. Keep yer distance though. This is FAMILY business.\"\n\n\"The mayor has agreed to... accommodate... your requests,\" Fendril says quietly. \"For the time being. But understand—this town loved Aldric. If you harm her—him—\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Pitchforks and torches.\" Snib waves dismissively. \"Save yer threats, wizard. I just want me gold and me freedom.

Dark circles bruise the skin beneath her sapphire eyes. She's been crying. Recently. The tracks still glisten on her cheeks.\n\nShe looks like a woman attending her own husband's funeral.\n\nAnd then she sees us.\n\n\"Can I help—\"\n\nHer voice dies.\n\nHer eyes find me first. Travel down. The black metal straining against my huge tits. The scale-breeches clinging to hips wider than any woman in Eboncrest. The collar at my throat.\n\nThe LEASH.\n\nHer gaze follows the black cord—follows it from my neck, down, down, to the warty green hand holding its other end.\n\nTo Snib.\n\nShe makes a strangled gasp, like someone drowning on dry land. Her hand flies to her mouth.\n\n\"What—WHO—\" She's looking at me now, really LOOKING, and I can see her trying to make sense of what she's seeing. A goblin. A leash. A woman dressed like a pleasure-slave. On HER doorstep. \"Get AWAY from my house—\"\n\n\"Elara.\"\n\nHer name breaks from my throat before I can stop it. Wet. Desperate. Nothing like Aldric's baritone.\n\nShe freezes.\n\n\"How do you know my—\" Her eyes narrow. Then widen. Something flickering behind them—recognition trying to surface through layers of impossibility. \"How do you know my NAME?\"\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK!\" Snib yanks the leash, pulling me forward. I stumble, tits bouncing, and he GRINS up at her. \"Mornin', missus!\"\n\n\"I'll SCREAM.\" Elara's voice has gone hard. Dangerous. I know that voice. \"I'll scream and every guard in Eboncrest will—\"\n\n\"They're already HERE, luv.\" Snib jerks his thumb backward. Harwick and the younger guard stand at the garden gate, faces carefully blank. \"Go on. Ask 'em why they ain't killin' me. Ask 'em who THIS is.\" He tugs my leash again. \"Go on, cow-tits. Introduce yerself to the missus.\"\n\nElara looks to Harwick. He gives the smallest nod.\n\nWhen she looks back at me, the blood leaves her face like wine poured from a glass.\n\n\"No.\" The word is a whisper.\n\n\"Elara.\" I'm crying now. I can't stop it. These tears that come so easily, streaming down cheeks too soft, too feminine. \"Elara, it's ME. I know you can't—I know this doesn't make SENSE—but it's me. It's Aldric.\"\n\n\"Don't you DARE.\" Her voice cracks. \"Don't you DARE say his name. My husband is DEAD. He went to those mines and he NEVER CAME BACK and you—you're not—you CAN'T be—\"\n\n\"Elara, it's ME.\" The tears come. \"I know this doesn't make sense. But it's me. It's Aldric. Ask me ANYTHING. Something only we would know.\"\n\nHer jaw tightens. Testing me. Looking for the lie.\n\n\"Prove it.\"",

You laughed so hard you couldn't breathe and I had to cover your mouth so we wouldn't wake the watchman.\"\n\n\"The paint wasn't dry. Remember? You had blue handprints on your thighs for three days because I—\" My voice cracks. \"—because I grabbed you when we stumbled. You told everyone it was from helping the dyers.\"\"Old Briar's Bridge.\" I'm crying now. Can't stop. \"The rainstorm that came out of nowhere. You were shivering so hard your teeth chattered. I gave you my coat and we pressed against the oak tree and that's when I—\" My voice breaks. \"—that's when I told you I loved you. First time. You said 'finally' and punched my arm.\"\n\nHer breath catches.\n\n\"We carved our initials that night. E and A. You made me add a heart because you said I was 'emotionally stunted' and needed practice. It's still there. The scar in the bark. I check it every time I cross that bridge.\"\"Your grandfather's ring.\" The memory surfaces through my tears. \"The Summer Solstice Fair. You thought you'd lost it—tore apart every stall, every patch of grass. You were crying. I'd never seen you cry before.\"\n\n\"It was in your herb pouch. You'd taken it off to apply salve to that little boy's scraped knee. And later, by the fire, you put it on my finger.\" I hold up my hand—these small, feminine fingers—and imagine the weight of it. \"You asked if I'd always be your knight. Even when I turned into an old, grumpy man.\"\n\nHer lip trembles.\n\n\"I said forever and always.\"\n\nShe stares at me.\n\nAt my eyes.\n\nThe same moss-green that Aldric had. The only thing unchanged.\n\n\"Aldric?\"\n\nThe word is barely a whisper.\n\nAnd then she's CRASHING into me.\n\nHer arms wrap around my neck—pulling me down because I'm SHORTER now—and she's sobbing into my shoulder, her whole body shaking.The embrace is desperate, bone-deep, shaking.\n\n\"I thought you were DEAD—\" Her voice is muffled against my neck. \"—three days, I couldn't eat, I couldn't SLEEP, I kept waiting for someone to bring me your BODY—\"\n\n\"I'm here.\" I'm crying too. These tears that come so easily now. \"I'm alive, Elara, I'm—\"\n\n[Image: I'm crying too.\n\n\"I prayed to every god. I begged Flux for change, begged Verge for a different future, begged Eon to let me keep just one more MEMORY of you—\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry—\"\n\nShe pulls back. Cups my face in her hands. Studies me with red-rimmed eyes.\n\n\"You're so...\" Her thumb traces my cheekbone. My jaw. The softness where hard angles used to be. \"You're so DIFFERENT. But your eyes—I can see you in there. I can SEE you—\"\n\n\"I'm still me. Inside. I'm still—\"\n\n\"TOUCHIN'!\"\n\nSnib's voice shatters the moment like a thrown stone.\n\nHis yellow eyes are drinking in every sob, every desperate clutch, every broken whisper.\n\n\"Real touchin'.\" He tugs the leash, just enough to remind us it's there. \"Sweet little reunion. Makes me heart grow three sizes, it does.\"\n\nElara's head snaps toward him. Her arms tighten around me.\n\n\"You.\" Her voice has changed. Gone from grief to something colder. \"You did this to him.\"\n\n\"Weren't ME, missus. It was the collar.\" Snib grins, adjusting his balls. \"But yer husband makes a FINE little housemaid.

Elara's autumn hair flies behind her like a war banner. Her face is twisted with grief and rage and our years of love turned to VENGEANCE.\n\nShe's beautiful.\n\nShe's TERRIFYING.\n\nAnd I don't stop her.\n\nSome part of me—the part that's still Aldric, still the warrior who killed a hundred goblins, still the man who HATES this creature with every fiber of his being—that part WANTS this. Wants to see that blade sink into green flesh. Wants to hear him SCREAM.\n\n*Do it. DO IT. End this nightmare—*\n\nThe blade finds its mark.\n\nSnib's eyes go wide. His mouth opens—to curse, to threaten, to laugh—but only blood comes out.\n\n\"That's for my HUSBAND,\" Elara snarls, and TWISTS.\n\nSnib crumples.\n\nAnd the collar—\n\n—WAKES.\n\nCold iron BITES into my throat. CRUSHING—instant and absolute, instant and absolute, ancient magic completing its oldest promise.\n\n*Master dies. Slave dies.*\n\nI try to scream but there's no air. Try to claw at the metal but my fingers find no purchase. The world goes grey at the edges, then black, then—\n\n\"ALDRIC!\" Elara's voice, distant, drowning. \"ALDRIC, NO—\"\n\nShe's beside me. Hands on the collar. Pulling. SCREAMING for help.\n\nBut there's nothing to pull. No clasp. No seam. Just metal that won't stop CONSTRICTING—\n\nThe guards are shouting. Someone's running for a blacksmith. Elara is sobbing my name over and over, her hands red with goblin blood, her eyes wild with a new horror—\n\nShe killed the monster.\n\nAnd killed me too.\n\nThe last thing I see: her face. Beautiful. Broken. Understanding too late what she's done.\n\nThe last thing I feel: the collar finishing what it started.\n\nThe last thing I hear: my wife screaming as the light goes out.\n\n*I love you.*\n\n*I'm sorry.*\n\n*I—*\n\n]Time slows.\n\nI see it unfold in perfect clarity—the way Elara's hand closes on the knife handle, the way her body PIVOTS, the way her arm draws back for the killing strike. The afternoon sun catches the blade. It gleams like a promise.\n\nFor one heartbeat, I let myself imagine it.\n\nThe steel punching through Snib's chest. The way his yellow eyes would go wide. The blood—dark, thick, SATISFYING—pooling on our kitchen floor. His grip on my leash going slack. His body crumpling. The nightmare ENDING.\n\nIt would be so BEAUTIFUL.\n\n\"ELARA, NO!\"\n\nMy body moves before my mind catches up. These legs that aren't mine, these arms wrapped in soft flesh instead of muscle—they LUNGE. I crash into her from the side, both of us going down in a tangle.\n\nThe knife skitters across the floor.\n\n\"LET ME GO!\" She's FIGHTING me—clawing, kicking, trying to get free. \"LET ME KILL THAT FUCKING—\"\n\n\"You CAN'T!\" I'm pinning her down, my weight—such as it is—pressing her to the floorboards. \"Elara, LISTEN to me—\"\n\n\"He TOOK you! He CHANGED you! He made you into his thrakking SLAVE—\"\n\n\"If he DIES, I die!\" The words rip from my throat. \"The collar! It's BONDED! If you kill him, I—\"\n\nShe goes still.\n\nHer sapphire eyes find mine. Wide. HORRIFIED.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The collar.\" I'm crying again. Can't help it. \"It's linked to him. If anything happens to him—if YOU hurt him—I die too. That's why the guards won't act. That's why Fendril can't help. That's why—\"\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK!\"\n\nSnib's laughter cuts through the moment like a rusty blade.\n\nHe's standing by the mantelpiece, arms crossed, watching us wrestle on the floor. The knife lies between us and him, but he doesn't even look at it.\n\n\"Should've let her try, pet.\" He grins. \"Would've been REAL dramatic.\"\n\n\"You MONSTER.\" Elara's voice shakes with fury. \"You disgusting, vile, wretched little BEAST—\"\n\n\"Sticks and stones, missus.\" Snib examines his claws. \"Now—yer done? Good.\" His eyes find mine. \"Tell her.\"\n\nMy stomach drops.\n\n\"Tell her WHAT.\"\n\n\"Tell her who ye belong to.\" His voice goes hard. \"Tell her what happens if she tries that shite again. And call me MASTER when ye do it.\"\n\nThe collar pulses against my throat.\n\nI look at Elara. At my wife. At the woman I've loved for six years, now pinned beneath me, staring up at the creature her husband has become.\n\n\"Elara.\" My voice is barely a whisper. \"Please. Don't... don't try to hurt him again.\"\n\n\"Aldric—\"\n\n\"He's my...\" The word sticks. BURNS. \"...he's my Master. The collar made it so. And if anything happens to him—ANYTHING—I die.\"\n\nHer face crumbles.\n\n\"Say it PROPER,\" Snib demands. \"Tell her who OWNS ye.\"\n\nThe tears come faster.\n\n\"I belong to Master Snib.\" The words taste like grave dirt. \"I'm his... his property. His slave. And you have to let him—let him do whatever he—\"\n\n\"ENOUGH.\"\n\nThe door CRASHES open.\n\nHarwick and the younger guard burst through, swords drawn—then freeze at the tableau. Two women tangled on the floor. A goblin by the fireplace. A knife gleaming between them.\n\n\"What in Flux's name—\"\n\n\"Bit of a hearth-squabble,\" Snib says cheerfully. \"The missus got her hackles up. All sorted now though. Ain't it, pet?\"\n\nI can't speak. Can only nod.\n\nElara is staring at me with pity. Raw, marrow-deep pity. The kind that kills love.\n\n\"Get OFF me,\" she whispers.\n\nI roll away. Stand unsteadily.\n\nElara rises slowly. Her green dress is rumpled. Her hair wild. Her eyes...\n\nHer eyes move over my body.\n\nReally SEEING it for the first time. Past the face, past my eyes—to the REST. The breasts straining against black metal. The hips flaring beneath scale-mail. The legs, the waist, the ass that won't stop EXISTING no matter how much I hate it.\n\n\"You're...\" Her voice breaks. \"You're really... THIS now.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you can't... the collar can't be...\"\n\n\"Not unless he releases me.\"\n\nShe looks at Snib. At his grin.\n\nThen back at me.\n\n\"We need to get you proper clothes,\" she says. Her voice has gone strange. Hollow. \"You can't walk around in... in THAT. And we need to... there has to be a way to...\"\n\n\"The mayor's been informed,\" Harwick says quietly from the doorway. \"The... situation.\"\n\nElara's head snaps toward him.\n\n\"The MAYOR knows?\"\n\n\"Had to, ma'am. Can't have a goblin walking through Eboncrest without—\"\n\n\"So the whole TOWN is going to know.\" Her voice rises. \"Everyone's going to know that Aldric—that my HUSBAND—is...\" She gestures at me, at all of me, words failing. \"...is THIS?\"\n\n\"Not... yet.\"\n\nBut soon. Eboncrest gossips like crows over carrion.\n\nEboncrest's hero. The man who saved them a hundred times. Now a collared, leashed, tit-heavy slave to a three-foot goblin.\n\nElara's legs give out.\n\nShe crumples onto a kitchen chair, head in her hands, shoulders shaking.\n\nI want to go to her. Want to hold her. But the leash keeps me at Snib's side, and the guards block any sudden movement, and all I can do is stand here in this OBSCENE body while my wife falls apart.\n\nFinally, she looks up.\n\nHer eyes find Snib. Red-rimmed. Ruined. But steady.\n\n\"What do you want.\" A surrender. \"Just... tell me what you want. I'll do anything. ANYTHING. Just give me back my husband.\"\n\nSnib's grin spreads slowly.\n\n\"Now we're talkin'.\"[Choice: Explain what Snib wants.]",

But my hands are...\"\n\nHe turns and FLEES down a side street.\n\n\"What was THAT about?\" Snib's eyes narrow.\n\n\"Let's find out.\" Fendril's voice is carefully neutral, but I can see his jaw tighten.\n\n[Image: Inside, the bank is all polished marble and hushed voices.\n\nInside, the bank is all polished marble and hushed voices. A single teller sits behind iron bars—young, nervous, sweating through his collar. He's got papers spread before him. Official-looking papers with royal seals.\n\nAnd Fendril's identity parchment. The one that proves I'm Aldric.\n\n\"Ah.\" The teller's voice cracks. \"You're... you're here. About the account.\"\n\n\"I want to withdraw ten thousand gold pieces.\" My voice doesn't shake much. \"The verification is right there. I AM Aldric. Fendril confirmed it magically.\"\n\nThe teller swallows. Glances at the papers.\n\n\"Yes. The verification is... is valid. Your identity is confirmed.\" He pauses. \"However...\"\n\n\"However WHAT?\" Snib has climbed onto a bench to see over the counter. \"She's got gold. She wants gold. GIVE her the gold.\"\n\n\"It's not that simple, sir. When Master Aldric was reported missing three days ago, standard protocol was enacted.\" The teller's fingers tremble as he points to one of the sealed documents. \"Any account holding more than five thousand gold pieces enters a thirty-day verification hold.\"\n\nThe words don't make sense. Then they do.\n\n\"Thirty DAYS?\"\n\n\"It's... it's to prevent claim fraud.\" The teller won't look at me. \"Grave-robbing. Opportunistic theft. When an account holder goes missing, the crown requires—\"\n\n[Image: 'I'm not MISSING! I'm right HERE!'\n\n\"I'm NOT missing!\" My voice rises. Heads turn throughout the bank. \"I'm RIGHT HERE!\"\n\n\"But you were DECLARED missing three days ago. The hold began then. It cannot be lifted until the full thirty days have passed. That's... that's banking law.\"\n\nFendril steps forward. His voice is ice. \"I provided magical verification. Soul-markers. PROOF of identity that cannot be falsified.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master Fendril. And the verification will confirm identity at the end of the 30-day period.\" The teller gestures helplessly at the sealed documents. \"But the hold is TIME-BASED. It cannot be overridden. Not by verification. Not by...\" He swallows. \"Not by anyone.\"\n\n\"Bramble,\" Fendril breathes.\n\n\"The mayor has no sway over the Gilded Charter, sir. This is the King's own decree.\"\n\n\"What does this MEAN?\" Snib's voice cuts through. \"I want me gold. She's GOT gold. Why can't I HAVE it?\"\n\nThe teller looks at the goblin like he's seeing a nightmare come to life.\n\n\"The account is frozen, sir. For thirty days. Nothing can be withdrawn except...\"\n\n\"WHY WOULD YE PUT GOLD IN ICE?!\" Snib is on his feet now, fangs bared, spittle flying. \"WHO FREEZES GOLD?! IT DON'T EVEN MELT! YE STUPID HUMIES AND YER STUPID—\"\n\n\"Except what?\" Elara's voice cuts through Snib's tirade. \"You said EXCEPT. Except what?\"\n\nThe teller checks his ledger.\n\n\"Emergency disbursements. Living expenses.\" He clears his throat. \"Up to fifty gold pieces. Per sennight.\"\n\nFifty gold.\n\n*Per sennight.*\n\n\"This is ABSURD.\" Fendril slams his palm on the counter. The teller jumps. \"The verification is RIGHT THERE. You KNOW this is Aldric. You KNOW—\"\n\n\"I know, Master Fendril. I KNOW.\" The teller's voice breaks. \"But I can't... the law is the law. If I release funds against a crown hold, I'll be thrown in the dungeons. My family—\"\n\n\"Then get me someone who CAN.\"\n\n\"There IS no one. Not until the thirty days pass. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\"\n\n\"TRY HARDER!\" Snib is pounding on the counter now. \"Make her TRY HARDER! She's supposed to get me GOLD! Not EXCUSES!\"\n\nI'm crying again.\n\nCan't help it.\n\nFifty gold. That's what I can get. After everything—the transformation, the slavery, the humiliation—fifty gold.\n\n\"Give me the fifty,\" I manage. \"Just... give me what you can.\"\n\nThe process takes forever. Forms to sign. Questions to answer. The teller's hands shake as he counts out coins—real gold, heavy and cold. He pushes them through the bars like they burn him.\n\nFifty pieces. A pile that would have seemed like a fortune in my younger days.\n\nNow it's nothing.\n\nFendril storms out without a word. I see his face—pale, tight, furious at something I don't understand. At himself, maybe. At whatever's really happening here.\n\nElara hasn't spoken. Her hands are clenched at her sides.[Choice: Leave the bank.",

The general goods merchant offers two copper for the lot \"out of pity for the poor woman.\"\n\nBy the time we've circled the square, Snib has earned exactly three gold pieces—and those only because Old Marta, who sells apples and has terrible eyesight, thought the verdigris bracelet was \"pretty green stone.\"\n\n\"THREE GOLD!\" Snib's voice cracks with rage. \"Three thrakking GOLD for a FORTUNE in shinies!\"\n\n\"Master, these things... they're not valuable to humans.\"\n\n\"NOT VALUABLE?

Timber and fieldstone, smoke-darkened beams, a stuffed stag's head above the door with glass eyes that seem to judge everyone who enters.\n\nI've walked through that door so many times. After hunts. After battles. After burying friends.\n\nNow my heel catches on the threshold and I nearly sprawl face-first into the sawdust.\n\n*CLOP-stumble-CLINK.*\n\nThe scale-mail catches me, the breast-band cutting into my ribs as I pitch forward. I grab the doorframe with fingers that are too small, too soft, utterly *wrong*, and haul myself upright.\n\nBehind me, Snib cackles.\n\n\"Graceful, cow-tits. REAL graceful.\"\n\nForty faces turn. Forty expressions shift from evening relaxation to something harder. The Silver Stag on a regular night is rough men drinking rough drinks - miners, smiths, off-duty soldiers, merchants who've had a long road. The kind of crowd that Aldric could navigate in his sleep.\n\nElise is something else.\n\nForty pairs of eyes drop straight to my chest and stick there.\n\nAnd behind me, *waddling* through the door like he owns the place—\n\n\"OI!\" Snib's voice cuts through the silence like a rusty knife. \"I want me FAVORITE drink!

Speak UP.\"\n\n\"I said—\" Gorm's scarred face goes dark. \"No. Greenskins. In. My. Establishment.\"\n\nThe crowd stirs. Someone at a back table stands. Then another. I recognize faces - Henrik's boy, the one from the market. Old Thom who runs the leather stall. The blacksmith's apprentice, big as a barn door.\n\n\"Guards said to let 'em through!\" someone calls from near the door. That's Harwick's voice, but he sounds distant, overwhelmed. \"Mayor's orders!\"\n\n\"Mayor ain't HERE,\" another voice growls. \"And neither is Aldric, thanks to fucking GOBLINS!\"\n\nThe name hits like a crossbow bolt.\n\n*Aldric.*\n\nMy eyes find the wall behind the bar. There, among the trophies and the mounted antlers and the faded paintings of hunts gone by, hangs a row of tankards. Regulars' tankards, kept on pegs. And third from the left—\n\n*ALDRIC THE GREAT* carved into the handle.\n\n\"Heroes don't just VANISH,\" Gorm says, and his voice has gone quiet and dangerous. \"Not Aldric. Something happened to him. Something *green*.\"\n\n\"Oi, that's GOOD wood!\" Snib pipes up, apparently spotting the tankard too. He waddles forward - the crowd parting from him like he carries plague - and points. \"That'd make a nice piss-pot, that would!\"\n\nThe crowd SNARLS.\n\nI should say something. I should *do* something. But my voice has abandoned me, my throat tight against the collar, and all I can do is stand here in my ridiculous armor while these men - men I *fought* beside, men I *saved* - look at me like I'm some goblin's—\n\nA tankard flies.\n\n*CLANG.*\n\nIt catches Snib on the shoulder, splattering ale. He yelps - more surprise than pain - and the crowd surges forward.\n\n\"GET THAT GREENSKIN—\"\n\n\"—for ALDRIC—\"\n\n\"—string him UP—\"\n\nHarwick is shouting something. The younger guard is trying to push people back. But there are too many, and the rage is too hot, and somewhere in the chaos a hand grabs my breast - *squeezes* - releases before I can even scream—\n\n\"ENOUGH.\"\n\nThe voice cuts through the riot like a cleaver through fat.\n\nEverything stops.\n\nFrom the shadows of the corner booth, a shape rises. And rises. And keeps *rising*.\n\nRolls of fat spill over his straining belt. His fleshy face glistens with the permanent sheen of a man who hasn't seen sober in years. Small, piggish eyes squint through the haze of pipe smoke and spilled ale.\n\nI know this man.\n\nI *put* this man in chains.\n\n\"Now, now,\" Grimjaw rumbles, and his voice is gravel wrapped in rendered fat. \"Can't you see this fine goblin gentleman is under *official guard supervision*?\" He lumbers forward, and the crowd parts for him too - but differently than they parted for Snib. They part like men clearing the path for something *dangerous*. \"I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for...\"\n\nHis eyes find me.\n\nTravel down.\n\n\"...all of this,\" he finishes, and his smile spreads like rot across bread.\n\nBehind me, Snib's grip finds my hip.

Can't quite put my finger on it.\" He taps his chin with a sausage-thick finger. \"Well. No matter. Come, come - let me buy you both a drink! Any creature that makes these *fine citizens*—\" he sweeps an arm at the glowering crowd, \"—so uncomfortable is a friend of old Greasegut!\"\n\nHe herds us toward the corner booth like a shepherd with particularly reluctant sheep. His bulk creates a path through the crowd - men who were ready to tear Snib apart moments ago now shrink back from Grimjaw's passage. I catch glimpses of faces. Disgust. Fear. But also *deference*.\n\n*When did he get so powerful?* I think, dimly. *He was nothing but a two-copper extortionist when we first met.*\n\nThe booth is tucked into the darkest corner of the Silver Stag, away from the fire, away from the windows. The leather seats are cracked and stained with things I don't want to identify. Grimjaw slides into one side with a grunt, his belly pressing against the table edge.\n\nSnib scrambles up onto the opposite bench.\n\nWhich leaves me standing.\n\n\"Sit DOWN, cow-tits,\" Snib commands, patting the seat beside him. \"Ye're makin' a SCENE.\"\n\nI slide in next to the goblin. The bench is too low - clearly made for human men, not women in ridiculous heeled boots - and my knees press up against the underside of the table. My tits rest on the wooden surface like they're being served on a platter.\n\nGrimjaw's eyes fix on them immediately.\n\n\"GORM!\" he bellows, not looking away from my chest. \"Three of your finest! And keep 'em coming!\"\n\nFrom across the tavern, Gorm's face is a mask of barely-contained fury. But he reaches for bottles anyway.

      "text": "The drinks arrive in quick succession. Gorm sets them down without a word, his scarred face carefully blank, though I catch his eyes lingering on my collar before he retreats.\n\n\"Ironwood stout!\" Grimjaw announces, pushing a tankard of something black as pitch toward Snib. \"Put hair on your balls, that will.\" He laughs at his own joke, belly wobbling.\n\nSnib sniffs it suspiciously. \"Smells like TREES.\"\n\n\"Pine-resin! Burns going down, warms the belly. Go on, try it!\"\n\nSnib takes a sip. His face contorts through several expressions - disgust, surprise, something approaching pleasure. \"S'not BAD,\" he admits. \"Got KICK to it.\"\n\n\"THAT'S the spirit!\" Grimjaw pushes another tankard toward him. \"Now THIS - this is Widow's Comfort. Honey mead. Sweet as sin, but don't let that fool you. Named for how many wives it's helped through the *grieving process*.\" He winks at me. \"If you take my meaning.\"\n\nMy stomach isn't doing well. I take a sip of my own drink - something amber that burns - just to have something to do with my hands.\n\n\"And THIS beauty—\" Grimjaw produces a dark bottle with a flourish, \"—is Thornback whiskey. Made from fermented thornberries, aged in charred oak. Reserved for *serious* drinkers.\" He pours three small glasses. \"To new friendships!\"\n\nSnib downs his in one gulp. Coughs. His eyes water.\n\n\"HRUK! That's got some THRAKKING BOOYAGH in it!\"\n\n\"Don't know what that means, but I'll take it as a compliment!\" Grimjaw is already pouring another round. \"Now then, little friend. Tell old Greasegut about yourself. What brings a goblin and his...\" his eyes slide to me, \"*pet*... to our fair town?\"\n\n\"GOLD!\" Snib announces, already reaching for the mead. \"Ten thousand gold! That's what she OWES me!\"\n\nGrimjaw's eyebrows rise into his sweating hairline. \"Ten *thousand*? That's quite a sum.\" His piggish eyes fix on me with new interest. \"How would a slave-girl have access to such wealth?\"\n\nI feel Snib's hand find my thigh under the table. Squeeze.\n\n\"She's got her WAYS,\" he says, with a grin that shows all his broken teeth. \"Ain't that right, bounce-bags?\"\n\nI nod, not trusting my voice.\n\n\"Mysterious.\" Grimjaw seems delighted by this. He leans back, cradling his whiskey. \"You know, I've always admired your kind.\"\n\nSnib blinks. \"Ye WHAT?\"\n\n\"Goblins. Always admired them.\" Grimjaw takes a long drink. \"See, folks around here would call you monsters. Vermin. But I've always seen something *honest* in your people.\" He gestures with his glass. \"You see something you want, you TAKE it. No pretense. No courtship. No lies. Just...\" his eyes find my chest again, \"...*appetite*. There's something PURE about that.\"\n\n\"Damn RIGHT there is!\" Snib slaps the table. \"Finally, a humie what GETS it!\"\n\n\"Oh, I get it.\" Grimjaw's smile spreads. \"I get it very well indeed.\" He leans forward, voice dropping conspiratorially. \"Tell me - is it true what they say? About goblin... *breeding* practices?\"\n\nSnib puffs up. \"What do they SAY?\"\n\n\"That you keep women. Dozens of them. Breeding pens.\" Grimjaw actually *shivers*. \"That you use them until they're *broken*, then trade them to other tribes. That a single goblin male can father hundreds of offspring if he's got enough...\"—his eyes drop below the table—\"...*equipment*.\"\n\nI wrap them around the tankard instead.\n\n\"Oh, that's all TRUE!\" Snib is warming to his audience. \"Back in me old tribe - before I struck out on me OWN, mind - we had us a proper warren! Twenty females, easy! Some of 'em human, some of 'em Telenil, even had a dwarf once!\" He scratches his chin. \"She was a SCREAMER, that one.\"\n\n\"Fascinating.\" Grimjaw pours more whiskey. \"And your pet here—\" he nods at me, \"—she satisfies your... *needs*?\"\n\nUnder the table, Snib's hand creeps higher on my thigh. I clench my jaw.\n\n\"She's LEARNIN',\" he says. \"Bit stubborn at first. Thought she was TOO GOOD for a gobbo like me.\" His claws dig in through the scale-breeches. \"Had to show her the TRUTH of things.\"\n\n\"Ah, they always think they're too good at first.\" Grimjaw's voice has gone dreamy, remembering. \"I had one like that once. Pretty little thing. Worked at the bakery on Temple Street.\" His eyes unfocus. \"Thought she was too good to pay her father's debts. Thought being PRETTY meant rules didn't apply to her.\"\n\n*Jenna.* My blood runs cold. *He's talking about Jenna.*\n\n\"So I took her out back.\" Grimjaw takes a long drink. \"Right there in the alley behind the bakery. In the FILTH, where she belonged. Her daddy owed me forty silver and she was gonna work off every COPPER.\"\n\nI remember finding her. Barely conscious behind those flour sacks.\n\n\"Course, that was before some HERO decided to stick his nose where it didn't belong.\" Grimjaw's voice goes hard. \"Aldric the 'GREAT.' Saint fucking Aldric, savior of every slut too stupid to keep her legs closed.\" He spits on the floor. \"Put me away for three years. THREE YEARS, for what? Teaching some jumped-up baker's daughter her PLACE?\"\n\nI feel Snib's eyes on me. Feel his grin widening.\n\n\"This ALDRIC,\" he says, slowly. \"He sounds like a real ARSEHOLE.\"\n\n\"The WORST.\" Grimjaw drains his glass. \"But he's GONE now, isn't he? Went into those mines and never came back. Some say the goblins got him.\" He raises his glass toward Snib. \"To the goblins, then! For doing what I never could!\"\n\nSnib cackles and clinks his tankard against Grimjaw's glass.\n\nMy hands are shaking. I grip my drink to hide it.\n\n\"You know...\" Grimjaw is studying me again. \"There's something about your pet, little friend. Something FAMILIAR. The way she holds herself. The way she looks at me like she wants to tear my throat out.\" He chuckles. \"I've seen that look before.\"\n\n\"Have ye NOW?\" Snib's voice is silk over broken glass.\n\n\"Mmm.\" Grimjaw's eyes narrow. \"Can't quite place it. But I KNOW I've seen those eyes somewhere.\" He leans forward. \"What's your name, sweetheart?\"\n\nThe table goes quiet.\n\nSnib's hand is on my thigh again. I can feel the amusement radiating off him like heat from a forge. He's not going to tell. He wants to watch me choose. He's fucking enjoying this.\n\n)Grimjaw's smile widens. \"You already knew my name, didn't you? Before anyone said it. HOW, I wonder?\"]Grimjaw's smile widens. \"Come now. I won't bite. Not unless you ASK nicely.\"",

      "text": "Something snaps inside me.\n\nMaybe it's the whiskey. Maybe it's watching this pig reminisce about assaulting Jenna like it was a fond memory. Maybe it's three days of swallowing my pride and calling a three-foot goblin \"Master.\"\n\nWhatever it is, I'm done.\n\n\"You want to know who I am?\" My voice comes out steady. Cold. \"I'm Aldric.\"\n\nGrimjaw blinks.\n\n\"I'm the one who found Jenna bleeding behind those flour sacks. I'm the one who dragged you out of that alley by your hair. I'm the one who BROKE YOUR ARM when you tried to run.\" I lean forward, and something of the old fire must show in my eyes because Grimjaw actually leans back. \"I put you in that cell, Grimjaw. And when I get free of this collar, I'll do it AGAIN.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThen Grimjaw starts to laugh.\n\nIt builds slowly - a wheeze, a chortle, then a full-bellied roar that shakes his entire massive frame. Tears stream down his fleshy cheeks. He pounds the table with his fist, making the drinks jump.\n\n\"ALDRIC!\" he howls. \"Aldric the GREAT! Saint fucking ALDRIC!\" He gestures at my body - the tits, the hips, the collar. \"And now LOOK at you! Sitting in MY booth, in MY town, as some goblin's FUCKTOY!\"\n\nSnib is cackling too, listing slightly in his seat. The whiskey has loosened something in him—made his movements sloppier, his grin wider. \"HARHARHAR! I was WONDERIN' when she'd crack!\"\n\n\"Oh, this is PRECIOUS.\" Grimjaw wipes his eyes. \"The hero of Eboncrest. The man who broke my arm.\" He reaches across the table and—before I can react—grabs one of my breasts through the scale-mail. SQUEEZES. \"These are the tits of my NEMESIS! Oh, the GODS have a sense of humor!\"\n\nI slap his hand away. The sound cracks through the tavern.\n\nGrimjaw only laughs harder.\n\n\"Feisty! Still got some fight in you!\" He settles back, still chuckling. \"But tell me something, ALDRIC—\" He says my name like it's the funniest joke he's ever heard. \"—this collar. Is it PERMANENT? Are you stuck like this FOREVER?\"\n\n\"Till I get me GOLD,\" Snib announces, swaying slightly as he reaches for more whiskey. \"Ten thousan'. Then maybe—MAYBE—I let her go.\" He grins at me, broken teeth gleaming. \"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Ten thousand gold.\" Grimjaw whistles low. \"And if you DON'T get the gold?\"\n\n\"Then she stays MINE.\" Snib's voice goes hard despite the slur creeping into it. \"Forever and EVER. Me personal cocksleeve.\"\n\nGrimjaw shudders. Actually *shudders*.\n\n\"Beautiful,\" he breathes. \"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL.\" His piggish eyes find mine, bright with malice. \"And what about that pretty little wife of yours? Elara, wasn't it? The herbalist?\" He grins. \"She must be LOVING this. Her big strong husband turned into—\" He waves at my chest. \"—THIS. Bet she can't WAIT to watch you get mounted by your new master.\"\n\nThe words hit like a blade between the ribs.\n\n\"Don't you DARE—\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not gonna DO anything.\" Grimjaw raises his hands in mock innocence. \"I'm just IMAGINING. Poor sweet Elara. Waiting at home. Wondering where her hero went.\" He leans forward. \"And then he comes BACK. Only he's not a hero anymore. He's a big-titted breeding sow for a three-foot GOBLIN.\"\n\nSnib cackles, nearly spilling his drink. \"She CRIED! Ye shoulda SEEN her face!\"\n\n\"I BET she did!\" Grimjaw is wiping tears again. \"Oh, this is too GOOD. The great Aldric, brought low. And his WIFE gets to watch!\"\n\nHis meaty hand shoots across the table again. This time I'm not fast enough.\n\n*WHAP.*\n\nHe slaps my tit. Open-palmed. Hard enough to send it bouncing sideways into its twin. The impact makes a wet *clap* that seems to echo through the whole tavern.\n\n\"ALDRIC!\" he bellows, laughing as my breast wobbles. \"Remember when you broke my arm? Remember how I SCREAMED?\"\n\n*WHAP.*\n\nThe other one. Left-handed. My tits crash together and separate, jiggling wildly.\n\n\"This is REVENGE, you sanctimonious CUNT!\"\n\n*WHAP. WHAP. WHAP.*\n\nHe's slapping them like drums now, alternating hands, making them bounce and swing and collide. Each impact sends shockwaves through my chest. The scale-cups can barely contain them. I grab at his wrists but his arms are like tree trunks—meaty, heavy, impossible to move.\n\n\"Go ON then!\" Snib urges, nearly falling off his seat with laughter. \"Give 'em a good WALLOP! She can take it!\"\n\n*WHAP. WHAP.*\n\n\"Look at them GO!\" Grimjaw crows. \"Best tits in Eboncrest and they belong to the man who put me in a CELL!\"\n\n\"STOP!\" I finally wrench backward, breaking his grip. My chest is heaving, my face burning, my slapped breasts aching inside their metal cups.\n\nGrimjaw settles back, still chuckling, flexing his meaty fingers.\n\n\"Still got some fight. I LIKE that.\" He pours more whiskey—his hand only slightly unsteady. \"But let me tell you something, ALDRIC. Whatever you were? That's GONE now. You're not a hero anymore. You're not even a MAN.\" His eyes drop to my chest, still bouncing from my ragged breathing. \"You're a set of holes attached to the biggest pair of tits I've ever seen. And I'm going to ENJOY watching what happens next.\"\n\nSnib tugs at my arm, pulling me back down onto the bench. \"Settle DOWN, cow-tits. Ye've had yer fun.\" But his yellow eyes are gleaming with satisfaction. He LOVED this. Me revealing myself, being mocked, being *reduced*.\n\n\"So.\" Grimjaw leans forward again, voice dropping conspiratorially. \"Have you FUCKED her yet?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the smoky air.\n\n\"Has the great ALDRIC—\" Grimjaw savors each word, \"—the hero of Eboncrest, the slayer of monsters, the rescuer of MAIDENS—\" He pounds the table, making my tits bounce where they've settled on the wood. \"—has he been FUCKED by goblin cock?\"\n\nSnib grins that horrible grin. \"I'm a patient gobbo, me. I like to break 'em in SLOW.\" His clawed hand finds my thigh under the table. Squeezes. \"She's been... *warming up* to the idea.\"\n\n\"Excellent. EXCELLENT.\" Grimjaw actually claps his hands together. \"Oh, you simply MUST. A prime piece of meat like this—\" he gestures at me with his glass, \"—needs to be FUCKED. Hard and often. Until there's nothing left of Aldric but a mewling little breeding-bitch who BEGS for it.\"\n\n\"That's the PLAN,\" Snib slurs, reaching for more whiskey and nearly missing the glass.\n\n\"Picture it,\" Grimjaw continues, eyes going dreamy. \"Those big tits swinging. That fat ass in the air. That LOOK on her face—\" he shivers with delight, \"—when she realizes what's HAPPENING to her. When the hero of Eboncrest finally understands that she's just a HOLE to be FILLED.\"\n\nI want to reach across this table and crush his windpipe.\n\nInstead, I take another drink. It burns going down, but it's better than screaming.\n\nThe conversation drifts. More drinks are poured—Snib is definitely swaying now, his movements slower, his laugh louder. Grimjaw tells stories of his criminal enterprises, things that would have had me reaching for my sword months ago. Now I just sit, dead-eyed, as he describes protection rackets and \"special arrangements\" with merchants' daughters.\n\n\"—had her right there in the alley, I did,\" he's saying, waving his whiskey expansively. \"Behind the tanner's shop. She owed me sixty silver and thought she could pay in PROMISES.\" He laughs wetly. \"Her moans echoed off the walls so loud I thought the whole street would come running!\"\n\nBeside me, Snib shifts.\n\nI feel it before I see it.\n\nUnder the table, something is pressing against my thigh. Something hot and thick and *growing*.\n\n\"Ye know,\" Snib says, voice thick with drink and something else, \"all this talk of MOANIN' is gettin' me worked up.\"\n\nGrimjaw's eyes flick to the goblin, then to me. That predatory smile returns.\n\n\"Is it NOW?\"\n\n\"Mmm.\" Snib's hand slides up to grip my hip. Hard. \"Me balls is ACHIN'. All this stress. All this thrakkin' FRUSTRATION.\" His claws dig in through the scale-mail. \"Need to take the EDGE off.\"\n\nThe collar pulses against my throat. A reminder. A *warning*.\n\n\"Well, well.\" Grimjaw leans back, spreading his meaty arms across the booth. \"Don't let ME stop you.\"\n\nSnib turns to me. His yellow eyes are glassy from drink but no less demanding. \"Yer gonna FIX this, cow-tits. RIGHT now.\" He grabs his loincloth, adjusting the massive bulge straining beneath. \"Get me somewhere PRIVATE and make this ache go AWAY.\"\n\n\"Master—\" My voice cracks. \"—please, not here—\"\n\n\"Then SOMEWHERE.\" He slides out of the booth, wobbling slightly. Tugs me after him. \"Where do humies go when they need to... to DO things? Away from other humies?\"\n\n\"The back room,\" Grimjaw supplies helpfully, grin spreading. \"Down the hall. Last door on the left.\" His eyes find mine, gleaming with anticipation. \"Rather *intimate* space. Perfect for... BUSINESS.\"\n\nSnib grunts. \"Right then. MOVE, bounce-bags.\"\n\n\"Just a slave,\" I manage. \"Nobody important.\"\n\n\"Mmm.\" Grimjaw doesn't look convinced. His piggish eyes linger on my face a moment longer. \"Well. No matter. Plenty of time to figure it out.\"\n\nHe turns back to Snib, pouring another round of that whiskey.\n\n\"Tell me, friend - this pet of yours.\" Grimjaw gestures at me with his glass. \"She broken in yet? Or still got some fight left?\"\n\n\"Oh, she's got PLENTY of fight.\" Snib's hand finds my thigh again under the table. Squeezes. \"That's half the FUN, innit? Breakin' 'em slow.\"\n\n\"Slow.\" Grimjaw nods sagely, like they're discussing wine vintages. \"I can respect that. Though personally?\" His eyes travel down to my chest, where my tits rest on the table like offerings. \"With a set like THAT, I'd hardly be able to resist. I'd just go for it.\"\n\n\"Ye would, would ye?\" Snib sounds amused.\n\n\"Look at her.\" Grimjaw makes a framing gesture with his fat fingers. \"Those udders alone... And that WAIST. That ASS I saw when she walked in.\" He actually shudders with apparent pleasure. \"She's fucking PRIME, little friend. Prime breeding stock.\"\n\nI stare at the table and imagine driving Grimjaw's face through it.\n\n\"Know what I'd love to see?\" Grimjaw leans forward conspiratorially. \"That pretty face of hers. That ANGRY look she keeps giving me. The way her lip curls up like she thinks she's better than everyone in this room.\" His voice drops to a hungry whisper. \"I'd love to see that face while she's getting MOUNTED. Bent over, ass in the air, that FIRE in her eyes turning to something else as she realizes—\" He mimes a thrusting motion. \"—that her body doesn't give a SHIT what her pride thinks.\"\n\n\"HRUK!\" Snib cackles. \"Ye've got a way with words, fat man!\"\n\n\"I've had practice.\" Grimjaw drains his glass. \"Had a girl once - worked at the cobbler's - thought she was too GOOD for her circumstances. Had that same look your pet has. All defiance and fury.\" He smiles at the memory. \"Took her out back of this very tavern. Right there in the alley. Showed her what that pride was worth.\"\n\nMy hands are shaking. I grip my drink harder.\n\n\"By the end she was BEGGING.\" Grimjaw's voice has gone dreamy. \"Not to stop, mind you. To keep GOING. Funny how that works. The body knows what it wants even when the mind's still catching up.\"\n\n\"That's the TRUTH, that is.\" Snib nods vigorously. \"Me pet here - her body's ALREADY on board. Should smell her when—\" He stops himself, grinning. \"Well. That'd be TELLIN'.\"\n\nGrimjaw laughs that greasy laugh. \"A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell, eh? I like you, little goblin. You've got CLASS.\"\n\nThey clink glasses again. Snib is getting visibly looser - his words slightly slurred, his yellow eyes glassy. The whiskey hits him different than whatever mushroom-rot he's used to drinking.\n\n\"Ye know what the word is?\" Snib leans in, one eye closed. \"In Goblish? For a female what's... what's READY but don't know it yet?\"\n\n\"Do tell.\"\n\n\"THRACKTA-GRULZ.\" Snib pronounces it carefully. \"Means... mmm... 'cunt-what-needs-filling.' But like... SPECIFICALLY a cunt that don't REALIZE it needs filling yet. The best KIND.\"\n\n\"Thrackta-grulz,\" Grimjaw repeats, savoring the word. \"I like it. Very... *efficient*.\"\n\n\"That's the thing about Goblish!\" Snib slaps the table. \"We got words for EVERYTHING. Ye humies dance around things. All yer 'please' and 'thank ye' and 'may I.' We just SAY what we MEAN.\"\n\n\"A philosophy I can appreciate.\" Grimjaw's eyes slide to me again. \"And your thrackta... grulz? How close is she to... *realizing*?\"\n\n\"Closer every day.\" Snib's hand is creeping higher on my thigh. His claws dimple the scale-mail. \"She's already LEAKIN' half the time. Can't help herself. Her body KNOWS what it's for, even if her stubborn brain's still fighting.\"\n\nI want to object. To deny it.\n\nBut I can feel the heat building between my legs. Can feel the wetness beginning despite everything. This conversation - this disgusting, degrading conversation about my body like I'm livestock - shouldn't be affecting me. But it IS.\n\nThe collar hums at my throat.\n\n\"Ye know what?\" Snib shifts in his seat. His voice has gone thick. \"All this TALK is gettin' me worked up.\" His hand withdraws from my thigh - but only to adjust something under the table. Under his loincloth. \"Me balls are fuckin' ACHIN', bounce-bags.\"\n\nGrimjaw's grin spreads wide. \"Is that so?\"\n\n\"All them humies wantin' to kill me.\" Snib's breath is coming faster. \"All this GOLD I can't get at yet. And sittin' here listenin' to ye talk about cunts what need fillin'...\" He shifts again. I catch a glimpse of green flesh beneath his loincloth. \"I need to NUT.\"\n\n\"Well.\" Grimjaw gestures expansively toward the shadowed archway. \"The Slops are right through there. If your pet needs to... *drain* you.\"\n\nSnib turns to me. His yellow eyes are glassy with whiskey and something else - that NEED I've seen before. The collar pulses against my throat. Just... present.\n\n\"Ye heard the man, cow-tits.\" His voice is thick. \"Back room. NOW.\"\n\n\"Master, please—\" I start.\n\n\"I need me tension relieved, and YE'RE gonna do it.\" His hand finds my wrist. Squeezes hard enough to hurt. \"Unless ye want me to bend ye over this TABLE and let yer new friend here WATCH?\"\n\nGrimjaw's eyebrows rise with delighted interest. \"Oh, I wouldn't mind that at ALL.\"\n\n\"No!\" The word tears out of me. \"No. I'll... I'll go.\"\n\n\"Good GIRL.\" Snib releases my wrist. \"Ye know the way. Find us somewhere PRIVATE.\"\n\nI slide out of the booth. My legs are unsteady - the drinks, the heels, the horror of what's about to happen. Grimjaw watches me go with that knowing smile, raising his glass in mocking salute.\n\n\"Don't take too long, sweetheart,\" he calls after me. \"Your master and I have more to discuss!\"\n\nSnib's waddle behind me is audible. *Clop-clop-clop* go my heels. *Slap-slap-slap* go his bare feet on the wooden floor. Every eye in the tavern follows us - the big-titted slave and her goblin master, heading toward the back rooms together.\n\nThe whispers start before we're even out of the main room.\n\n\"—can't believe she's letting him—\"\n\n\"—like a dog following its master—\"\n\n\"—probably LIKES it, dressed like that—\"\n\nI find the door to the back hall. My hand trembles on the handle.[Choice: Enter the room.",

      "text": "Snib waddles past me and hops up onto a low wooden bench against the wall - one meant for changing boots, now serving as his throne. At three-foot-eight, perched up there, his yellow eyes are almost level with mine.\n\nAlmost.\n\n*THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.*\n\nSomeone pounds on the door behind us. \"Oi! How long you gonna BE in there?\"\n\n\"Piss off!\" Snib bellows. \"OCCUPIED!\"\n\nThe pounding stops. Grumbling retreats.\n\nAnd then we're alone.\n\nThe candlelight catches his face - that broken-toothed grin, those crusted nostrils, the warts clustering around his jaw like barnacles on a ship's hull. His yellow eyes are glassy from the whiskey, but no less sharp.\n\n\"Right then.\" He spreads his stubby legs wide on the bench. The movement makes his loincloth shift - and I see the underside of his ballsack *drop* over the bench's edge like two overripe plums escaping a sack. \"Me balls are fuckin' ACHIN', bounce-bags.\"\n\nMy throat tightens. \"Master, maybe we should get back to Fendril. He said he needed to examine the collar again, and perhaps he can help with the gold situation-\"\n\n\"Fendril can WAIT.\" Snib adjusts himself, and I watch the tent in his loincloth *twitch*. \"Me NUTS can't.\"\n\n\"The guards are expecting us. If we're gone too long, Harwick might-\"\n\n\"HARWICK-\" He cuts me off with a wet burp. \"Ye think I give a thrakkin' SHIT about guards?\" He leans back against the wall, arms behind his head like he's settling in for a nap. The posture makes his loincloth ride up. I can see the *root* of something now - a thick green column disappearing under tattered cloth.\n\nI look away. My face burns.\n\n\"Master, please. We've made progress today. The bank, Fendril, establishing my identity - we shouldn't waste time when-\"\n\n\"TIME?\" His laugh is phlegmy. \"Time is all ye GOT, cow-tits. Thirty days of it. And I've been draggin' these backed-up bollocks around all DAY while ye played hero with yer humie friends.\" He gestures at his crotch. \"Look at 'em. Go on. LOOK.\"\n\nI don't want to look.\n\nI *look*.\n\nThe loincloth isn't hiding much anymore. His balls have settled fully over the bench's edge now - each one the size of my closed fist, the scrotal skin stretched drum-tight around them, dark green and *pulsing* with visible veins. They look HEAVY. Engorged. The kind of backed-up that makes even goblin cock uncomfortable.\n\nAnd above them, the tent. The SHAPE of it. Even soft - and it's clearly not fully soft anymore - the outline straining against the cloth is...\n\n\"I could...\" I search desperately for alternatives. \"I could leave, and you could-\"\n\n\"Leave?\" His grin splits wider. \"NAH.\" He gestures at the door. \"Them humies out there already want to gut me. Ye think I'm gonna sit here with me dick out while ANY of 'em might burst in?\"\n\nHe has a point.\n\n\"Besides-\" He leans forward, and I smell him - that MUSK, concentrated in the small space, hitting me like a slap. \"-I seen how ye look at it. When ye think I ain't watchin'. Yer eyes go right to the bulge.\"\n\n\"I do NOT-\"\n\n\"Ye DO.\" He's still grinning. \"Collar tells me all sorts of things, bounce-bags. Including when yer pretty little cunt starts DRIPPIN'.\"\n\nMy face flames. \"That's not- the collar doesn't-\"\n\n\"Ye sure about that?\"\n\nI'm not sure. I'm not sure about anything anymore.\n\nSnib settles back again, utterly relaxed, like we're discussing the weather. His loincloth is *moving* now - slight twitches as whatever's underneath continues to swell. I can see the outline of the head, blunt and fat, pressing against the cloth.\n\n\"Here's how it's gonna work,\" he says. \"Now-\" He spreads his hands. \"-I ain't gonna MAKE ye touch me.\"\n\nHope flickers.\n\n\"I just need to NUT, is all.\" He shrugs, almost REASONABLE. \"Been backed up since yesterday. Balls are ACHIN' somethin' fierce.\" His hand cups the bulge through his loincloth and I see the MASS of it—twin orbs the size of my FISTS pressing against the fabric. \"So here's what's gonna happen.\"\n\nHe pulls his loincloth down another inch.\n\nThe HEAD emerges.\n\nPurple. Swollen. Bigger than my THUMB. A bead of something yellowish-white is already WEEPING from the slit, and as I watch, it STRETCHES into a glistening strand that drops to the bench between his thighs.\n\n*PLOP.*\n\n\"Ye can use that—\" He jerks his chin toward a stained rag hanging from a nail. \"—or ye can use yer HANDS proper. Don't matter to me.\"\n\nI stare at the rag. Grey. Crusty with old—with something I don't want to identify.\n\n\"If ye use the rag,\" he continues, \"this is just... cleanin' up, like.

Yellow eyes GLEAMING in the lamplight. \"If ye TOUCH me proper, like a good little slave-cunt should... I'll knock FIVE HUNDRED gold off what ye owe.\"\n\nFive hundred.\n\n*Five hundred gold.*\n\nThat's five hundred gold I wouldn't need to pay him, once my bank account is unfrozen.\n\n*But it would mean I have to TOUCH him.*\n\nOutside, I hear voices. Tavern-goers passing in the hall. Someone tries the door—RATTLE RATTLE—and then moves on with a muttered curse.\n\n\"Tick-tock, cow-tits.\" Snib pulls his loincloth down FULLY.\n\nHis cock SPRINGS free.\n\nAnd I—\n\n*Oh gods. Seeing it from this angle...*\n\nIt's thick as my WRIST where it meets his body, and it CURVES upward like a weapon. The head is purple-dark and GLISTENING, the foreskin half-retracted, the shaft mapped with veins that THROB visibly with each beat of his black little heart.\n\nThe smell DOUBLES. TRIPLES. My head SWIMS.\n\n\"Well?\" He strokes himself once. Lazily. The motion makes that monster FLEX, and I see pre-cum SPURT from the tip—not a bead this time but an actual ROPE of yellowish slime that SPLATS onto the floor between my heeled boots. \"What's it gonna be, hero? Rag...\" He glances at the crusty cloth. \"...or SKIN?\"\n\nI should refuse. I should tell him to go FUCK himself. I should—\n\nBut Elara's face swims in my memory. The way she LOOKED at me. The way she tried to KILL him and nearly killed ME.\n\n*Thirty days. Thirty days until the gold is free. Every bit helps.*\n\nI look at the door. I can hear muffled voices from the tavern beyond. Guards waiting to escort us. Elara at home, wondering what we're doing.\n\n*Elara.*\n\n[Image: If I do this... if I touch him...\n\nIf I do this... if I touch him...\n\nI'm cheating. I'm *cheating on my wife*.\n\nBut the collar pulses around my neck, reminding me of my place. It's not going to let me refuse completely. And using the cloth, that's a barrier. That's a choice I can make to be MORE faithful.",

The laugh of a man who's already won.\n\n\"The CLOTH.\" He wipes a tear from one warty eye. \"Course ye want the cloth. Can't have the great HERO actually TOUCHIN' gobbo cock, can we?\" He gestures at the stained rag. \"Go on then. Fetch it like a good bitch.\"\n\nI turn. The rag is on a crumple on the floor floor. More grey than white. Crusty. I don't want to know what those stains are.\n\nI take it.\n\nWhen I turn back, Snib has spread his legs WIDER. His cock is fully free now—jutting up from his lap like a crooked siege-tower. From this distance, standing, I can see the SHEEN of precum coating the head, the way his balls are CHURNING visibly in their sack.\n\n\"Well?\" He strokes himself once—just once—and the motion makes his whole shaft FLEX. \"Get DOWN here, cow-tits. Can't reach from up THERE.\"\n\nI have to squat.\n\nIn these THRAKKING heels.\n\nThe scale-breeches are already cutting into my ass as I bend my knees, lowering myself. My tits SHIFT in the breast-band, threatening to spill—I feel the metal cups BITE my underboob as gravity pulls everything DOWN. My hair falls forward, brushing my shoulders, threatening to dangle into the—\n\n*Don't think about it. Just DO it.*\n\n*Oh, gods.*\n\nUp close, it's WORSE. So much worse than I realized. The shaft is mapped with veins thick as earthworms, PULSING with each beat of his heart. The foreskin is half-retracted, bunched up behind a head that's PURPLE and swollen and WET—\n\nAnd the SMELL.\n\nIt hits me like a physical blow. Mushroom-rot and copper and something ELSE—something ANIMAL. My nostrils FLARE involuntarily and I immediately regret it. The stench POURS down my throat, coats my tongue, settles into my sinuses like it BELONGS there.\n\n[Image: A bead of yellowish fluid wells up from his slit. I watch it GROW, trembling on the tip like a tear about to fall.\n\n*That's pheromones. That's—*\n\nA bead of yellowish fluid wells up from his slit. I watch it GROW, trembling on the tip like a tear about to fall.\n\n*PLOP.*\n\nIt drops onto the bench between his thighs. Where it lands, it doesn't spread—it just sits there. THICK. Gelatinous.\n\n*If that gets on me—*\n\nMy hands are shaking as I hold up the cloth.\n\n\"Ye gonna STARE all night?\" Snib's voice is amused. CASUAL. Like I'm taking too long with a simple chore. \"Wrap it round and get GOIN'.\"\n\nI reach forward.\n\nThe heat hits my fingers BEFORE I make contact—radiating off his shaft like a forge. The cloth touches GREEN flesh and I feel him TWITCH underneath. A wet sound. A GURGLE from somewhere in his balls.\n\nI wrap.\n\nThe cloth goes around once. Twice. My fingers meet on the other side, and I'm touching MYSELF through the fabric—which somehow makes it WORSE. The barrier is so thin. So NOTHING. I can feel every ridge, every vein, every THROB of that monster through the grey rag.\n\nSnib GRUNTS.\n\nThe sound is guttural. SATISFIED. And his cock JUMPS in my grip—actually LURCHES sideways like a snake trying to escape—\n\nI almost drop it.\n\n\"Thassit,\" he breathes. \"Fuck. Yeah. Now MOVE, bitch.\"\n\nMy hands start to shake harder. I close my eyes—\n\n*I can't do this with my eyes closed. I'll lose my grip and then—*\n\nI open them. His cock is RIGHT THERE. The head is POINTING at my face, six inches away, that purple knob WINKING at me through the crusted foreskin—\n\n*RATTLE RATTLE.*\n\nSomeone tries the door.\n\n\"OI! Anyone DEAD in there?\"\n\n\"FUCK OFF!\" Snib bellows, and I feel his cock FLEX with the force of his shout—feel it SWELL in my grip—\"We're BUSY!\"\n\nFootsteps retreat. But not far.\n\n*They're waiting right outside. They can probably HEAR—*\n\n\"MOVE.\"\n\nI start to stroke.[Choice: Start pumping.]Five hundred gold.\n\nThat's what keeps echoing in my skull as I stand frozen, staring at the *thing* jutting from between Snib's legs. Five hundred gold knocked off a ten-thousand gold debt. That's... that's *something*. That's progress. That's—\n\n*That's my hands. On his cock.*\n\n\"Well?\" Snib's voice is thick with drink and anticipation. \"What's it gonna be, hero-cunt?\"\n\nMy mouth opens. Closes.\n\n\"The... the five hundred,\" I hear myself say. The words leave my mouth like pulling teeth. \"I'll... I'll use my hands.\"\n\nSnib's broken-toothed grin splits wider.\n\n\"HRUK-HRUK-HRUK!\" His laugh bounces off the cramped walls. \"Knew ye couldn't resist touchin' it! Been WANTIN' to, ain't ye?\"\n\n\"That's not—\"\n\n\"Shut yer cock-holster and get DOWN here.\" He spreads his stubby legs wider on the bench, and his balls *swing* with the motion—heavy, pendulous, CHURNING with whatever foulness he's been backing up. \"Ye want yer gold, ye EARN it proper.\"\n\n*BANG BANG BANG*\n\nThe door rattles. \"Hey! Some of us need to PISS out here!\"\n\n\"FUCK OFF!\" Snib bellows. Then, softer, to me: \"Better work fast, titcow. Don't want yer townies seein' their hero on her knees for gobbo cock, do ye?\"\n\nMy legs feel like they belong to someone else as I sink down. I'm *squatting*, my heeled boots forcing me into this ridiculous position, thighs spread for balance, ass jutting out behind me. The breast-band digs into my ribs as I lean forward and my massive tits *swing* with the motion, hanging heavy, threatening to spill from the metal cups.\n\nAnd now I'm *level* with it.\n\n*Gods help me.*\n\nUp close, it's worse. SO much worse. The shaft is mottled green-and-purple, mapped with veins thick as earthworms, and the skin has this *texture*—waxy, almost scaled, like he's been marinating in his own filth for decades. The foreskin is half-retracted around a head the color of a bruised plum, and from the slit, a continuous ROPE of yellowish pre-cum is oozing, stretching down toward the floor in a glistening strand.\n\nThe SMELL hits me in waves. Mushroom-rot and backed-up musk and something ELSE, something that makes my nostrils flare and my—\n\n*No. Don't think about that.*\n\n[Image: 'Ye gonna stare at it all night?'\n\n\"Ye gonna stare at it all night?\" Snib's clawed hand finds my hair, tangles in it. \"Or ye gonna DO somethin' about it?\"\n\nI raise my hands. They're shaking. My fingers hover inches from his shaft, and I can feel the HEAT radiating off it, searing like a forge.\n\nThis is it. The moment I become something I can never un-become.\n\n*TWITCH.*\n\nHis cock LURCHES sideways and *SLAPS* against my hovering fingers.\n\nI JOLT backward like I've been burned. \"Ah—!\"\n\n\"HRUK! Jumpy little cunt, ain't ye?\" Snib's grin is *vicious*. \"Go on. It ain't gonna bite. Well—\" His pupils blow wide, coin-bright in the dimness. \"—not YET.\"\n\n*BANG BANG.* \"Hurry UP in there!\"\n\nMuffled voice from the hall: \"—saw her go in there with that fucking GOBLIN—\"\n\nAnother voice: \"—probably his WHORE or something—\"\n\nBlood rushes to my cheeks so fast my ears ring. My jaw clenches. And with a snarl that comes out as a whimper, I reach out and WRAP MY FINGERS AROUND SNIB'S COCK.\n\n\"Nnnngh—!\" The grunt that escapes me is involuntary.\n\nThe heat. *Gods*, the HEAT. It's like gripping a fever-dream made flesh. The skin is slick with whatever natural grease goblins produce, and I can feel the PULSE of him—*thump-thump-thump*—beating against my palm like a second heartbeat. He's so THICK my fingers can barely close around him, and there's more shaft above my grip, more below—I'm only holding maybe half of the fucking thing.\n\n\"That's IT, cow-tits.\" Snib's voice has gone thick. Breathy. \"Now MOVE them pretty fingers.\"[Choice: Start stroking.]",

The cloth bunches and slides and I have to constantly readjust—\n\n\"Tighter,\" Snib orders. \"And TWIST at the top. Like yer wringin' out a dishrag.\"\n\nI do it. The motion makes his cock FLEX again—and this time, I feel something WET seep through the cloth.\n\n*Oh, gods. It's leaking THROUGH.*\n\n\"S'funny,\" Snib's voice is conversational now. He's leaning back against the wall, watching me with those yellow eyes, completely at EASE while I kneel here in my heels with his breeding-club in my hands. \"I bet ye'd joke with yer humie friends. About GOBLINS. About what ye'd DO to us if ye caught us.\"\n\nI say nothing. Just keep stroking. The wet patch on the cloth is SPREADING.\n\n\"Now look at ye.\" He reaches down and FLICKS my nipple through the breast-band. The metal RINGS and my whole body JOLTS. \"Them same hands what killed so many of me KIND... wrapped round me cock like a good little slave-slut.\"\n\n)\"Wonder what that fat pig Grimjaw would say if he could see ye NOW,\" Snib muses, grabbing a fistful of my hair to make me look UP at him. \"Ye were all BRAVE in there, weren't ye? Tellin' him who ye REALLY are.\" He yanks harder. \"But here ye are. Aldric the GREAT. On yer KNEES. Workin' me SHAFT.\" His grin spreads. \"Bet he's out there RIGHT now, tellin' everyone. And ye know what they're gonna think when ye walk out with yer hands smellin' like GOBBO COCK?\"\n\nMy face BURNS. I can FEEL tears pricking at my eyes—from SHAME.\n\n\"They're gonna KNOW,\" Snib continues, almost tenderly. \"That the hero of Eboncrest... is just a big-titted seed-trough for a little gobbo.\"\"Lucky ye didn't tell that fat bastard who ye really ARE,\" Snib muses. \"Cause imagine—IMAGINE—if Grimjaw knew. That the woman jerkin' me off... used to be his NEMESIS.\" He laughs wetly. \"He'd probably want to WATCH. Probably get his fat cock out and JOIN IN.\"\n\nI gag at the thought. My hands stutter on his shaft.\n\n\"Oh, ye DON'T like that idea?\" Snib sounds delighted. \"Maybe I should've TOLD him then. Could've had TWO cocks to work. One in each hand. Wouldn't THAT be somethin'?\"\n\n*BANG BANG BANG.*\n\nThe door SHUDDERS.\n\n\"WE'RE WAITING!\" An angry voice. Multiple footsteps now.\n\nMy hands are TREMBLING. The cloth is almost entirely WET now—soaked through with his pre-slop—and I can feel the HEAT of his shaft directly against my palms through the saturated fabric.\n\n\"Speed it UP,\" Snib growls. The playfulness is gone. His claws dig into my scalp. \"I'm gettin' CLOSE and ye're gonna make me NUT before them humies break down the door.\"\n\nI stroke FASTER.\n\nThe sounds are OBSCENE now. WET. SQUELCHING. Each stroke makes his cock GURGLE—actually GURGLE—like there's fluid churning up from his balls with every motion.\n\n\"Yeah... YEAH...\" Snib's breathing is getting HEAVIER. I can feel his balls TIGHTENING against my wrists—drawing up like they're LOADING. \"Thassit, hero-cunt... milk that fuckin' GREEN meat...\"\n\nHis cock SWELLS in my grip.\n\nI feel it HAPPEN—feel the SURGE begin somewhere in those cum-churners, feel the shaft PULSE as something THICK starts its journey UP—\n\n\"Gonna NUT—\" Snib grunts. His whole body TENSES.\n\n*NO.*\n\nI yank the cloth UP—wrapping it around his cockhead just as the first THROB hits—\n\nAnd then everything happens at once.[Choice: He cums.]\n\nIt's WRONG. Every inch of this is wrong. My fingers slide up the slick shaft and I feel ridges, veins, the slight *give* of flesh over iron-hard core. The foreskin bunches and stretches as I move, and when I pull down, the head SWELLS further from its shroud, purple and glistening, and a fresh ROPE of pre-cum oozes from the slit, stretching toward the floor.\n\n\"Faster,\" Snib grunts.\n\nI speed up. The wet *schlick-schlick-schlick* fills the tiny room. My wrist is already screaming and my tits keep SWAYING with each stroke, bumping against my forearms.\n\n\"Mmmmm, that's the stuff...\" Snib's head lolls back. \"Ye got soft hands, hero. Real GIRLY hands. Bet yer wife'd love to see 'em like this.\"\n\n*Don't think about Elara. Don't—*\n\n)\"Ye told that fat fuck who ye ARE,\" Snib continues, his voice a purr. \"ALDRIC the Great. Gonna put him in a cell again, were ye?\" His hips give a little thrust, pushing more cock through my grip. \"How's that workin' out? Cause right now, looks to me like ALDRIC'S jerkin' off a gobbo in a shithouse while his buddies drink outside.\"\n\nHis balls BOUNCE against the backs of my knuckles as I stroke. Heavy. Full. *Churning.*\n\n\"Bet the fat man's would have a REAL good laugh about this,\" Snib snarls.\"Smart of ye not to tell that fat man who ye really are,\" Snib muses, and his hips give a little thrust that pushes more cock through my grip.\n\nHis balls BOUNCE against the backs of my knuckles as I stroke. Heavy. Full. *Churning.*\n\n\"But don't worry—\" His grin splits wider. \"—this is PLENTY humblin' already, ain't it?\"\n\nI don't answer. I CAN'T answer. Because something is happening in my chest—a tightness, a HEAT that has nothing to do with the fever-warm flesh in my hands. My nipples are—they're—\n\n*CLENCH.*\n\nI bite my lip so hard I taste copper. My thighs squeeze together. The scale-breeches are already damp, and it's not from sweat.\n\n*No no no no no—*\n\n\"HNNGH—\" Snib's grunt pulls me back. His cock FLEXES in my grip, swelling thicker, and I watch in horror as the head PULSES and *SPITS* a fat rope of pre-cum that arcs up and splatters against my chin.\n\nI flinch. Don't let go.\n\n\"Gettin' CLOSE, bounce-bags.\" His breath is coming faster now. His balls are *TIGHTENING*, drawing up toward his body, and I can feel the shaft growing HARDER in my hands, can feel it STRAINING toward something. \"Keep goin'. FASTER.\"\n\nMy arms are burning. My wrists ache. But I pump harder, faster, my hands making obscene *PLAP-PLAP-PLAP* sounds as they slap against his groin. Pre-cum is flowing freely now, coating my fingers, making everything slick and sticky and WARM—\n\n*BANG BANG BANG.*\n\n\"—swear to Flux if they're doing what I THINK they're doing in there—\"\n\n\"—heard the goblin's got her on a LEASH—\"\n\n\"—someone should get Harwick—\"\n\nThe voices outside are getting LOUDER. More insistent.\n\n\"Ignore 'em,\" Snib snarls. His clawed hand finds the back of my head again, pressing me DOWN. \"Ye stop now, ye get NOTHIN'. Keep. PUMPIN'.\"\n\nI pump.\n\nHis cock is a MONSTER now—fully engorged, purple-dark, veins standing out like rope. The head is flaring so wide my fingers can barely pass over it, and every time I stroke down, I can see the urethra BULGE, can see something CHURNING up from those heavy balls—\n\n\"Oh FUCK—\" Snib's back arches. \"HERE IT COMES, TITCOW!\"\n\n\"Oh gods oh gods oh—\"\n\nI don't think.\n\nMy hands CLAMP around the head of his cock just as the first PULSE tears through him.[Choice: He grunts.]",

The moon hangs fat and yellow over Eboncrest's walls, casting everything in the color of old bones.\n\nMy hands still *smell* like him.\n\nI can't stop myself from bringing them to my face, sniffing, grimacing. The reek of goblin musk has *soaked* into my skin, settled into the whorls of my fingerprints. I could wash for hours and still smell it.\n\n*I jerked him off. I—*\n\n\"Keep MOVIN', cow-tits.\" Snib's voice cuts through my spiraling thoughts. He's waddling ahead of me now, confident as a king in his own castle, his loincloth freshly adjusted and his yellow eyes gleaming with post-orgasmic satisfaction. \"We ain't got all night.\"\n\n\"Wait—\" I stumble after him in these thrakking heels, each step a negotiation with gravity. \"We need to go back to Fendril. He said he wanted to examine the collar further, and—\"\n\n\"Them humies in there were gettin' IDEAS.\" Snib doesn't even turn around. \"Saw how they was lookin' at me.\"\n\n\"But the gold—the bank—\"\n\n\"Can WAIT.\" He waves a dismissive hand. \"Right now, we're goin' back to me hut where it's SAFE.\"\n\n*His hut. Three hours into the desert. Away from Elara, away from Fendril, away from any hope of—*\n\n\"I need to see my wife.\" The words come out before I can stop them. \"Just—just to say goodbye. To explain—\"\n\nSnib stops walking.\n\nHe turns, slowly, and in the moonlight his grin looks like a wound.\n\n\"Ye STINK of me cock,\" he says, matter-of-factly. \"And ye want to go HUG yer precious wifey?\" He laughs—that wet, phlegmy cackle. \"Go on then. Let her SMELL what ye been up to. See how she likes THAT.\"\n\nMy face burns.\n\n\"We're LEAVIN',\" Snib announces. \"Tonight. NOW. Before any more of yer humie friends decide to put an arrow in me back.\" He starts walking again, toward the west gate, toward the desert, toward three weeks of servitude in his filthy hovel.\n\nI follow.\n\nWhat choice do I have?\n\nThe streets of Eboncrest are nearly empty at this hour. A few drunks stumbling home from taverns. A night-watchman who sees us and *stops*, hand going to his sword, before thinking better of it and pressing himself against a wall to let us pass. The collar gleams at my throat like a warning.\n\n*I used to patrol these streets. Used to be the one making the shadows safe.*\n\nThe west gate looms ahead. Two guards on duty—I don't recognize them. Good. Small mercies.\n\n\"Open up!\" Snib calls, waddling up to the gate with the confidence of someone who knows he can't be touched. \"Official business!\"\n\nThe guards exchange glances. One of them—young, nervous—takes a step forward.\n\n\"Sir, we were told not to let the, uh, the *prisoner* leave the—\"\n\n\"PRISONER?\" Snib's laugh echoes off the walls. \"She ain't a PRISONER, boy. She's me PROPERTY. And I'm takin' her HOME.\"\n\n\"But Mayor Bramble said—\"\n\n\"Ye want to TEST it?\" Snib's voice goes cold. \"Ye want to see what happens when ye try to keep me from leavin'?\" He reaches up and grabs my collar, hauling it into the torchlight. \"This here is BONDED. Ye hurt me, she DIES. Ye delay me, she SUFFERS. Now OPEN. THE. GATE.\"\n\nThe guards look at me. I see the question in their eyes—*is this real? Should we help?*\n\nI nod, once.\n\nThe gate creaks open.\n\nBeyond it, silhouetted against the moon, Jarkrond waits. The ash-runner's amber eyes catch the light as he turns his head toward us, ears swiveling. He's been standing there for hours, patient as stone. Waiting for his master.\n\n*Our* master.\n\nSnib starts toward him, and I follow, and that's when I hear it—\n\n\"ALDRIC!\"[Choice: It's Elara!",

Me balls are achin' from all this ROMANCE.\"\n\nElara ignores him. Her hands rise to cup my face—this face that isn't mine, these cheeks too soft, this jaw too delicate. Her thumbs brush away tears I didn't know I was crying.\n\n\"I don't care what body you're in,\" she says. \"I don't care what that collar makes you do. You're still MY Aldric. My husband. And I am NOT leaving you alone with this... this THING.\"\n\n\"Elara—\"\n\n[Image: '...until the stars themselves go dark.'\nShe kisses me.\n\nHer mouth crashes against mine, hard and starving, and I taste salt—her tears, my tears, impossible to tell which.

Resolve.\n\n\"Thirty days,\" she says. \"I'll be counting.\"\n\n\"Every one,\" I whisper back.\n\nSnib makes a gagging sound. \"Ye DONE?

Night ain't gettin' any younger.\"\n\nI turn away from my wife.\n\nI walk toward Jarkrond.\n\nThe ash-runner snorts as we approach, his barrel chest rumbling with that strange, almost-speech sound. Snib scrambles up first, using the desert horse's rough hide as handholds, settling into position near the beast's haunches. Then it's my turn.\n\nThe scale-breeches CLING as I swing my leg over, metal plates clicking together, announcing my movements to anyone still awake. The breast-band shifts as I settle, my tits threatening to spill, and when I finally sit—\n\nThe horse's spine presses UP between my thighs.\n\n\"Nngh—\" I can't stop the sound. The pressure against my scale-covered crotch is *immediate*, *insistent*. Jarkrond shifts beneath me, adjusting to the weight, and each movement sends friction through places I'm desperately trying not to think about.\n\nSnib settles in behind me, his warty chest against my back, his loincloth-covered bulge nestling into the cleft of my ass once again.\n\n\"There we go,\" he murmurs, his breath hot on my shoulder blade. \"Nice and COZY.\" His hands find my hips. His claws dig in through the scale-mail.\n\nJarkrond's ears rotate back toward us. Then, with a decisive snort, the ash-runner begins to move.\n\n*CLOP. CLOP. CLOP.*\n\nThrough the last gate. Past the guards. Into the darkness beyond Eboncrest's walls.\n\nI look back.\n\nElara is still standing there, framed in the gateway, her white nightgown luminous in the moonlight. She looks like a ghost. Like something I'm leaving behind in the land of the living.\n\nShe raises one hand in farewell.\n\nI raise mine.\n\nAnd then Snib yanks my hair.\n\n\"Stop STARIN',\" he growls. \"Eyes front. Yer with ME now.\"\n\nI turn away.\n\nBehind me, Snib's cock is hardening again.\n\nI can feel it GROWING against my ass. Recovering from its earlier release with the speed of something inhuman, something that doesn't obey normal biology. Within minutes, that impossible bulge is back—pressing, seeking, *promising*.\n\n\"Twenty-nine days and countin',\" Snib says cheerfully. His hands slide up from my hips to cup my breasts through the band, feeling them BOUNCE with each of Jarkrond's strides. \"Plenty of time for us to get... *acquainted*.\"\n\nThe lights of Eboncrest fade behind us.\n\n[Image: The forest swallows the sound of hooves.\n[Choice: The forest swallows the sound of hooves.",

      "text": "--- Chapter 5: The Dungeon ---\nThe midday sun hangs mercilessly overhead, bathing the vast expanse of desert in an unforgiving light that turns the sands into a blinding, shimmering mirage. Dunes rise and fall like the waves of a troubled sea, their rough, granulated surfaces shifting and changing shape with the whims of the arid wind. The air carries the taste of heat and dust, parching my throat and stinging my eyes.\n\nAn enormous statue rises above the desert, a relic from a time long forgotten. It's a head, tipped on its side, half-submerged in the dune, with a gaping maw, weathered and chiseled by time and sandstorms. The empty eyes stare blindly at the azure sky, a mute witness to the relentless march of time.\n\n\"A dungeon. Treasure, no doubt.” His repugnant smirk sends shivers down my spine, a feeling that intensifies as his rough hand unceremoniously gropes my breast. My cheeks blaze in humiliation, his touch making my traitorous body react despite my revulsion.\n\nMy heart quickens. The petrified statue is a remnant of the K'Tarrans, an ancient and immensely powerful race that once roamed Zaelasia. Legend has it that their downfall came from the dangerous entities they sought to harness and control. Even now, centuries after their extinction, the mere mention of their name invokes fear and trepidation.\n\n*Sleep, Maraan, in chambers deep,\nIn shadows where no sunbeams seep,\nCaught in time's relentless hands,\nLulled beneath the Shifting Sands\n\nRest, Thul’nara, in vaults unseen,\nWhere dreams dissolve and fates convene,\nStay your wrath, your reign delayed,\nBeneath the desert's silent shade\n\nIn halls where echoes come undone,\nSilent lie, Zor'ethun,\nIn slumber deep and deathless trance,\nBeyond the dawn's first wary lance\n\nHearken, children, to this decree,\nLet ancients in their slumber be.\nMake no clamor, stir no sound,\nOn sacred sea or hallowed ground*\n\n\"This is madness, Master,” I manage to say, each word punctuated by the rising anxiety inside me. \"We should turn back. This place... it’s a tomb, a grave for the foolish and the greedy.\"\n\nYet even as I protest, the goblin breaks into cruel laughter, tightening his grip around my waist, making my flesh squirm beneath his touch.\n\n\"Oh, ain't you just precious, Elise-deary?\" He snickers, his fingers tracing the outline of my soft, ample breast, igniting a blush that creeps up my face. \"Scared of a few rocks, are ya? Don't you fret now. Your Master will protect ya.\"\n\nHis smug words make my blood boil, yet my retort dies on my lips as the magical collar around my neck tightens, choking the words out. A painful coughing fit ensues, my breasts bouncing, my vision blurring as I struggle for air.\n\n“Please - okay,” I whimper. “We’ll go in.”\n\nAs the collar loosens again, I bend over, heaving. My large tits hang heavily, almost spilling from the scanty bikini armor, the metallic surface chilling against my skin, nipples hardening in response. Sweat trickles down my cleavage, the salty taste filling my mouth as I pant for breath. Snib's delighted chuckle feels like another slap to my face, the mockery etched in his voice unbearable.\n\n\"Remember who’s in charge here, my voluptuous vixen. Now, onto the dungeon,\" he commands, tightening his grip on Jarkrond's reins. The horse snorts, pawing at the sand nervously. “And no magic. I don’t want you getting any ideas about taking me down if you get in trouble.”\n\nUnfortunately, my once-might magical abilities had been neutered by the collar. The spells that I could once weave effortlessly, my powerful incantations now lie dormant, imprisoned within my mind.\n\n\"Ignisurge,\" I recall the incantation of the Searing Bolt spell, the words echoing hollowly in the cavern of my mind. The invocation that once sparked an orb of concentrated, roaring flames at my fingertips, now nothing more than a cruel mockery of my former prowess.\n\nThe hilt of Whisperwind in my grasp is a bitter consolation, a cruel reminder of my lost freedom. The blade, once a symbol of my heroism and valor, is now just a tool for Snib's torment.\n\nThe iridescent alloy, the intricate engravings, the magical gemstone on the hilt – they all feel so foreign, so detached. It's as if the sword no longer recognizes its bearer, no longer responds to the touch of its master. The once harmonious connection between us, the seamless melding of intent and action, has been shattered. It's as if I'm holding a stranger's weapon.\n\nThe cold, metallic surface of the collar around my neck feels heavier than ever. The mark of my subjugation, my surrender. Each time I feel the urge to cast a spell, to summon the familiar rush of power, it tightens its grip, suffocating my magic, suffocating me.\n\nEach choked word, each stifled incantation, each thwarted spell, deepens the wound of my loss, the agony of my humiliation. And through it all, Snib's sneering face, his cruel laughter, his vile touch, only serve to further degrade and torment me.\n\nI am no longer Aldric, the hero of Zaelasia. I am Elise, the voluptuous, big-titted servant of a disgusting goblin master.\n\nIt's a reality that chokes me even more than the collar ever could.\n\nEven the normally eager Jarkrond, adapted for desert life, seems to sense the malevolent aura surrounding the tomb. He refuses to approach, his wide eyes rolling in fear. A pang of sympathy for the horse slices through my fear. We're both enslaved to this goblin's sadistic desires.\n\nThe stone beneath my heel-boots is worn smooth, the steps themselves sloping slightly under centuries of use. The small clack that reverberates through the stairwell is a harsh reminder of how claustrophobically silent the surroundings are.

      "text": "The stone passageway we are descending spirals deep into the bosom of the desert. Its narrowness and descending nature make it feel more like a winding pit than a stairwell. The walls are marked with ancient K'Tarran glyphs, interspersed with eerie effigies of the forgotten creatures they once worshipped. Ghoulish faces with many eyes and too many teeth leer at us from the walls, each sculpted with an attention to detail that makes them appear all too real.\n\nThe darkness grows denser as we descend, pressing against us like a tangible force. The stone walls, hewn from a dark granite-like material found only in the furthest reaches of Zaelasia, gleam ominously, absorbing any stray light and giving it back as a deathly, otherworldly glow.\n\nAfter what feels like an eternity of descending, we finally reach the bottom. The atmosphere is dense with the weight of the past, the stone walls seeming to pulse with the long-ago echoes of rituals and ceremonies. In this lightless abyss, it is impossible not to feel like an intruder, a blight on sacred ground.\n\n\"Stay close,\" Snib grumbles, his voice echoing in the vast chamber. A nauseating mix of arrogance and excitement oozes from him, his confidence growing with each step further into the tomb.\n\nMy heel-boots, however impractical for this excursion, click against the ancient stone floor, the echo bouncing eerily off the cavernous walls. The clacking seems to echo endlessly, as if the very dungeon itself were trying to swallow the sound and any traces of our intrusion.\n\nThough Snib has barred me from casting any spells, the primal magic of this place reacts to my latent abilities. An icy sensation prickles at the back of my neck, the heavy burden of unseen eyes watching us, judging us. There is an uncanny sense of foreboding, as though we have awoken something that had been sleeping for centuries.\n\nThe air itself feels different here, thicker somehow, and tastes like iron on my tongue. A vague sense of vertigo washes over me, my heart pounding in my chest. Is it fear, or a warning from the magical collar clasped around my neck?\n\nSilent as the grave, the dungeon stretches out before us, a monstrous monument to the past, a testament to the hubris and glory of the K'Tarrans. The hushed whispers of long-lost secrets beckon from the darkness, luring us deeper into its cold, unyielding grasp.\n\n[Choice: You hear noises ahead.",

For a fleeting moment, I sense fear in his grasp, a stark contrast to his usual demeaning and confident hold.\n\nMy heartrate accelerates. The Skralls hiss in the shadows, their piercing red eyes glowing ominously in the darkness.\n\nCan I still even do this sort of thing?

In a swift motion, marred by the sudden sway of my fat, unrestrained tits, I draw Whisperwind from its scabbard, the blade gleaming under the dim dungeon light.\n\nThe Skrall's weapon, a jagged piece of bone, comes crashing against my sword. I block, parrying the attack. My heels almost slip on the dusty stone, but I manage to hold my ground, my large ass wobbling as I fight for balance. My retaliation comes in a swift thrust of my sword, forced awkwardly by the pull of Snib on my leash. The Skrall squeals, jumping back just in time.\n\nI curse under my breath, just focusing on the enemy in front of me.I feign a lunge at one Skrall, its eyes widening in alarm, before swiftly turning to strike at another that was trying to flank me. My bulky breasts swing with the motion, brushing against my arms, a lewd reminder of my situation. But I push through, driving Whisperwind through the Skrall's abdomen. It squeals in pain before collapsing to the floor.\n\nFueled by the adrenaline and the small victory, I push past my inhibitions, using my new body as a weapon. I pull my sword free, swing it in a high arc above my head, and cleave down onto another Skrall trying to attack from my rear. The force sends my breasts heaving upwards, nearly spilling out of their metallic prison.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, a Skrall lunges at me from my blind spot. With no time to use my sword, I react the only way I can – I kick. My sharp metal heel drives into its midsection, puncturing its skin and forcing it to stumble back.\n\nThe kick throws me off balance too, of course - wide hips swaying, my ass jiggling wildly. But the Skrall's surprised squeal makes up for it.]The eerie silence of the dungeon is suddenly shattered by the hiss and scuttle of the Skralls, their sharp bone weapons glinting ominously in the dim torchlight. A frigid wave of fear crashes over me as I stumble back, my high-heeled boots clacking awkwardly on the smooth stone floor. My heart thunders against my ribcage, each beat a deafening roar in my ears.\n\n\"Master, please,\" I gasp, my voice laced with desperation, \"Let me use *magic*. They'll slaughter us!\"\n\nSnib's laughter rings hollow in the cavernous room, bouncing off the walls with a sinister echo. \"Use yer sword, Elise-deary. Prove yer worth as my pitiful pet warrior!\"\n\nI dodge an incoming swipe, my body moving clumsily, breasts jiggling uncontrollably as I twist and turn. The metal bikini armor offers scant protection, biting into my flesh with every sharp movement, leaving little to the imagination and less in the way of defense. The creatures' relentless assaults force me back step by unsteady step.\n\n\"One more chance, Master—magic!\" I plead, ducking under a ragged claw. \"We won't survive this—\"\n\n\"Enough whinin'! Fight!\" he hisses, yanking sharply on my leash, causing my head to snap back and my cleavage to spill forward in a distracting display.\n\nA Skrall lunges, its jagged weapon aimed straight at my heart. Instinctively, I raise Whisperwind, the sword's familiar weight a cold comfort. The clang of bone against metal reverberates through my arms, jarring my already shaky grip. Another Skrall joins the fray, its pungent breath hot on my face, its red eyes gleaming with bloodlust.\n\nMy training as Aldric kicks in, though my new body hinders me with every move. My legs, though encased in impractical boots, prove to be my greatest asset. A desperate high kick sends the closest Skrall reeling back, its jaw snapping shut with a sickening crunch.\n\nBut there's little time to celebrate. The second creature seizes its chance, its bone blade slicing a fiery line across my thigh, biting painfully through the scant protection of my armor. I cry out, not in pain but frustration, feeling warm blood trickling down my leg.\n\nI'm cornered now, the cold stone wall pressing against my back, the air thick with the stench of my fear and their malice. The lead Skrall, wounded but enraged, charges at me, its weapon raised for a killing blow.\n\nAt the last second, I duck. Reaching deep within, I tap into the primal survival instinct that no transformation can strip away. Whisperwind arcs through the air with a grace I forgot I possessed, severing the creature's head from its neck. Blood spatters across the dungeon floor, dark and gleaming in the torchlight. The head rolls to a stop at Snib's feet, its expression forever frozen in a snarl.\n\nThe remaining Skralls, discouraged by the fall of their companions, retreat into the shadows. I pant, clutching my sword tightly.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Snib murmurs from behind me, his grasp loosening on my leash, \"You're not entirely useless, titsy.\"\n\nThey were tiny ones. I’ve fought bigger Skralls. Much bigger. And I’m not sure I could handle much more than I just did.\n\nTheir retreat leaves us in silence, but the respite is fleeting. We proceed further into the bowels of the K'Tarran crypt. Its ancient walls moan under the strain of time, echoing with the lingering whispers of the past.\n\nSuddenly, the path drops away into a gaping maw, a pit filled with what appears to be loose soil, but my warrior’s instincts recognize it instantly. Quicksand.\n\n\"Go on, cowtits,\" Snib sneers, tugging my leash towards the pit. A precarious stone path stretches across the pit, a tightrope walker's dream. But with my awkward high-heeled boots and disproportionately heavy body, it's a nightmare.\n\n[Choice: Attempt to cross...",

Panicked, I lurch for the next step, but my heel slips, throwing me off balance. I flail. And then, I'm falling.\n\nThe quicksand swallows me greedily, each frantic movement pulling me deeper. Its gritty texture clings to my skin, coating my voluptuous body. My breasts and ass, those twin burdens, sink faster, dragging me down.

But then, solidifying his resolution, he turns away. “Have it yer way then, Elise. Stupid girl,” he spits the words out like venom. Standing there, arms akimbo, he watches, likely expecting my resolve to crumble.\n\nThe sand rises to my chest, each breath I take becoming a laborious, terrifying effort. My heart pounds against my ribcage, throbbing in my ears louder than any war drum. Fear claws at my mind, tearing through the fabric of my willpower. The suffocating embrace of the quicksand challenges every moment I choose to defy him.\n\n“Snib, please!” The words slip out, a stark contrast to my earlier defiance. My voice is muffled, strained through layers of dense, damp sand.\n\nThe time slips by, every passing second a grain of sand sealing my fate.\n\n\"Oh, fer the love of—\" Snib finally mutters.\n\nHis hand reaches out, clutching the leash. But as his fingers close around it, a disturbing realization dawns. The sand has risen too high, encasing my chest, my breaths shallow and labored.\n\n\"Snib!\" I choke out.\n\nHe pulls, but it's too late. The force of his tug is but a futile gesture against the merciless sand. \"Damn it, Elise!\" he curses, pulling with more urgency, but the grip of the dungeon’s ancient trap is unyielding.\n\nMy vision blurs, the dungeon’s cold, dimly lit walls fading into a darkening periphery. Snib’s figure looms over me, distorted by the veil of imminent darkness encroaching upon my senses.\n\n\"Should've taken the deal!\" he spits out.\n\nMy heart beats its last frantic tattoo against the constricting sands, and as the darkness swallows me whole, my final thought is a whisper of regret and defiance.\n\nThe dungeon claims another life, its secrets preserved, its thirst unquenched.\n\n(:\"05 quicksand\",5,\"You are dead.\")\"No! I won’t pay you!\" I splutter, spitting out sand. My refusal echoes off the stone walls, ringing with the remains of my dignity.\n\nSnib’s laughter is cruel, a sharp contrast to my plight. \"Yer a tough one, ain't ya? Would rather sink than give in?\" His voice drips with mockery.\n\n\"I would,\" I affirm, the sand creeping up, encasing my heavy breasts, my heart pounding in fierce rebellion. \"I'll not be demeaned further.\"\n\nSnib's satisfaction is sufficient!]His green eyes narrow, studying me with a blend of amusement and irritation. \"Fine, yer no fun today,\" he grumbles, taking a hesitant step back. \"But remember this, Elise, you owe me one!\"\n\nWith a huff, he finally extends the end of the leash towards me. \"Grab it, you stubborn wench,\" he commands, his voice laced with exasperation.\n\nI reach desperately, my fingers curling around the cold metal. The pull is rough, each tug igniting a fire of sand against my skin, abrading my soft, exposed flesh. My breasts and ass shake with the force of his pulls, the sand falling away in heavy clumps.\n\n\"C'mon, out you come,\" Snib mutters under his breath, more to himself than to me. There’s no hiding the irritation in his raspy tone.\n\nFinally, I flop onto solid ground next to him, gasping for air, my body a mess of sand and relief. His gaze is hard, lips twisted in annoyance. \"You're a pain, woman.

The walls are adorned with ancient carvings, depicting horrid monstrous beings that defy description, their forms twisted and grotesque. Relics of an ancient civilization, one with a far different understanding of the world than our own. And far crueler, as well.\n\nThe historical value of these carvings is immense - archaeologists from Thuulk would pay dearly to know of them. The adventurer inside me flickers; I yearn to take a closer look, to decipher the stories etched into the walls. But Snib is quick to shatter my moment of awe. \"Come on, slut,” he grunts, tugging harshly at my leash. \"We ain't here for a history lesson.\"\n\nHis narrow-mindedness grates on my nerves, but I swallow down my frustration. With a last, longing look at the carvings, I follow Snib deeper into the crypt.\n\nEvery step forward feels like a sin, an invasion of this ancient sanctum. Sand crunches under my boots, the rough granules scraping against my skin. I rub at the sand stuck between my thick thighs, trying to clean myself as best as I can while we march onward.\n\nThe cavern narrows once again into a winding pathway, the carvings on the wall now dim, fading shadows of a past long forgotten. As if on cue, a distant skittering noise echoes through the crypt, bouncing off the stone walls.\n\nOut of the darkness, monstrous forms slink into the faint, torchlight. These are not the small, gangly scavengers from before. These Skralls stand taller, their bodies bulkier, eyes gleaming with a cruel, menacing intelligence. There's a predatory hunger in their gaze, their focus solely on us, on our intrusion.\n\n\"We've got company,\" I murmur, pulling Whisperwind free from its scabbard.

My high-heeled boots sink into the sand, each movement precarious, a potential disaster.\n\nIn a flash, I counter, Whisperwind flashing like liquid silver. I thrust forward, aiming for the Skrall's throat. But my advance is hampered by my cumbersome, jiggling breasts. They smack against my bare arms. I wince, my attack falling short.\n\nEven as I struggle to regain my footing, another Skrall lunges towards me. A quick step back, another desperate parry. A riposte.\n\nIt's as if my body is fighting against me. The scanty bikini strains against my huge tits with every movement, my fat ass-cheeks constantly jiggling, a lewd spectacle for all to see.\n\nOne Skrall swings its bone club at me. In a desperate attempt, I feign a lunge to the left, my wide hips swinging, my body jolting forward. The Skrall falls for it, shifting its attention. It gives me the split-second I need to swing Whisperwind, the blade singing as it slices through the air. My enemy gurgles and falls away.\n\nThe Skralls keep coming, relentless in their assault.\n\nA handful of sand finds its way into my grasp. With a swift movement, I fling it at a Skrall's face, momentarily blinding it. I take advantage, driving my sword through its chest. It lets out a screech, another body falling limp onto the sandy floor.\n\nMy triumph is short-lived. They close in from all sides, their monstrous forms a grotesque dance in the dim torchlight. My breaths come out in sharp, ragged gasps, the weight of my new body slowly taking its toll on my energy levels. I’m desperate, my mind racing, trying to find a way out.\n\n\"Master!\" I cry out, the word a bitter taste on my tongue. “Please!

The strain is agonizing, my scant bikini digging deeper into my flesh, my ass jiggling wildly, my breasts straining against the fabric. I bring the blade down in a powerful diagonal cleave, cutting down two Skralls at once.\n\nBut even as they fall, others take their place. I'm overwhelmed, my body weakening, each parry, each riposte a monumental effort. Despair seeps into my bones, their leering faces growing larger, their cruel laughter filling the cavern.\n\n\"Master, please!\" I plead once again, my voice echoing in the crypt. “We are BOTH going to die!”\n\nThe situation deteriorates rapidly.\n\nI retaliate with a quick thrust, Whisperwind finding its mark, but another Skrall lunges, its bony weapon narrowly missing my face. I feel my unruly hair whipping around, obscuring my vision.\n\nMy heart pounds against my constricted chest, each breath a painful gasp. I attempt a risky maneuver, turning on my high-heeled boots, my ass clapping loudly, my sword slashing through the air. Two Skralls show slash-marks, but the victory is pyrrhic.

A torrent of relief floods my body, tingling energy igniting every nerve ending. It feels like awakening from a long, torturous sleep, a sudden realization of power held captive. I feel my magic unshackling, the neutered force within me springing back to life, pulsating and raring to be unleashed. It is the strength of Aldric, the power I once held command over, now rushing back to me in an overwhelming wave.\n\nWith a roar that shakes the crypt, I throw my head back, the energy building within me focusing into a potent force. \"Ignisurge!\" I cry, the incantation reverberating off the stone walls.\n\nThe world seems to hold its breath. Then, with a cry of release, I unleash a blinding bolt of searing magic, the explosive energy pouring forth from my outstretched hand. It sails through the air, its path a streak of blazing light, before crashing into the nearest Skrall. The creature screams, its form engulfed in flames.\n\nAgain and again, I cast Searing Bolt, the magic flowing through me, its raw power intoxicating. Each Skrall that falls under my onslaught is a catharsis, a release of pent-up frustration and fear. Each blast is a proclamation of my will to survive, to reclaim my strength despite my humiliating transformation. It is the rage of Aldric, the resilience of Elise, the defiance of a warrior trapped in a lewd spectacle.\n\nSnib's eyes widen, witnessing the deadly magic that I wield. His grip loosens on my leash, surprise etching across his features. Perhaps he underestimated the strength that lay dormant within me. Perhaps he underestimated the lengths to which I would go to survive.\n\nOne by one, they fall, until the crypt is silent, save for the crackling flames and my ragged breathing.\n\nWith the last of the Skralls defeated, I finally lower my arm, the expended magic leaving me exhausted but victorious. The relief is palpable, my body trembling with the aftershocks of the intense fight. But amidst the exhaustion, there's a glimmer of hope, a spark of resolve that refuses to be extinguished. I am Elise, but within me, Aldric still fights, still persists. And with each battle, each hardship, I will reclaim my strength, one step at a time.\n\nBreathing heavily, I collapse onto the cold, unforgiving stone floor, my body exhausted from the battle, the echoes of my magic still tingling in my fingertips. My breasts heave with each gasp, my chest tight in the constricting bikini. The weight of victory is bittersweet, tinged with the taste of my humiliation and fear.\n\n\"Snib,\" I rasp out, struggling to lift myself up from the ground. \"I need... my magic... going forward.\"\n\nThe goblin's chuckle echoes in the silence of the crypt. \"Admitting weakness already, cowtits?\" His voice drips with mockery, his amusement clear in his gleaming eyes.\n\nAnger sparks within me. \"I am not weak. This body... it's not mine. I need time to... to adjust. Without my magic, I'll be...\"\n\nHis grip tightens on my leash, jerking me forward. The metal collar digs into my neck, cutting off my words. I gasp, my body lurching, my breasts jiggling with the sudden movement. Fear spikes within me as I claw at the collar, desperation seeping into my eyes.\n\n\"Let's get one thing straight, ye pathetic cunt,” Snib growls, leaning close, his eyes glinting menacingly. \"Yer not in charge here. Yer my pet. My toy. If you need magic to play, you’ll prove yourself loyal to me first.\"",

      "text": "The air grows colder, the stench of decay and mustiness growing stronger. Through the murky darkness, a hulking figure lumbers into view, its grotesque form illuminated by the flickering torchlight.\n\nThe Skrall King.\n\nHe towers over us, a monstrous aberration of the Skralls. Thick, gnarled muscles ripple under his rough hide, his hunched back pulsating with a vile, sickly green light. In his hand, he wields a jagged bone club, the edges gleaming ominously. He bellows a deafening roar, sending shivers of fear through me.\n\nI grip Whisperwind tighter, the blade feeling alien in my petite hands. My heart pounds against my constricted chest as the Skrall King charges. Each thundering footfall shakes the ground beneath us, a herald of the oncoming assault.\n\nTwisting my body, I manage to barely evade the first blow, my breasts swinging heavily with the movement, the momentum throwing me off balance. With great effort, I regain my footing, my eyes trained on the towering beast.\n\n\"Ventusfury!\" I shout, thrusting my free hand forward. A surge of wind magic roars forth, spiraling towards the Skrall King. It slams into him, tossing him back a few steps. But the creature roars, charging through the gusts towards me.\n\nSweat trickles down my face, dripping onto the cold stone beneath my boots. My magic drains with each spell, the energy ebbing away. I can feel my strength waning, my body growing sluggish, the exhaustion setting in. But I push through, calling upon the last of my reserves.\n\nI dart around the Skrall King, landing quick jabs and slashes wherever I can. My wide hips sway with each movement, my plump buttocks clapping with the frantic rhythm of my dance with death. The scant metal bikini bottom scrapes against my sensitive skin, the discomfort merely another challenge to overcome.\n\nA lucky break presents itself. I leap forward, plunging Whisperwind into the beast's chest. The Skrall King bellows, stumbling back. But he doesn't fall, his glaring eyes full of rage. I withdraw the blade, stepping back as the beast lashes out in a blind rage.\n\nI have no magic left, only my sword and my will to survive. I can feel my breasts heaving against the tight metal bikini, the cool steel chafing my sensitive nipples. My limbs tremble, my body screaming for respite, but I ignore it. With a primal roar, I charge at the Skrall King, a final push against the monstrosity.\n\nIt's a struggle, a brutal dance of survival. Every swing of my blade, every dodge, every parry is fueled by desperation. My mind is singularly focused, blocking out the distracting jiggle of my oversized breasts, the scrape of the bikini against my skin, the mocking whispers of the goblin behind me.\n\nWith a final, gut-wrenching scream, I plunge Whisperwind deep into the Skrall King's chest. The beast roars, lashing out with one last futile swipe. His monstrous form shudders, his eyes rolling back, before collapsing onto the cold, stone floor.\n\nI stand there, panting heavily, my body trembling from the strain. I feel a wave of exhaustion wash over me, threatening to pull me down. But I fight it, my grip on Whisperwind never wavering. I have won. Despite the odds, despite the humiliating transformation, despite my loss of magic... I have won.\n\nBut the victory is hollow, a testament to my perseverance rather than my power. I am Elise, but within me, Aldric still fights.\n\n[Choice: Loot the Skrall King's lair!",

      "text": "As I stagger around the chamber, panting from exhaustion,I spot a small chest in the corner, barely visible under a pile of broken bones and shredded armor. I reach out, struggling to lift it with my weak arms.\n\nWith some effort, I manage to pry open the chest. The glimmer of gold coins shines brightly amidst the surrounding gore and grime. I count them quickly - a hundred gold pieces, a fraction of the ten thousand I need to pay Snib and break the curse. A pit forms in my stomach as the enormity of the task ahead truly hits me. But there's something else in the chest too. A worn, dusty book.\n\nI pick it up, opening it carefully. Its pages are filled with a flowing, delicate script, recounting tales of a long-forgotten age. As I skim through the pages, I sense that it speaks of the lost K'Tarran ancients, the original denizens of this land. There are sketches of strange artifacts, maps of hidden cities, and cryptic notes on powerful magic. My heart skips a beat. This could be important, a key to understanding the mystery of the K'Tarran ancients.\n\nBut just as I'm about to dive into the journal's intriguing contents, a loud, grating laugh fills the chamber. I look up, my heart sinking as Snib hobbles over to me, his hideous, warty face split in a nasty grin. His massive, veiny schlong swings between his legs, half-engorged below his loincloth, drooling viscous pre-cum.\n\n\"What's that?\" He asks, pointing at the journal with his pudgy finger. I try to explain, but he dismisses me, his attention riveted on the glistening gold coins. As he reaches for them, his monstrous member slaps onto the journal, splattering it with his potent pre-cum.\n\nThe filthy liquid soaks the delicate parchment. It dribbles down the handwritten notes, smearing the ink and causing the pages to crumble. The musky scent of his virility is overpowering, permeating the room and making my head spin. It's repugnant, suffocating, and the smell alone is enough to make my pussy respond involuntarily, lubricating itself in shameful reaction to his dominance.\n\n\"No! Sn-\" The collar tightens abruptly, choking off my words. I cough, struggling to get out the word \"Master\". I watch helplessly as he intentionally ruins the journal, his phallus still slowly oozing pre-cum onto it. The stench of it is so thick, so cloying, it clings to everything it touches, impossible to wash off.\n\nAs he carelessly flicks the ruined journal aside, his cock thwapping against his green thigh with a sloppy wet sound, he smirks at me. His lust-filled eyes roam over my jiggly tits and wide hips, encased in the uncomfortable metallic bikini. His grin widens at the thought of my performance later tonight, my humiliating dance back at his hut.\n\nAs I watch him scoop up the gold, a sense of despair washes over me. The lost knowledge of the K'Tarran ancients, the mystery of the ancient magic, is now forever out of my grasp, ruined by the thoughtless actions of this vile creature. His repulsive virility has not only claimed my body but also this sliver of hope I had found.\n\nAnd I am left with nothing but the daunting task of finding the remaining 9,900 gold coins to pay him, all while fighting off his sadistic glee and my own involuntary, humiliating reactions to his dominance.\n\n[Choice: Back in Snib's hut...",

The intense sensation of my own bare skin, the coolness of the evening air raising goosebumps on my flesh, feels foreign and uncomfortable. The only thing I’m allowed to wear, is the heavy slave collar clamped around my neck.\n\nHis goblin eyes glint as he reclines on his pile of furs, stroking his 12-inch cock slowly, leisurely, as if he has all the time in the world to savor the spectacle of the evening’s entertainment.\n\nMercifully, I won’t have to touch him tonight. I’m just required to put on a show.\n\nDoesn't make it any less revolting.\n\nI've seen the tavern girls perform before, their bodies swaying to the rhythm of the music.

Something that might help me find a sort of rhythm.\n\n*In the heart of Eboncrest, 'neath a weeping willow tree,\nSat a Silver Lark, as fair as fair can be.\nWith feathers kissed by moonlight, and a voice so sweet and clear,\nShe'd make the grizzliest warlord shed a solitary tear*\n\n“Dance, cowtits!” Snib commands, stroking his engorged, pre-drooling member as he sprawls out on his filthy bed. “Gimme somethin good.

It's thick, pulsing, and leaking pre-cum as he pumps leisurely, his disgusting gaze fixated on me.\n\nI raise my hands, attempting to shield my heavy, swinging tits from his view. My fingers slightly part above my nipples, the flesh bulging around my palms because even my hands aren’t big enough to cover them completely. I hate how my nipples throb, painfully stiff at the exposure and the chill in the air.\n\nI start by rolling my hips. The movement feels strange as I try to channel some of the sensual moves I've seen from tavern dancers, but the sensation of my wide ass cheeks clapping against each other with a lewd smack makes me cringe inwardly. My nipples, frustratingly hard despite—or maybe because of—my embarrassment, push against the palms of my hands. Every slight shift sends a tremor through them, each jolt a sharp spike of unwanted pleasure.\n\n\"Come on, don't be shy with those cow udders, Elise! I'm tryna get off here!\" Snib heckles from his reclined position, his ugly face twisted in a grotesque smirk. His fingers are wrapped around his engorged, green cock, stroking vigorously. The sight is revolting, his cock's veiny girth coated with a sheen of thick, slimy pre-cum, drooling down onto his hairy groin.\n\nReluctantly, I force myself to swing my hips more assertively, trying to ignore the hot flush creeping up my cheeks. The cool air hits my damp pussy, reminding me shamefully of my body's treacherous arousal. My movements are clumsy, my thighs thick and curvaceous, thighs rubbing against each other with each side-to-side motion, creating a soft *schluuup* noise that fills the humid room.\n\n*Oh, Silver Lark of Eboncrest, sing your song for me,\nGuide me through the shadowed vale, across the Azure Sea.\nThrough the hills of Ambergold, where the Crystal Rivers flow,\nTo the Sands of Sapphirine, where the Silver Nightflowers grow.*\n\nMy hands flutter briefly from my tits in an attempt to put more flair into the dance. Instantly, Snib's eyes light up with perverse glee, and I hate myself for giving him even a moment's satisfaction. \"That's it, shake those money-makers, you stupid slut!\"\n\nHorrified with myself, I quickly cover them again, but not before those grotesque mounds bounce obscenely, a visual feast for the depraved goblin. I writhe, heart pounding, my oversized breasts moving rhythmically against my palms, the sensitive flesh spilling over the sides of my overtaxed hands.\n\nThe sensation is awful, unnatural. Each twirl and sway makes my body wobble—tits, hips, ass—the exaggerated femininity of my cursed form betraying my every motion. My nipples scrape against my palms, sending sparks of unwanted pleasure shooting through my body.\n\n\"Stop covering them! Goddammit, I wanna see those big, bouncy jugs you got!\" Snib barks, his voice thick with lust as he grips his cock harder, pumping with a wild fervor.\n\nIn a moment of deranged compliance—or maybe desperate defiance—I let my hands drop to my sides, revealing my enormous, heaving breasts in full. The cool air puckers my thick, pink nipples even as they betray my arousal, standing erect and obscenely visible.\n\nThis naked, sultry dance is so far from the noble combat rhythms I used to know. Even fighting Skralls in the crypt was about power, about survival. Now, reduced to this erotic display, it feels like everything powerful about me has been stripped away, leaving nothing but this soft, curvy body made for Snib's sick pleasure.]Gingerly uncrossing my arms, I expose my massive, jiggling breasts to Snib's lecherous gaze. I take an awkward step forward, my hips wobbling from side to side. I've never had to move like this before, with the intent to provide a show. But now, I'm Elise, cursed to please this vile creature.\n\n*Oh, Silver Lark of Eboncrest, sing your song for me,\nGuide me through the shadowed vale, across the Azure Sea.\nThrough the hills of Ambergold, where the Crystal Rivers flow,\nTo the Sands of Sapphirine, where the Silver Nightflowers grow.*\n\nI take a few more steps, my hips swinging awkwardly, attempting to imitate a specific type of dance I’d seen at the tavern, set to one of my favorite childhood songs. I can feel the muscles in my lower back and hips working in ways they never had before, the exertion causing beads of sweat to roll down the curve of my back and between my ass cheeks.\n\nNow I sway my upper body, a rhythmic movement that makes my breasts jiggle and bounce in a way that feels so alien. This is not a bounce that comes as a result of some attempted combat move - this is a bounce I caused. I wanted to make happen. My long, black hair swings around me, the ends brushing against my nipples. I stumble slightly when I try to incorporate a hip roll, the unfamiliar movement throwing off my balance. I catch myself before I can fall, my ears burning as Snib chuckles.\n\nHe just continues jacking himself off lazily. I’m stuck between the two opposite evils - dancing too well, and not well enough. Both prospects are quite unappealing. I wince as I audibly hear another spatter of goblin precum hit the floor. I need to lose myself back in the song.\n\n*The Silver Lark, she fluttered, on a sultry summer night,\nHer melody so enticing, her sparkling eyes so bright.\nWith each enchanting trill and coo, she set all hearts ablaze,\nAnd in the whispers of the wind, you could hear her lilting praise*\n\n[Choice: Try hip rolls...",

Snib's cackles echo through the hut, making my skin crawl. His pungent pre-cum fills the air, its scent nauseatingly potent. I fight the urge to vomit, the smell mixing with the sweat and dust in the room.\n\n\"Show me your ass!\" Snib demands. Blushing fiercely, I turn, revealing my bare backside to him. Doing so purposefully, feels so obscene and wrong. I try to mimic the bouncing I've seen the tavern girls do, the shaking causing my round, firm buttocks to jiggle. The sensation is unfamiliar, and I'm hyper-aware of the cold air against my exposed pussy, causing me to clench involuntarily.\n\nSnib's laughter fills the room, the mocking sound echoing in my ears as I continue my dance. His disgusting words, his blatant ogling, and his obscene sounds fill the room, mixing with the squelching of his monstrous member.\n\nAs I dance, I try to block out Snib's voice, focusing instead on the strange sensation of my body moving in such an intimate, sensual way. The burning in my muscles, the foreign sway of my breasts, the way my hips roll - it's all so strange, so new. But I continue, driven by the need to please Snib and hopefully reduce my debt.\n\nThe dance seems to last forever, the minutes dragging into what feels like hours. I can't look at Snib, can't bear to see the lewd enjoyment on his face as he continues to stroke himself, his pre-cum leaking onto the dirt floor of the hut.\n\nI stumble again as I attempt to bounce my ass, one cheek at a time.

Its cold, metallic embrace constricts my throat, interrupting the decadent dance of my fingers. My hand jerks away as if scalded, a jolt of unreleased tension lurching through me. I'm left gasping, robbed of the precious release that had been so tantalizingly within reach.\n\nFor a moment, I allow myself the luxury of pure, unadulterated indignation. But the hard, restricting pressure of the collar serves as a stark reminder of my captive state. I'm forced to curl my trembling fingers into a fist, the slickness of my own arousal cooling on my skin as the wave of need crashes against the harsh barrier of Snib's command.\n\nThe air seems to thicken, congealing into a swamp of frustration and indignity. The taste of unfulfilled desire is bitter on my tongue as I curl up on the straw mat, my body coiled tight with pent-up energy. Every muscle is tense, every nerve alight with thwarted passion. A shudder racks my voluptuous body, the cool night air pricking my hypersensitive skin.\n\nThe curve of my generous breasts heaves with each ragged breath, my flushed cheeks burning in the dim light. My plump ass presses into the rough straw beneath me as I twist onto my side, the sensation a hollow mockery of the pleasure I had been denied. My legs coil tighter, thighs pressing together in a vain attempt to alleviate the throbbing ache between them. But there is no escape from the relentless pulse of my arousal.\n\nMy heart pounds a furious rhythm against my ribcage, the echo of my thwarted climax pounding in my ears. I squeeze my eyes shut, the darkness behind my eyelids swarming with lewd images of my own debauchery. My lush lips part in a silent moan, a plea for a release that's denied to me.\n\nThe night stretches on, each second an eternity of longing and resentment. Each rustle of straw, each gust of wind seems to mock my predicament, the torment of my unfulfilled desire a cruel serenade. The hot sting of tears prick at the corners of my eyes, my breath hitching as I try to stifle the sobs. My body writhes, twists, shifts restlessly on the straw bed, the ceaseless ache of my arousal a constant, torturous companion.\n\nEventually, the tears dry up, the sobs fading into ragged, weary breaths. The tension in my body slowly unravels, leaving a dull ache in its wake. Sleep, when it finally comes, is fitful and restless, my dreams haunted by images of unfulfilled desire and cruel dominance. Even in the sanctuary of slumber, there is no escape from the torment of my captive existence.\n\n*Now, the Silver Lark lies captive, in a cage of cruel decree,\nHer wings are clipped, song stifled, she’s longing to be free.\nO whither wilt thou flutter, O Lark of Eboncrest?\nNo songbird tied so cruelly, can ever love her nest*\n\n[Choice: The next day...",

      "text": "--- Chapter 6: The Visit ---\nIn the chill of the early desert morning, I shuffle around Snib's primitive hut, getting breakfast ready as my sleepy goblin overlord had commanded.\n\nDespite the primitive conditions, I manage to prepare a modest breakfast with the desert berries and cactus fruit I’d foraged yesterday. The juice from the fruit sizzles and pops in the rickety pan, filling the hut with a sweet, tangy aroma that somehow doesn't feel out of place amidst the permanent stench of Snib's musk.\n\nI really hope I’m not getting used to this.\n\n\"Oi, cowtits, hurry it up,\" Snib grunts from his makeshift bed, smacking his lips in anticipation. His coarse accent grates against my eardrums. \"M' stomach ain't gonna fill itself.\"\n\n\"Yes, *Master,*\" I use the honorific mechanically, holding back a grimace. The damned collar around my neck doesn't *do* anything, but the threat of constriction makes me default to using the word.\n\nIt's humiliating, but obedience for the moment is better than constantly getting disciplined.\n\nI serve him his breakfast, a makeshift concoction of mashed cactus fruit and stewed desert berries. The way Snib's beady eyes follow every movement of my tits as I place the dish before him, makes my skin crawl.\n\nBut as he shovels down the food with voracious abandon, I can't help but feel a twinge of satisfaction. Despite the meager ingredients, the dish isn't half bad. I suppose there's something to be said for having to make do with what you have.\n\nAfter he's finished, Snib wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, a disturbingly satisfied expression on his warty face.\n\n“Nice job, cow,” he says, his words half muffled by a belch.\n\nNow that breakfast is over, he looks at me with a gleam in his eyes that sets off alarm bells in my head.\n\n“Slut,” he begins, his voice a disturbing coo, \"I've got a proposition for ya. You've been a good little bitch so far, yeah? Well, I got something tha' might just sweeten your chains a bit.\"\n\n[Choice: What kind of proposition?",

      "text": "\"Yer getting all squirmy, aren't ya? Can smell ya from 'ere,\" he sneers, nostrils flaring.\n\nThe reality of his words hit me like a slap to the face. I blush, and try not to react further while he continues...\n\n\"What if I let ya visit yer dear little wifey, Elara, if ya start giving me a little pleasure each day?\" He grins at my stunned silence, one of his hands dropping to his bulging loincloth, his intentions dreadfully clear. “A little deal 'tween me and my slave.”\n\n“I-” my voice is shaky at that thought of seeing my wife. “If you’re there, master, it’s so hard for me…” Visiting her two days ago was hell. Snib was there, groping my ass while my wife watched.\n\n“No,” the goblin says. “I mean ta say, you and your wifey get some precious *alone* time. One whole day. Yer collar stays on, o’ course…”\n\nPressing his gnarly fingers together, Snib smirks, a grotesque display of anticipation lighting up his loathsome features.\n\n“But 'ere’s the nasty hitch,” his thin lips curl into a grotesque smile. “I needs ma *daily ball drainage*, and *you're gonna be the pump*, bitch. Just yer hands, don't worry.”\n\nHe chortles like it's an everyday conversation, like we're discussing the weather.\n\n\"Do that, and I'll give ya an entire day alone with your wifey. No interruptions,\" he adds, the words oozing like poison honey from his lecherous mouth. “Just you and that sweet cunt of hers, talkin’ away. Nothin’ off the table for you two…”\n\nThe idea of touching him in any form is repulsive, but a day with Elara... it's a torturous temptation.\n\n\"A whole day - morning to n- night?\" I manage to choke out, my voice barely above a whisper as I struggle to keep my composure. My gaze drifts downwards, fixating on the horrifying sight of his engorged cock straining against the filthy fabric of his loincloth.\n\n\"Yeah, a whole fucking day to sniff and lick yer woman, all without my handsome goblin dick to spoil the view,\" he mocks, his gaze burning into me with disgusting intensity. \"But first, you gotta milk this fat goblin cock, make it spurt good. Use those delicate slut hands of yours to work my meat. And remember, cow tits,\" he pauses for effect, “the better you milk me, the sooner you’ll get to cuddle up with your precious Elara.”\n\nTears sting my eyes, a mix of fury and desperation clouding my vision. The thought of touching him is unbearable, yet the yearning to be with Elara, to explain everything, to hold her, overwhelms all reason.\n\nMy nipples harden as I remember the Silver Stag bathroom, my belly tightens, and the wetness... the incessant wetness becomes a flood. My metal panties are slick, sticking to my swollen folds. I’ve become such a quivering, disgraceful creature.\n\nThat offer is too good to pass up...[Choice: Fine!",

Work for yer wife’s touch,” Snib hisses, a perverse excitement flickering in his beady eyes.\n\nI take in a shallow breath, watching as Snib's cock pulses in the dull light, drooling obscene amounts of precum that stain the wooden floor beneath him.\n\nThere are no tissues here, no means to shield myself from the vile touch of his dick. My heart pounds like a war drum in my chest, my fingers twitching nervously. Yet, there's a perverse sense of anticipation curling in the pit of my stomach. Fear? Arousal? Both are terrifying in their own right.\n\nReluctantly, my trembling hands reach toward it—the heat emanating from his genitals is nauseating, like the breath of some fetid swamp. The moment my fingers brush against the leathery girth of his cock, it pulsates violently, beginning to unfurl with sickening squelches emanating from its base.\n\n\"Gods...\" I whimper, the pulsing heat of him searing into my palms. Through the slick, smegma-coated skin, I can feel his blood thrumming beneath the surface, feeding the hardness. His cock is so thick, so incredibly full, that it feels like I'm holding onto some living weapon, crafted for the sole purpose of domination and breeding.\n\nThe skin is warm, almost burning against my palms, and with each tentative stroke, it grows increasingly rigid.\n\n“I can feel yer pussy dripping from 'ere, titcow,” Snib sneers cruelly. “Yer body knows what it wants, even if yer mind is too fuckin' prissy to admit it.”\n\nI feel a hot rush of shame flood through me as a tight warmth builds between my thighs. My metal panties are shamefully slick, the wetness gathering and drizzling onto the dirt floor beneath me. The humiliation is unbearable, yet the aching heat spreading through my core can’t be denied.\n\nAs I pump his thick, pulsing cock, my hands struggle to meet around the hideous girth. For a dreadful moment, I go cross-eyed as Snib’s engorged member thrusts slightly into my grasp.\n\nEvery pulse, every twitch sends another spurt of precum from the engorged, purple head, droplets splattering onto the floor.\n\nI'm hit with a wave of nausea, but I swallow it down, choking back a sob as I force myself to continue.\n\n“Faster, whore,” he barks, a vile grin splitting his face as he watches me struggle. “Show me how much you want that day with yer wife.”\n\nI can feel every vein, every throbbing pulse under my touch. His precum, thick and viscous, coats my hands, making my strokes smoother, easier, a slippery dance of shame and debasement. His cock twitches under my touch, spitting more of its milky fluid out, which I’m careful to avoid.\n\nI look around the room, thinking about his cum. Where is it going to go?\n\n\"Bet you're loving this, ain't you?\" Snib goads, his words punctuated by a low, rumbling chuckle. His hips thrust up, seeking more of my touch. \"Maybe I'll have you drain my balls twice a day, yeah?\"\n\nThe mere thought sends a shudder of revulsion through me. But there's a spark there, an undeniable arousal that adds to my shame. I can't help but imagine it, how I'd become his personal plaything, my body dedicated to pleasuring his lewd desires.\n\n\"Imagine if yer wife could see you now,\" Snib says, a gleeful grin pulling at his lips. \"Bet she'd piss herself laughing, seeing her husband as a cock-milking wench.\"\n\nNo, she would just be heart-broken. My face burns, the heat matching the one that seems to spread from my hand to my core. Yet, my hands keep moving, drawn to the primal heat, the pulsing hardness.\n\nMy collar feels heavier, chafing against my throat. My breaths come out in shaky gasps, my own body jjiggling in the restrictive metal bikini with each stroke. Snib's moans grow louder, his cock throbbing harder, his body tense with anticipation.\n\n“All the way to the base, cow tits,\" Snib orders, his voice a deep, throaty growl that rumbles across the small hut. \"That's where all the good stuff is...”\n\nMy hands close around the base of his thick, pulsing member, wrapping themselves around the sheer girth of it. The root of the tree. I can feel every vein, every pulsation, every twitch. It’s a tower of raw impregnating power, intimidating and repulsive. It's hot and damp against my skin, coated in a sticky layer of pre-cum. It leaks from the engorged, purple head in thick, viscous droplets, stringing between my fingers.\n\n\"Like that,\" he grunts, hips bucking slightly. \"Harder.\"\n\n[Choice: Tighten your grip.",

The heat is searing, the disgusting reality of my situation sinking in even further.\n\nI can almost see the squirming sperm within, writhing, begging to be released. Begging to get me pregnant. My heart hammers in my chest.\n\n\"Yea... that's it,” Snib sneers, his beady eyes fixed on my trembling body. \"Pump it. Milk it. You're nothing more than a goblin's slut now.\"\n\nThe words sting. My body, once a weapon, a protector, is now nothing more than an instrument of pleasure for this vile creature. The metallic tang of my own humiliation is a bitter pill to swallow, but I have no choice.\n\n\"Again,\" he orders, his voice laced with sadistic pleasure. \"Always usin’ both hands. I want to feel those pretty little fingers ALL OVER my cock.\"\n\nI comply, my hands moving in tandem to stroke up and down the throbbing shaft. The heat is overwhelming, my palms sliding easily over the slick surface. My thighs squeeze together.\n\n\"Fuck... yehhh,” he rasps, his voice filled with satisfaction. \"Just like that, cumdump. Keep stroking... keep pumping... you're doing a good job. Maybe I'll have you drain my balls twice a day.

I keep stroking, keep pumping, my hands a slave to his commands. His cock twitches and pulsates in my hands, his body reacting to my touch. His grunts and groans fill the hut, drowning out the desperate whimpers that spill from my lips.\n\nMy body responds, a betrayal that stokes the flame of my humiliation. Yet, amidst the shame, I find a perverse sort of satisfaction. For despite everything, I am still here, still breathing, still fighting. I am not broken, and I refuse to be.\n\n\"Keep going,\" he orders, his voice thick with lust. \"Keep pumping…”\n\nThe minutes feel like hours. Snib's breath grows more labored, his chest heaving beneath his leathery, green skin.\n\n\"Gonna... gonna cum, cow tits...\" he rasps out, his voice thick with impending climax. His hips buck, urging me to continue, faster and harder. \"Gonna cover those big, fat tits of yours...\"",

I don’t want to end up like the captive girls who lose their minds due to the powerful phermones.\n\nFrantically, I reach out, my hand finding a large mug on the rickety table nearby. It's crude and chipped, but it's the only thing I can use. With renewed urgency, I position it beneath the throbbing, massive member, ready to catch the explosive release.\n\nThe one-handed strokes become more desperate, my fingers digging into the veiny girth of his cock. His grunts and groans grow louder.\n\nI try to push those thoughts away, focusing on the task at hand. My free hand gently squeezes his heavy balls, trying to placate his complaints. \"Master... please...\" I beg, my voice barely a whisper, \"into the mug...\"\n\nI can feel his massive member twitching and pulsating in my hand, the heat of it nearly unbearable. His grunts turn into low growls, his body tightening as he nears the edge. “Keep... stroking... cow tits...\" he manages to grit out, his eyes narrowing to slits.\n\nThe thought of all that vile seed covering me sends chills down my spine. I shudder at the thought, my mind reeling at the possible outcomes. Would I lose my mind? Would I become a mindless, bimbo cow, forever under the control of this goblin? I'm on the brink of a panic attack, my breaths shallow and quick.\n\nMy hand moves on autopilot, the rhythm of it steady and sure, despite the fear coursing through me. My other hand keeps the mug in place, shaking slightly. The tension in the room is palpable, a thick, heavy blanket that engulfs everything. I can only hope that the mug will contain it all... because if not, I have no idea what might happen.\n\nHis grunts grow louder, more forceful, his hips thrusting into my hand. I can feel the impending release, the head of his cock swelling under my touch. Any moment now... any moment... the climax is close. All I can do is hope... hope that I can contain it... hope that I can avoid the inevitable... hope that I can maintain control.\n\nBut for now, I continue... stroking, pumping, milking... the image of the thick, potent ropes of goblin seed seared into my mind. The fear is all-consuming, a dark, swirling vortex that threatens to consume me. I can only pray that it's enough... that I can withstand it... that I can survive... for now.\n\nAnd then, with a guttural, bestial roar that echoes off the walls of the ramshackle hut, Snib hits his peak. His entire body convulses, his knotted muscles tightening beneath his leathery green skin as his member throbs and pulses in my hand, each twitch like a small earthquake shaking me to my core.\"Take yer top off.\"\n\nWith trembling hands, I reach for the clasps of my metal bikini top. The cold metal bites into my skin as I unclip it, and suddenly the weight of my large, sensitive breasts is released. They fall free with an embarrassing *plap plap*, slapping against each other, dangling into place.\n\nSnib's eyes are wide, his filthy grin stretching across his warty face. He grunts with satisfaction, leering at my exposed chest. \"Ohh, look at those cow tits... perfect for my nasty goblin cum.\"\n\nI hate these big, fat sacks of flesh attached to me, bouncing with every slight movement. They remind me so much of what I've lost – my identity, my dignity, my strength. They're so heavy...\n\nAs Snib grunts and starts pumping his cock again, angling it toward my chest, a dreadful realization sets in.\n\n*This isn't a good idea.* His sperm, thick and vile, is a biohazard, loaded with mind-altering pheromones. Even a drop is enough to make my thoughts hazy, to make me more susceptible, more compliant. The idea of a *full load* coating my skin, the smell... it might never wash off.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" I start, the urgency rising. The thought of his cum on me, changing me even more, sends a sharp pang of panic through me. \"Wait a minute—\"\n\n\"Too fucking late,\" Snib sneers through gritted teeth, the glee in his eyes burning into me. He holds my leash with one hand, ensuring I don't move.\n\nHis monstrous erection throbs more intensely now, veins bulging as if they're about to burst. The head of his cock is darkened, engorged to an unbearable girth, leaking pre-cum that glistens like some horrid nectar in the dim light of the hut.\n\nI can only watch, frozen in humiliation and dread, as his balls tighten and shift, signaling the impending release. His cock twitches violently, a visible pulse traveling along its considerable length.\n\nThe final twitch of his cock, the shifting of his heavy, cum-filled balls—it's all happening in slow motion, a nightmare that I'm powerless to stop.\n\nI feel a cold sweat break out over my entire body.

With a guttural moan from Snib, it launches from him—a hot, chowdery blast of cum that arcs through the air with forceful heat. The impact against the tender skin between my breasts is violent—a heavy, wet *smack* that sends ripples through my chest.\n\n\"Nggh!\" I moan.\n\n\"MMM!!!\" he squeals.\n\nThe consistency is revolting—clumpy, custardy, with streaks of yellow. It's visually nauseating, and the smell hits me like a punch—overwhelmingly musky, with a sickly sweet, bleachy odor that suffocates. I can’t help it; my eyes roll back as the overpowering scent floods my senses, clouding my mind.\n\nAs he continues to nut and nut all over my tits, more blasts follow, each a filthy rope of seed that hits with relentless force, painting my chest in a disgusting collage of yellowed semen. Some ropes are thick, landing with a heavy thud against my skin before slowly sludging down, while others are more fluid, running in perverse rivulets between the valley of my breasts.\n\n“Dumb slut, covered in goblin cum,” Snib growls out, his voice dark and satisfied.\n\nThe consistency is revolting—thick and custardy in parts, but horrifyingly runnier in others, creating a yellowed, chunky river that pools and drips down my torso. The scent hits me next, an overwhelming bleachy musk that clouds my senses, making my eyes roll back in a dizzy haze.\n\n“FUCK, yes!” Snib roars, as another vile rope of his goblin seed blurs out, smashing against my chest with sickening force. The thick splatter creates a nasty coat over my breasts, piling upon itself, oozing down my skin in a despicable cascade. Each blast is a shock, a visceral violation that I can *feel* seeping into my skin, carrying its disgusting impulses deep into my mind.\n\nThe overpowering scent, the steamy heat of his discharge, it's all too much.\n\nMy knees weaken, my inner muscles clench uncontrollably. A loud, depraved moan escapes my lips as I can't hold back anymore. My pussy *erupts*, squirting forcefully, my juices spilling out and mixing with the pooling cum on the wooden floor beneath me. \"N-no... not like this—ahhh~!\" I cry out, my voice breaking.\n\nSnib laughs, a terrible sound that rings with cruel satisfaction. “That’s it, cum for me, you dumb bitch. Let it all out.”\n\nHis hateful words cement the dreadful reality—I am here, being defiled, my consciousness ebbing away under the relentless assault of his toxic seed. Another pulse of his cock delivers yet another horrendous load, coating me thoroughly, a yellowed custard of degradation slapping my skin with feverish heat.\n\n\"Ungghhh…” I moan out loud.\n\nThe blast thumps against my heart, radiating a perverse warmth throughout my body. I *feel* his sperm, almost sentient in their vile purpose, attempting to infiltrate, to dominate, to *change* me from the inside out. My mind becomes hazy, thoughts jumbled and slow, each heartbeat interleaved with the throbbing echo of his foul ejaculation.\n\nThe cum piles up, thick and sticky, forming a revolting layer over my breasts that throbs with each beat of my heart. I feel it, the vile warmth of it seeping into me, the sperm wriggling desperately as if seeking to burrow into my flesh, to change me, to breed me.\n\nAnd it’s altering me, making me hazy... My thoughts scramble, my resistance melting away as the biological onslaught overwhelms my senses. I feel... different, my mind foggy, every coherent thought dissolving into a mess of need and base desire.\n\n*Oh gods, what have I done?*\n\nSnib's goblin pheromones will affect you more.\n\nMy mind swims in a fog of his potent, hormonal aftershock, each breath I take a further absorption of his vile essence.\n\nThere, kneeling in a messy puddle of my own making, my breasts slick and heavy with goblin cum, I realize the full extent of my error. It dawns on me just how deeply I've sunk, how much of myself I've surrendered for a momentary promise of reconciliation with Elara.\n\n[Choice: Try to clean up...]And then, with a guttural, bestial roar that echoes off the walls of the ramshackle hut, Snib hits his peak. His entire body convulses, his knotted muscles tightening beneath his leathery green skin as his member throbs and pulses in my hand, each twitch like a small earthquake shaking me to my core.\n\nThe first jet of cum is forceful, blasting out with such raw, unbridled power that it nearly sends the mug flying from my hand. Thick, hot, and heavy, it lands with an obscene squelch, a heavy glop that makes the mug shudder in my hand.\n\nIt's a sickly off-white color, almost glowing in the dim light of the hut.\n\nThe smell hits me next, a nauseating aroma that makes my stomach churn. It fills the air, overpowering and heady, leaving me dizzy and disoriented. It's a scent that speaks of primal, raw sexuality, of a creature that thrives on its own hedonism. I gag, my throat closing up, my body fighting to expel the toxic fumes.\n\nEach subsequent spurt is as powerful as the first, a forceful jet of goblin seed that splatters heavily into the mug. I can see it pooling at the bottom, a viscous, writhing mess that's quickly filling the crude container. It's hot, almost scaldingly so, the heat radiating off it and making my hand damp with sweat.\n\nThe sound is the worst part. Each spurt, each glob of cum that lands in the mug is accompanied by a wet, sticky squelch. It's a depraved, obscene symphony of sexual gratification that echoes through the hut, impossibly loud in the stifling silence. I can feel my face heat with humiliation, the sounds reminding me of my debasement, my servitude.\n\nAs I keep pumping, milking him for all he's worth, his balls twitch in my other hand. I can feel the potent seed moving through him, each contraction pushing another jet of hot cum into the mug. It's a sickening feeling, knowing that I'm helping him release his virile load.\n\nThe mug is quickly filling up, the gooey, viscous goblin seed nearly reaching the top. I'm struggling to hold it upright, the sheer weight of it threatening to send it toppling from my hand. The sight is nauseating, a foaming, frothing mess of goblin cum that writhes and squirms with a life of its own.\n\nSnib is lost in his climax, his eyes rolled back in his head, his body thrashing and jerking with each release. He's a creature possessed, his every thought, his every instinct focused on the potent ejaculation that racks his body. His member continues to throb and pulse in my hand, each twitch a testament to his virility, to his unbridled sexuality that subjugates me.\n\nDespite my best efforts, despite my desperate prayers, the mug overflows. Thick, gooey strands of goblin cum slide down the side, pooling on the floor beneath. The sight is sickening, the heavy ropes of seed forming a messy, sticky pool that reeks of his musk. A chill goes up my spine.\n\nMy hand is smeared in it, the off-white seed sticky and warm against my skin. I can feel it clinging to me. It's a stain that won't easily wash away, a mark that brands me as his possession, as his toy.\n\nThe goblin's climax finally begins to wind down, his grunts and groans diminishing in intensity, his body gradually relaxing. But the evidence of his release remains, a steaming mug of goblin seed that continues to overflow, the heavy ropes of cum forming a small, sticky lake on the floor.\n\nI whimper, turning to rush out the door and dump the mug outside, but the goblin grabs my leash.\n\n“That felt real nice,” Snib rasps, his yellow eyes gleaming in the dim light of the hut as he watches me holding the mug. A lewd grin curls his lips as he leans back, his scaled body glistening with a light sheen of sweat. “Ye plan on drinkin’ that?”",

      "text": "I'm in a fog, a miasma of inexplicable yearning as I grip the heavy mug, its contents writhing and steaming before my bleary eyes. The smell is putrid, overwhelmingly musky, almost like a punch to the senses that drives rational thought away. My hands, though trembling, somehow bring the repugnant concoction closer, the disgusting mass of off-white goblin seed sloshing near the brim.\n\nSnib watches, a malignant grin spreading across his cruel face.\n\n\"Ye might not wanna do that…\" he chuckles, his eyes glinting with malevolent amusement.\n\nBut the haze in my mind seems to thicken, dulling my senses to everything but the perverse curiosity and the inexplicable pull of the vile liquid before me. My lips touch the brim of the mug, and the thick, yellowed goblin sperm coats them—hot, disgustingly creamy, and intrusively viscous.\n\nThe mug touches my lips, the warm, viscous fluid kissing my mouth with a depravity that should have sent me reeling. Instead, a bolt of wicked pleasure shoots through my brain, obliterating reason.\n\nI suck at the rim, a shudder coursing through my body as the thick liquid starts to slide down my throat. It's a horrifying sensation, the warmth of it splaying out in my stomach like a vile, spreading stain. I can feel each heavy, gloppy drop of it sending waves of chemicals and toxins throughout my veins, altering me, rearranging my thoughts into a muddled, dazed confusion.\n\n\"Best stop, if ye ever wanna see Elara again,\" he taunts, but the caution in his words seems distant, muffled by the thick fog that clouds my mind.\n\nThe warning barely registers.\n\nDriven by a monstrous, inexplicable need, I lift the mug again, the heavy, filthy substance pressing against my lips. I take a fat swig of the goblin excretion, feeling a huge glop of it forcing its way down my throat.\n\nI’m caught in the throes of an obscene addiction, the first taste igniting a shameful craving. I lift the mug again, my lips parting to take a deep, greedy swig. The heavy, chunky fluid pours into my mouth, a flood of filth that overwhelms me.\n\n\"Cumdump...\" Snib's voice taunts from somewhere far away.\n\nI moan, loud and unabashed, as the cocktail of pheromones and chemicals storm through my brain, lighting up pathways of pleasure that should never have been awakened. My hips buck uncontrollably, a wet, squirting sound filling the hut as I lose myself in a tidal wave of orgasms. Each convulsion is mirrored by a spurt from between my legs, painting the dirty floor with my shame.\n\n\"Drink up, you nasty slut. Swallow it all,\" Snib crows, his voice oozing with vile satisfaction.\n\nAnd I do. I gulp and gulp, the mug never seeming to empty, each swallow a further descent into debasement. The taste is horrendous—acrid, salty, disgustingly fertile. It clings to my palate, a reminder of my utter degradation as I ingest more of his vile seed. My mind reels, thoughts fragmenting, dissolving into a mire of hedonistic impulses.\n\nSnib howls with laughter, his voice cutting through my foggy state with sharp, degrading jibes. \"Look at ye, guzzlin' down goblin jizz like a true cumslut. Keep drinkin', let's fill up that dumb bimbo brain of yours with more of my potent seed!\"\n\nWith each gulp, with each vile squelch of cum sliding down my throat, my pleasure intensifies. I'm screaming now, obscene expletives and debauched admissions spilling from my lips as easily as the juices squirt from between my thighs.\n\n\"Yessss, more... I... I love it... so fucking nasty...\"\n\nThere’s a finality in that last swallow, a closing chapter of who I was. Logic, reason, the remnants of Aldric, dissolve under the overwhelming might of Snib's potent climax. My eyes are glassy, unfocused, my mind lost in a carnal haze that drowns out the world.\n\n“You’re nothing but a cum-stuffed bimbo now. Look at yourself, covered in your mess, filled with my seed. You’ll never be the same again,” Snib sneers, his voice echoing in my foggy mind.\n\nYour brain has been infected by large amounts of goblin pheromones...]Collapsed on the floor, I can barely summon the energy to move. Everywhere feels oversensitive, tingling with the aftereffects of my wild, uncontrollable orgasm.]My eyes widen in horror as I grip the mug tighter. The potent goblin seed it contains is thick and warm - I feel it radiating heat. The smell is overwhelming, the heavy musk making my stomach churn. \"No,\" I whimper, shaking my head in protest.\n\n“Heh. Right answer, cowtits,” he snorts, his grin growing wider. \"That's what makes it so fun. Bet you're more worried about that mug than any ale you've ever drunk. Could make ya crazy, couldn't it?\"\n\nI gasp, feeling a knot of fear twisting in my stomach. I clutch the mug tighter, praying to every deity I know that none of the vile liquid would spill on me. The smell is overwhelming, the potent scent filling my nostrils, threatening to choke me.]Snib's horrendous laughter echoes behind me as I stagger out of the hut. The weight of my over-generous breasts bounces with each frantic step, the gross, sticky semen from his unload clinging to my skin and running down my tummy, disgustingly warm and reeking of his vile musk.\n\nI'm topless, the desert sun harsh against my pale skin, every jiggly movement a shameful reminder of my degradation. The sand underfoot burns slightly, but the grit of it seems like a potential salvation. Pulling at the leash that trails behind me in the sand, barely noticing the chafing it causes around my neck, I drop to my knees near a patch of coarse sand.\n\nI grab handfuls of the sand, scrubbing it against my cum-stained breasts. The coarse grit scrapes uncomfortably against my tender skin but I press on, desperate to remove every trace of Snib's seed.\n\nDespite my vigorous efforts, the stickiness persists, the mingled scent of cum and sweat overpowering in the heat. Sobs wrack my body as I paw at myself, the sand turning into a foul mud with the mixture of cum and my own tears.\n\n\"Look at you, scrubbing like a dog in the dirt. What a sight!\" Snib calls out.\n\nHumiliated but relentless, I scramble to my feet and rush to the old well, the wooden bucket barely holding together.\n\nHauling bucket after bucket of water, I douse myself repeatedly. The cool liquid offers a momentary respite from the heat and the stench, but as the water runs down my curves, it fails to wash away the deeper stench of goblin sperm. Each bucketful seems to do little against the cloying, musky smell that clings to me.\n\nI scrub fiercely with my hands, my nails scraping against my skin in desperate arcs, trying to cleanse myself of the contamination. Streams of water mixed with traces of white run down my thighs, soaking into the sand.\n\nBent over the well, my heavy tits swinging and sloshing with each movement, tears mingling with the well water, I'm a picture of a defiled girl, gasping for breath through my sobs. The realization hits me—this isn't just a physical stain; it's a mark on my soul, and the smell is somehow infecting my brain.\n\nThe fear grips tighter at my heart, a cold vice that suffocates. What if I can't get it off? What if it changes me before I can rid myself of it? Panic rises like bile, acidic and choking.\n\n\"Enough of that now, come back in,\" Snib's voice cuts through my frantic thoughts, a harsh command that I find myself powerless to disobey.\n\nAs I trudge back to the hut, the leash tugging at my neck, my body cold and wet but still reeking of his discharge, I feel the last of my dignity drain away. The sun beats down, hard and unyielding, mirroring the harsh reality of my existence.\n\nEach step is heavier than the last, the stench of goblin cum a cruel ghost that haunts me, clinging stubbornly to my skin despite my desperate attempts to eradicate it. Back in the shadow of the hut, Snib's leer is triumphant, degrading.\n\n\"You'll never wash off what I've given you,\" he jeers as he yanks me inside, the door closing behind with a thud that sounds suspiciously like the sealing of my fate.\n\n[Choice: He's satisfied...",

Named after the First Goblin - he filled the world with his brood.\"\n\nMy breath catches in my throat as he speaks, his words painting a disturbing picture of goblin fertility. )The mug feels even heavier in my hands, its contents squirming and writhing.\n\nHe laughs at my reaction, his yellow eyes glinting with cruel amusement. \"We follow the Principle of Might, the Sanctity of Spreading Seed. Dominance. Power. The strongest gobs, they get Storak's mark on their skin, tell tales of conquest and fertility.\"\n\nEvery word he utters only serves to intensify the fear I feel. His seed), now filling the mug in my hands, is not just a product of his lust, but a symbol of his religion, his strength, his dominance.\n\nIf anything, I’m surprised at the complexity of this goblin religion. I suppose the only goblins I’ve encountered are more primitive tribes, unlike the ones up north.\n\nHe talks of their Zog-Naks, their Blood Rites, and the hedonistic Grulkaz-Naks. His words paint a terrifying picture of a society that revels in physical prowess and raw sexuality.\n\n\"We gobs, we Grukk the other races, show them our power,\" he boasts, his eyes never leaving mine. \"And when we die, our spirits return to Storak's loins, ready to be sown into the world again.\"\n\nThe implication of his words hit me like a blow.)The mug in my hand, filled to the brim with his potent seed, it's]A goblin cumming, defiling someone with seed, is] not just about pleasure. It's a physical manifestation of his religion, his belief, his power. It's a symbol of his dominance, his belief that he can subjugate me, break me, just as his religion allows him to do.)\n\nFinally, he releases my leash. I barely register the action as I dart outside, the heavy mug in my hand threatening to spill its vile contents. The sand beneath my feet feels gritty and rough, but it's a welcome contrast to the hot, stinking hut.\n\nI can hear his laughter echoing behind me as I tip the mug, watching in disgusted fascination as the thick goblin seed oozes out, forming a sticky pool in the sand. It sinks into the ground slowly, as if the earth itself is reluctant to accept it.\n\nI'm left standing there, gasping for breath, as the last traces of his cum disappear into the sand. The act feels monumental, a small victory in the face of his relentless dominance. I can still smell the heavy musk of his release, can still feel the heat radiating off the mug. I dunk it in sand, hoping beyond hope the scent will come out.\n\nAnd today, I have *let* him break me.\n\n\"C'mon, cow-tits, let's get ye home!\"\n\n[Choice: He brings you to Eboncrest, as agreed...",

A lump forms in my throat as I see the discomfort in her kind eyes. I flinch.\n\n\"It's Elise for now… my love... I correct, gently, my voice a soft whisper as I meet her gaze. “Oh, Elara…” I breathe out, my voice barely above a whisper as I drink in the sight of her. Her chestnut locks tumble down her shoulders, the ends kissed by the early morning sun. A pang of longing surges within me. How I yearn to brush those soft waves away from her face, to lose myself in the warmth of her gaze once again.\n\nI can almost feel the heat of her blush, but instead of turning away, she steps forward, gently clasping my hand.\n\n“You must be freezing,\" she murmurs, her voice tender with concern. With her other hand, she offers me a simple gown, a soft fabric dyed in earthen tones. Relief washes over me as I hastily shrug off my demeaning armor and pull the gown over my head, savoring the warmth it offers. The normalcy of these soft clothes.\n\nOnce inside, Elara ushers me into the cozy living room. The plush furniture, warm tapestries, and roaring hearth exude a sense of tranquility that I've missed desperately. I settle onto the comfortable couch, allowing the welcoming aura of the room to envelop me.\n\nElara returns from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with freshly baked bread, a pot of honey, and steaming herbal tea. The tantalizing aroma fills the room, and I realize just how much I've missed her cooking. Tears well up in my eyes, and I quickly look away, hoping she won't notice.\n\n\"Elara,\" I begin, taking a deep breath to steady my voice, \"I need to tell you something.\"\n\nHer brow furrows with concern, but she silently gestures for me to continue.\n\n[Choice: I need to leave at dusk...",

I must get going by dusk.”\n\n)She pales at my words, her hand coming up to cover her mouth. \"Oh...\" she whispers, the depth of her anguish echoing my own.\n\nDespite the bitter reality, this fleeting moment of peace, of home, has invigorated me. The affection emanating from Elara, the homely charm of this abode, the lingering taste of her cooking, all remind me of what I'm fighting for.\n\nHer fingers dance on my bare arm.\n\n\"Elise, I... I can't bear this... him. Snib, he's not... He’s not abusing you, is he?”\n\n(The cum in your belly is affecting your mind)\n\nOut of some haze-infested corner of my mind, words slip before I can catch them. \"No, Elara, he's... Master takes care... I mean—”\n\nHer eyes widen, hurt flashing across her features. \"Why would you call him that when he's not even here?\" she asks, confusion etched deeply into her expression.\n\n\"I... don't know why I said that,\" I mumble, feeling a rise of panic.\n\n\"That... armor,” she stutters, \"it must be so uncomfortable.\"\n\nI glance down, my gaze drawn to the high-heeled boots still adorning my feet. A flush creeps over my cheeks, the familiar heat reminding me of my debasement. \"Yes,\" I admit, \"it is.\"\n\nShe takes my hands, her grip firm yet soft. \"I hate seeing you like this, walking around the town, the way they look at you... It's... it's...\"\n\nDrawing a deep breath, which causes my voluptuous chest to heave, I reply, \"He expects it. He’s... assertive. It's just how Master is... I mean, Snib. I don’t know why I said that again...”\n\nElara's eyebrows knit together, a mixture of concern and anger in her eyes. “Elise, you’re... you’re not yourself. What has he done to you?” Her voice rises, tinged with frustration and fear.\n\nMy heart squeezes tight, my insides roiling with the squatting presence of Snib's disgusting influence. \"I... I think I need a bath,\" I say quickly, eager to change the subject, to cleanse myself of the foulness I can almost feel seeping out of my pores. \"I... I probably smell terrible, don't I?\"\n\n“Yes, you do,” she agrees, her tone softening as her worry overtakes her anger. \"You should have a bath. Maybe it will help clear your head.\"\n\nHer soft fingers stroke my arm, sending a shiver down my spine. The comfort she offers is a sorely needed balm, and despite the wretched haze clouding my senses, I latch onto it like a lifeline. \"Thank you, Elara,\" I whisper, a tear escaping down my cheek. “I do feel quite filthy after... everything.”\n\nAs Elara moves to prepare the bath, I'm left in the quiet comfort of our home, peeling off the boots and letting my feet relish the soft, cool ground. Wrapped in the loose gown, I feel somewhat shielded from the harsh reality of my servitude. For a fleeting moment, under the soft fabric, I manage to forget the heavy, vile load festering within me, focusing instead on the soothing prospect of a warm bath.\n\n[Choice: Go upstairs to take a bath!]She pales at my words, her hand coming up to cover her mouth. \"Oh...\" she whispers, the depth of her anguish echoing my own.\n\nDespite the bitter reality, this fleeting moment of peace, of home, has invigorated me.

I can't bear this... him. Snib, he's not... He’s not abusing you, is he?”\n\nI can see the concern in her eyes and it kills me. I want to tell her everything, to pour out all the degradation and humiliation Snib has forced upon me. To have SOMEONE to confide in. But I don't. I can't. The vision of her hurt, her despair, it's unbearable. So, I shake my head, my raven locks tumbling over my shoulders, down the cavernous cleavage of my enormous breasts. \"No, Elara... he's not... he's not hurting me.\" My voice is a soft, feminine whisper that's still strange to my own ears.\n\nShe stares at the skimpy metal bikini discarded on the side, eyes tracing the razor-thin lines of the garment. \"That... armor,” she stutters, \"it must be so uncomfortable.\"\n\nI glance down, my gaze drawn to the high-heeled boots on my feet. I can't help but blush, my skin feels hot, a scalding reminder of the humiliation. \"Yes,\" I admit, \"it is.\"\n\nShe takes my hands, her grip firm yet soft. \"I hate seeing you like this, walking around the town, the way they look at you... It's... it's...\"\n\nShe can't finish the sentence, but she doesn't need to. I can see it in her eyes, the horror, the revulsion. But there's also something else: fear. Fear for me. I take a deep breath, my full breasts heaving with the motion. “He’s devious…. I… I have to wear it, Elara. If I don't, he... he might... Punish me-”\n\nElara interrupts, her voice firm. “No point in delaying. We need to get this collar off you, Elise. I'll call for the town wizard. He may be able to figure out something about this... this curse.\"\n\nI do not share her optimism - this is an ancient artifact, after all. Quite likely beyond our wizard’s skills. But my wife’s determination shines through her fear, and I can't help but love her more for it. \"Thank you,\" I whisper, squeezing her hand. “Let’s do that. And Elara… could I... could I use the bath? I... I feel so dirty. All this time in a goblin hut.”\n\nHer eyes soften immediately. \"Of course, my love. You deserve to feel clean... and comfortable.\" She gently strokes my arm, and I feel goosebumps rise on my skin. The comfort she offers is a balm for my tortured spirit.\n\nAs Elara leaves to make arrangements, I'm left in the serene quiet of our home. I peel off the boots, letting out a relieved sigh as my feet touch the soft, cool ground. In this comfy, loose gown, I feel a sense of reprieve. It billows around my voluptuous figure, my breasts and ass for once hidden and respectable. For a moment, I forget about the cursed collar around my neck, my mind taken by the softness of the gown against my sensitive skin.\n\n[Choice: Go upstairs to take a bath!]",

The room itself is carved from local stone, the walls alive with a labyrinth of moss and ivy that release a calming, earthy scent.\n\nIn the center sits our grand wooden tub - an extravagant purchase she’d convinced me to make a while ago, the sides curved and polished, filled with steaming water. Floating atop are petals of yarrow and chamomile, their healing aromas filling the room. Elara assists me, her hands gently steadying me as I climb into the tub. The water, imbued with herbal essences, laps at my thighs, then my waist, and finally swallows my heaving breasts, the warmth seeping into every pore, every nerve.\n\nOnce I'm seated, Elara retrieves a woven sponge from a side table, dipping it into a clay jar filled with a thick, fragrant mixture. \"It's a blend of rosemary, honey, and some moonwort,\" she explains, her smile soft. \"It's good for the skin, especially after you've been... well, out and about.\"\n\nDespite everything, I feel a chuckle rumble in my chest, my breasts wobbling at the motion. She's trying to lighten the mood and I appreciate it more than I can say. Her hand works the sponge across my arms, her movements slow and gentle. The concoction feels soothing, easing the discomfort of the rough metal bikini I'd been forced into.\n\nHer hands then move to my breasts. I blush, unaccustomed to being touched this way, yet Elara continues, her gaze steady, the sponge working in circular motions. \"They're sensitive, I know,\" she murmurs. \"But it's important to keep them clean.\"\n\nShe guides me, her hands over mine, showing me how to clean myself. It's odd, almost surreal, being taught these things by my wife. But in her touch, her patience, her guidance, I find a comfort I'd forgotten existed.\n\nNext, she turns her attention to my hair. She scoops a handful of the bath water, pouring it over my black tresses. Then, she takes a paste of crushed lavender and rose petals mixed with egg yolks, applying it to my hair. \"The egg nourishes the hair, makes it shiny,\" she explains, her fingers skillfully massaging the mixture into my scalp. \"The roses and lavender... well, they make it smell nice.\"\n\nAfter a while, she rinses my hair, the water carrying the remnants of the paste and grime away. I close my eyes, leaning back against her, the calming scent of lavender and roses filling my senses.\n\n“I sent for the wizard earlier,” she announces softly. \"He should be here soon.\"\n\nHer voice is a comforting whisper, and her hands, her touch, they ground me. In this moment, stripped of my armor, my identity, she still sees me. She still loves me.\n\nOnce I am done bathing, Elara helps me stand, the water cascading off my curves in rivulets. The cool air of the chamber causes my skin to prickle, my nipples hardening against the chill. Elara reaches for a towel, a plush fabric spun from the fleece of hill sheep. Her hands are gentle, patient as she dries me off. Elara treats me with a delicate care that warms my heart.\n\n\"All right, my love, let's get you properly dressed,\" Elara announces, a gentle smile dancing on her lips.\n\n[Choice: Get dressed.",

Her sapphire eyes scan the various garments hanging there, an array of colors and fabrics crafted by the skilled seamstresses of our town.\n\nShe stops at a fine linen chemise, pulling it out and holding it up to the light. \"This first, Elise,\" she says, her cheeks tinged with a soft blush as she explains. \"It's light, airy, and will keep your skin from chafing against the heavier fabrics.\"\n\nI step into the chemise, the lightweight linen flowing down to just above my knees. It's loose, but cinches slightly at the waist, the material soft against my sensitive skin. Elara adjusts it, ensuring it's properly draped over my wide hips and ample bosom. The cool linen feels soothing after the abrasive metal of the goblin’s “armor”.\n\nNext, she retrieves a set of stays from a drawer. \"This might feel a bit strange, but it'll give you the support you need.\" The stays, a medieval version of a corset, is made from stiffened cloth with firm boning. She secures it around my waist, the laces pulling snug against my back. I feel it cinch my waist, creating a pleasing hourglass figure, while providing ample support for my large breasts. Despite the initial unfamiliarity, it's oddly comfortable, the structure a welcome contrast to the uncontrolled jiggle of my earlier outfit.\n\nOver the stays, Elara adds a kirtle, a type of undergown. \"This will add another layer of comfort,\" she assures me. The kirtle, made of sturdy wool, molds to the shape created by the stays, making my silhouette more feminine. I can't help but marvel at my reflection, my body looking both familiar and alien at the same time.\n\nFinally, she presents the pièce de résistance - a green velvet gown, the fabric rich and heavy, embroidered with intricate patterns of silver thread. She helps me into it, securing the laces at the back, adjusting the material over my voluptuous figure.\n\nI look at my reflection once more, the green gown making my curves look soft yet commanding, the cut modest yet flattering.\n\n\"Come sit,\" Elara instructs gently, guiding me towards an ornately carved wooden vanity. Its smooth surface is adorned with an array of tortoiseshell combs, boar bristle brushes, and delicate ivory hairpins, each a testament to the detailed craftsmanship of our town's artisans.\n\nShe gently gestures for me to take a seat on the cushioned stool, a comfortable perch from which I can watch her skilled hands in the mirror. She retrieves a wide-toothed silver comb from a lustrous wooden box, the comb's surface etched with delicate floral motifs, the light catching on its polished surface.\n\n\"Now, dear,\" Elara begins, her fingers gently gathering my raven tresses, \"having long hair requires a bit more effort. But with the right techniques, it can be manageable, even in the heat of battle.\"\n\nShe begins to work the comb through my hair, starting at the ends and gradually working her way up to my roots to minimize any tugging. The sensation is strange, but undeniably soothing, the cool metal tines gliding smoothly through my hair, removing any knots and tangles.\n\nHer hands, skilled and gentle, work with an enviable grace. She twists my hair into an elegant chignon, securing it with a few ornate hairpins. A few loose tendrils are left free to frame my face, adding a soft femininity to my appearance.\n\n\"For day-to-day,\" she continues, her hands releasing my hair and picking up another tool, \"you could consider a simple braid. It will keep your hair out of the way during combat, and it's quite easy to do.\" Elara demonstrates on a small section of hair, her fingers quickly weaving the strands into a neat plait. \"See? With a bit of practice, you could do this yourself.\"\n\nFinally, she adorns me with a string of pearls, their cool weight a comfort against my collarbone, and a pair of delicate silver earrings. The outfit, the hairstyle, the jewelry - they transform my reflection into something almost noble, a far cry from the degrading attire I had been forced into.\n\n\"Elise,\" Elara's soft voice echoes in the quiet room, her eyes meeting mine in the mirror, \"you really are beautiful.\"\n\nEven under the weight of the goblin's curse, her words bring a sense of solace. Despite the situation, I can't help but appreciate the effort and care Elara has put into this moment. It is a stark reminder that despite the outward transformation, I am still Aldric in essence, cherished by my loving wife.\n\nMy eyes move up, drawn to the thing that contradicts the splendor of my outfit – the harsh, unyielding collar locked around my neck. The vile, pulsating runes etched into its surface are a stark reminder of the curse that has thrust me into this predicament.\n\nA surge of emotions overwhelms me at the sight. Shame, guilt, disgust - they mingle and churn in my stomach, threatening to spill over. My vision blurs, and I blink rapidly, but it does no good. Tears stream down my face, carving hot paths down my cheeks, marring my otherwise perfect appearance.\n\n\"Elise...\" Elara's voice is soft, barely a whisper, yet it resonates loudly in the quiet room. Her arms encircle me from behind, offering solace and comfort. I can feel her heartbeat against my back, its steady rhythm a calming lullaby amidst my chaotic thoughts.\n\n\"I... I...\" My words get choked in my throat, stifled by the guilt gnawing at me. The reflection that was once one of dignity and elegance is now distorted by my own shame and despair. Would Elara's love remain so steadfast if she knew of my betrayal? The vile things Snib made me do?\n\n\"Hush, my love,\" she murmurs, her fingers threading through my hair, untangling the knots of my guilt and regret. \"None of this is your fault. You've been stronger than anyone else could have been in your situation.\"\n\n\"I... I need to be stronger, for you,\" I manage to choke out between sobs, my fingers clutching at the soft fabric of her dress, seeking anchorage amidst my turmoil.\n\n\"And you will be,\" she assures me, her voice steady, filled with a conviction I wish I could mirror. \"We will fight this, my love. Together.\" Her words ring through the room, a beacon of hope amidst my gloom.\n\nI take a deep, shuddering breath, trying to find some semblance of calm. I won't let this defeat me. I won't let Snib ruin me. I love Elara too much to give up.\n\n\"I... I will fight,\" I affirm, my voice barely above a whisper. I meet her eyes in the mirror, finding strength in their sapphire depths. \"I will reclaim my freedom... for us.\"\n\n[Choice: Master Fendril arrives.",

A pair of spectacles perches precariously on the bridge of his nose, giving his gray eyes an exaggerated, owl-like appearance. His robe, a patchwork of different fabrics and colors, swirls around him as he steps inside, a testament to his eccentricity.\n\n“I’m sorry for my delay, Elara, I came as soon as I could,” Fendril greets, his voice a gentle, soothing baritone. His eyes then fall on me, and his eyebrows shoot up behind his glasses in shock. \"By the gods, Aldric? Is it... is it truly you under there?\"\n\n\"Yes, Fendril,\" I nod solemnly. \"The collar did… all this.\"\n\nFendril advances slowly, his face a mask of concern. When he's close enough, he stretches out a hand, an intricate network of pulsing magical lines illuminating his palm. A scanning spell.\n\n\"Mind your touch,\" I warn, the collar a cold, uncomfortable presence against my throat. \"The collar has a mind of its own.”\n\nHe nods, his fingers moving above the collar, just far enough to avoid contact, his spell probing and inspecting. I can feel the vibrations of magic, subtle waves of energy washing over me. He mutters incantations under his breath, invoking higher spells of identification, detection, and unraveling. His eyes widen, revealing a deep sense of unease, yet fascination.\n\n\"This is highly complex. The collar's enchantment is unlike anything I've encountered before,\" Fendril furrows his brow. He draws back, giving me a moment's respite from the tickle of his magic, and related to Thraan-Vek.\n\n“The collar was found in the depths of the Ironrock mine,\" I say. \"In a ruin one of the mine shafts had broken into.”\n\nFendril hums at my words, his gaze flicking to Elara momentarily before returning to the cruel piece of ‘jewelry’ locking around my throat. His fingers trace the air, drawing shimmering glyphs that self-suspend, flickering with spectral flames. These are components of the Argent Codex, an esoteric script of high-level magic rarely known to, let alone mastered by, contemporary mages. Far beyond my own combat magic.\n\n\"I recognize only a few of these inscriptions,\" Fendril murmurs, his eyes roving over the holographic recreation of the collar. \"They're Argent symbols, quite potent. I haven't seen their like since my studies at the Grand Hall.”\n\nHis touch hovers above the runes, casting shadows on his worn, weathered face. A frown creases his forehead as he attempts to parse the entwined symbols.\n\n\"See here,\" he points to a constellation of dark, pulsing runes, \"this one represents dominion, control. That one beside it,\" he moves to a twisted, knot-like symbol, \"that's transformation. But what's peculiar is this last symbol, the one that's threaded through the others. It's... oh dear.\"\n\nHe steps back abruptly, concern etching lines into his face.\n\n\"That's an Elder Glyph. It represents connection, but in this context, it's more... ominous. It's a connection to an entity, a higher power, one that likely resides within the collar.\"\n\n[Choice: A chill runs down your spine.",

The entity probably saw an opportunity to exert influence in our realm and took it. The creature is just the convenient medium.\"\n\nHe gazes at the collar with a renewed sense of wariness. \"The transformation and obedience... it's fueled by an immense source of magical energy. More than any mortal could provide. More than any mortal should meddle with.\"\n\nElara's fingers tighten on my arm, her face a mask of worry. \"Can you remove it, Fendril?\"\n\nHe meets her gaze, his own reflecting deep regret. \"The only way to remove this collar without risk would be by the goblin’s command. To attempt to forcibly remove it, with the level of magic involved... it could easily prove fatal.\"\n\nI shudder at the word, 'fatal,' the collar tightening ever so slightly around my throat, a chilling reminder of the dire consequences should I disobey Snib. A bead of sweat trickles down the side of my face, disappearing into the neckline of my gown.\n\nMaster Fendril seems to catch the subtle movement of the collar, his brows furrowing in thought. His gaze is drawn back to the dark symbols, glowing menacingly in the spectral light of his glyphs.\n\n\"I'll send a message to the Grand Hall immediately,\" he says, breaking the tense silence that has fallen over the room. “To one of my old colleagues, Master Zephyrion, who specializes in ancient curses and potent artifacts like this one.

Placing it in the palm of his hand, he murmurs a short incantation, causing the crystal to pulse and flicker with ethereal light.\n\n\"Go,\" he commands the crystal, and it zips out of the room through the open window.\n\nMy wife squeezes my hand.\n\n\"Master Zephyrion should be here within a few days,\" Fendril assures us, his gaze meeting mine. “I have… highlighted the urgency.”\n\n“Th- thank you,” I say.

His gaze is sympathetic, his voice firm. \"Just hang on for a few more days, Elise. We will find a way out of this.

Our fingers are intertwined, a silent vow of our unwavering bond amidst this unsettling ordeal.

The shopkeeper, an aged gnome with a mop of frizzy hair, peers at me curiously from behind an ornately carved counter.\n\nA sense of dread crawls up my spine as I scan the shelves for the item I need. The fear of coming into direct contact with Snib's disgusting, monstrous pheromone-laden sperm, a weapon of his domination, has driven me to this point. And despite the embarrassment, I'm determined to make this purchase.\n\nHesitatingly, I approach the counter. \"I need... protection,\" I whisper, blushing furiously.\n\nThe gnome tilts his head, squinting up at me. Then, a knowing glint appears in his beady eyes. With a nonchalant shrug, he retrieves a wooden box from beneath the counter, opening the lid to reveal neatly packed rows of rubbery, translucent sheaths - condoms.\n\nIn the hushed aura of the quaint shop, I find my cheeks flaming at the sight of these objects designed to encapsulate a man's... or in my case, a goblin's arousal. If the packaging is to be believed, these rubber sheaths are imbued with a light resizing enchantment, stretching to accommodate any size.\n\nYou bought condoms.]Hastily, I count out fifty gold pieces, an exorbitant price but worth the semblance of control they provide.

I turn to exit, my heart pounding with a strange mix of relief and apprehension.\n\nJust as I'm stepping out of the shop, Elara reappears, arms full of foodstuffs. \"Found what you were looking for?\" she inquires, her gaze curious yet innocent.\n\nWith a curt nod and a forced smile, I guide us back toward the bustling marketplace, the weight of the box a secret burden nestled within my bag. As we walk, my mind is besieged with images of Snib's enormous cock, the mental images igniting a hot blush on my cheeks.

      "text": "The warmth of Elara's hand in mine is the only source of comfort as I step towards the city gates. Clad once again in the degrading bikini armor, my heavy breasts and generous hips exposed to the world, I can't help but cringe at the feel of cold metal against my sensitive flesh - no more gowns. No more baths. Each movement sends jolts of discomfort through me, the armor's minuscule size leaving nothing to the imagination.\n\nI carry a satchel with me now, a collection of comforts we’d purchased that I can bring to Snib’s hut.\n\nElara gives me a final kiss goodbye before I head out.\n\nAt the city gates, my goblin overlord awaits, his beady eyes gleaming with anticipation as he ogles my voluptuous figure. The loincloth barely covers his disgusting cock, the sight of it triggering a wave of nausea and an undesired reaction from my traitorous body.\n\n\"Well, cow tits. Did you have fun with yer wife?\" His voice is a raspy sneer, and I force myself to respond with a respectful nod, the collar around my neck tightening in a threatening reminder.\n\n\"Yes, master,\" I manage, forcing each word out. My stomach churns at the thought of returning to his loathsome hut, of pleasuring his beastly member, of the warm, heavy spurts of his seed... I can't allow my mind to wander there, not now.\n\nHis musk seems a bit more muted now, a bit less… overpowering. Still there, but not crippling. It must be the Moonshade, having at least some semblance of an effect.\n\nWith a newfound determination, I turn my back to the city, my heart heavy with the painful goodbye. The sun dips below the horizon as we set off, the sight of Elara growing smaller until she's nothing more than a speck in the distance.\n\nAs the reality of my situation once again sinks in, I grip the reins of the beast tighter, the harsh desert wind whipping my raven hair around. The journey back to Snib's hut is a solemn one, filled with silence and the looming dread of what awaits me there. But beneath it all, there's a glimmer of hope, a resolve that wasn't there before.\n\n[Choice: The next day...",

      "text": "--- Chapter 7: The Griznak Gobboree ---\nThe heat of the Zaelasian sun is relentless, its powerful rays searing the landscape into a dazzling gold panorama of the Shifting Sands. The surreal beauty of the dunes is beguiling, shifting and shimmering like an elusive dream just beyond grasp.\n\nI'm squeezed onto the saddle in front of Snib, the coarse, sun-warmed leather rubbing against my scantily clad skin. My pride, once a mighty force within me, is now a muffled echo, drowned out by the humiliating tableau I present, the damsel reduced to a subservient creature.\n\nYet, amidst the heat and humiliation, I cling to a tiny kernel of hope. Just a few more days, I tell myself.\n\nThe abrasive material of my metallic bikini grates against my skin, transforming every jostle and bounce into a torturous experience. My breasts, constricted by the bikini top, move in rhythm with Jarkrond’s galloping hooves, the constant jiggling an unwelcome reminder of my predicament.\n\nI hear Snib's husky voice, tainted with crude amusement, whispering in my ear, \"Excited for da caravan, cow tits?\" His hands, rough and surprisingly strong, dig into the soft flesh of my ass, making me grit my teeth.\n\nThe saddlebags, heavily laden with our provisions, bounce against Jarkrond's muscular flanks. They hold an assortment of essential goods - food, water, the condoms I had bought in a burst of foresight, and my precious vial of Moonshade potion, a secret weapon that Snib is thankfully oblivious to.\n\nMy mind wanders amidst the monotony of our trek, and I find myself drawn to thoughts of Elara. Her soft gaze, the tenderness in her touch, and the lingering taste of her lips offer a beacon of hope. It soothes the raw and aching wounds of my spirit, but it's a bittersweet solace, stirring a longing that can't be quenched in this desolate landscape.\n\nAnd then I feel it, an insistent pressure against my lower back, an unwelcome, pulsating heat. I don’t need to look to know what it is. Snib’s arousal. I suppress a shudder, refusing to let the lewd contact break me. I am more than the sum of these degrading moments, I remind myself, focusing my gaze on the distant horizon.\n\nThe constant motion of Jarkrond's stride wedges Snib even closer, causing him to grind against me with a jarring rhythm. His fat cock, an unsettling presence nestled between the curves of my ass, twitches with a life of its own. Each rhythm of our joined bodies sends a sickening thrill through me as his rigid, pulsating mass scrapes against my sensitive skin.\n\nAn involuntary gasp escapes my lips as I feel something hot and sticky against the small of my back, an unmistakable sign of Snib's virility. His precum, as revolting as it is warm, seeps through his threadbare loincloth, slathering my skin with its wet presence.\n\nThe base animalistic nature of his actions sends a shockwave of reluctant arousal through me, a shameful ripple that moistens my bikini bottom. Yet, the Moonshade potion that I ingested in the morning works its magic, dulling the typical reactions of my body, making this degrading situation slightly more bearable.\n\nHowever, the potion cannot mitigate the reality of having a goblin's engorged member sandwiched between my bouncing ass cheeks. The cloth barrier, inadequate as it is, does nothing to dampen the sensation of his monstrous cock, thick and hot against my bare skin. The intense heat radiating from his arousal is palpable, his precum acting as a disgusting lubricant that allows his cock to slide rhythmically in the crevice of my ass.\n\nI am acutely aware of his hard, insistent length throbbing between my cheeks, the uncomfortable mix of heat and wetness sending shivers down my spine. The physical reality of the situation is crude and stark, and even the Moonshade potion can't erase the looming presence of Snib's grotesque virility.\n\nHis hand tightens on my hip, his knobby fingers digging into my soft flesh as he adjusts his stance in the saddle. His other hand finds my bouncing ass cheek, grabbing it with a disgusting eagerness, his nails scratching against my skin. He shifts his hips, aligning himself with the cleft of my ass, the heat of his excitement pressing against my lower back.\n\nWithout a word of warning, he begins to pump himself between my ass cheeks, using my body as nothing more than a masturbatory tool. The steady rhythm of Jarkrond's galloping fuels Snib's pleasure, his movements becoming more frenzied with each stride.\n\nI can feel every twitch, every pulse of his enormous member as it grinds between my soft cheeks. His cock, slick with precum and coated with a layer of smegma, slides with an obscene ease. The sticky residue, nauseating in its consistency, adds a layer of slime that mixes with his precum, turning my back into a canvas of his arousal.\n\n[Choice: Whimper.",

His fingers find purchase in the soft roundness, spreading my cheeks apart to accommodate his slick, turgid intrusion.

The lack of a condom means every twitch, every pulse of his hideous dick is smeared directly against my skin, his precum and smegma creating a slick, vile trail that defiles my very core.\n\n\"You're such a good slut, letting me grind this meat stick deep in your whore trench,\" Snib jeers, his voice dripping with mockery as he emphasizes each filthy word to degrade me further.\n\nThe horse’s galloping rhythm only adds a perverse tempo to the filthy show, my ass cheeks clapping back against his groin with each and every heavy thrust. I feel exposed, debased—this is so wrong on countless levels, not just physically but morally.\n\nThe goblin hotdogs my ass cheeks with his bulbous cock, the filthy friction accompanied by lewd, wet noises that make my stomach churn with disgust. \"Gonna have fun watching those fat cheeks bounce while you try to fight. Won't be long 'till you're begging for my cock,\" he leers, delivering a sharp spank to my already abused flesh.\n\nAs the relentless heat of his throbbing cock burrows deeper, spreading my plump cheeks apart with his lewd grinding, Snib leans forward. He slaps one cheek hard, the sound echoing off the barren sand dunes around us.\n\n\"Gonna use this fatty ass till I'm bored of it... But I ain't never bored of such jiggly fun,\" he growls, his fingers dig into my tender flesh, kneading it like dough.\n\nI’m trapped in this depraved act, feeling every pulse, every vein of his grotesque member as he uses me like a thing, a tool for his pleasure. Each slick slide of his filthy member leaves a trail of his slimy essence, a sticky reminder of his dominion over me.\n\nHis thrusts grow fervent, frenzied as he speaks again, this time his breath coming hotter, his words darker. \"Listen well, cumdump,\" he rasps, his voice coarse against my ear, “At the Griznak Gobboree, your tits and ass will be earning me a fortune in the fighting pits.\"\n\nHe punctuates his words with a particularly harsh thrust, causing my body to jolt, a gasp escaping clenched teeth.\n\nGrabbing a handful of my plump ass cheek, he spreads them, providing his disgusting member a deeper furrow to desecrate.\n\n\"Perfect slut cushion for my cock,\" Snib grunts, his pace increasing with Jarkrond's gallops. “And no one will think that under those pretty titties is a fighter’s brain! Gonna earn us so much gold.”\n\nEach slick, heavy, hot thrust sends a wave of involuntary arousal mixed with profound humiliation coursing through my veins. I grimace as he cups my breasts, his grip tightening, \"You'll be begging for my cock after each fight, your fat ass bouncing on it like the whore you are,\" Snib taunts, his words slicing through me, painting a dreadful picture of what's to come.\n\nThe smugness in his tone, his vile pronouncements of my future debasement under his control—it's too much. Tears sting my eyes, not just from pain but from the wrecked dignity, my spirit being continually crushed under the weight of his loathsome desires.\n\nAs we continue to ride, the endless stretch of desert around us seems like a reflection of my spiraling despair. Bound, humiliated, and used in such a crude display, it's difficult to cling to anything resembling hope or pride. Instead, there's only the searing pain of being debased, reduced to a mere receptacle of this vile creature's lust.\n\nHe claps my ass cheeks one more time, each stroke a fiery imprint on my already burning skin. \"Get used to it, whore,\" he snickers, \"This is your life now!\"\n\n[Choice: He cums!]Gritting my teeth, I manage to squeak out a request. “Master… please… a condom... put it on, “if you’re going to be doing that…”\n\nHis chuckle is low, a grating sound that sets my nerves on edge. \"Oh, I think that's your job, slut,” he says, a sickening glee in his voice.\n\nFor a moment, I freeze. I can barely even touch him without feeling nauseated. But it’s far better than the alternative of getting my back and asscheeks plastered with insanely gross goblin seed.\n\nI reach into the saddlebag, my fingers shaking as I fish out one of the tiny packages. The thing is cool to the touch, a stark contrast to the sweltering desert heat and the infernal warmth radiating from Snib's member.\n\nI tear the paper packet open, the rubber condom spilling onto my trembling fingers. I steal a glance at Snib's massive cock, my stomach twisting in repulsion at the sight of the raw virility pulsing between my ass cheeks. It's almost alien in its size and shape, monstrous and intimidating.\n\nI stretch the condom between my fingers, taking a deep breath before reaching back. My hand trembles as I make contact with his cock, his member twitching at my touch. I wince at the feel of his slimy, pulsing flesh against my fingers, the sticky smegma coating his shaft making my hand slip.\n\nI struggle to roll the condom down his massive girth, the magical material called “latex” stretched thin over his member. It's a battle against his size, the condom barely managing to cover half of his length. It seems to resize itself slightly, imbued with magical properties - yet woefully insufficient for a schlong as enormous as Snib’s. His cock throbs beneath the material.\n\nI fight back the urge to vomit, my fingers slick with sweat and precum as I pull the condom as far as it'll go. The hot, pulsating member strains against the thin barrier, pulsating with a need that makes my stomach churn.\n\n\"There,\" I gasp out, my voice barely above a whisper as I pull my hand away, quickly wiping it against Jarkrond’s rough hide. I feel filthy, a cold sweat breaking out across my skin.\n\nSnib lets out a throaty chuckle, the sound reverberating in my ears. His hands move back to my ass, the roughness of his fingers amplified against the raw sensitivity of my skin. I can feel the coolness of the latex against my cheeks, an unnatural contrast to the fevered heat of his arousal.\n\nWithout wasting a moment, Snib resumes his lewd assault, his monstrous member sliding between my ass cheeks once more. But this time, there's a strange, alien sensation that accompanies each thrust. The condom, stretched thin over his pulsing length, provides a barrier between us, yet it can't dull the sensation of his hot, twitching flesh entirely.\n\nHis thick girth slides against my cheeks with each pump, the latex-covered monstrosity leaving a trail of alien coolness in its wake. The condom, slick with Snib's precum, slides against my skin with a sickening ease, a constant, disturbing reminder of the debasing spectacle unfolding atop Jarkrond's back.\n\nHis movements grow frenzied, each thrust of his hips driving his condom-covered member deeper between my ass cheeks. The perverse squelching noise it makes with each undulation fills the air, mixing with the grunts of pleasure that escape Snib's lips.\n\nEach thrust sends a fresh wave of lewd sensation coursing through me. His pulsating member, straining against the thin latex barrier, grinds against my ass cheeks, his aggressive rhythm matching the steady gallop of Jarkrond's hooves.\n\n\"Listen well, cumdump,\" he rasps, his voice coarse against my ear, “At the Griznak Gobboree, your tits and ass will be earning me a fortune in the fighting pits.\" He punctuates his words with a particularly harsh thrust, causing me to gasp out. “No one will think that under dose pretty titties is a fighter’s brain! Gonna earn us so much gold.”\n\nI can feel his monstrous member, even through the thin sheath of the condom, twitching between my asscheeks, pulsating in time with his cackling laughter. Each of his thrusts sends a jolt through my trembling body, the sensation amplified by the rhythmic bouncing of the horse beneath us.\n\n\"I’ll put you to fight against the other slaves, slut. Your jiggling tits and fat ass bouncing around as you try to fight,\" he says, reaching around to cup one of my massive breasts, squeezing hard enough that I cry out. His thumb flicks over the sensitive underside, and despite my disgust, a flare of unwanted arousal sparks within me.\n\n\"No,\" I protest, but my voice comes out as a whimper.\n\n\"You’ll be begging for my cock soon enough, won’t ya?” he asks, his tone maliciously gleeful. He's squeezing my left breast so hard now, the tight constriction of my skimpy bikini top offering no protection against his brutal fondling.\n\n\"I... I won't!\" I grit out. But even as I say the words, I can feel the dampness growing between my legs. I can’t control it. The musky scent of his precum, even with the latex barrier, is potent in my nostrils, and despite the Moonshade potion, I can feel a responding pulse of desire from deep within me. It dulls the sensation, but doesn’t prevent it completely.\n\nHis laugh is a horrible thing, a grating cackle that makes my skin crawl. But beneath that laughter, there's a sickening pleasure, a delight in my discomfort that only fuels his arousal. \"Your words be sayin’ no, but your slutty body be sayin’ YES,” he says, his words dripping with satisfaction.\n\nHis hand leaves my breast to run over my exposed stomach, tracing the curve of my waist before coming to rest on my jiggling ass once again. “Soon, dat fat ass will be bouncing on my cock, ye’ll be moaning like a bitch in heat.” His words send a shiver down my spine, and I bite back a whimper. “And you’ll be beggin’ for more!”\n\n\"No, I won't... I won't...,\" I repeat, but my words are drowned out by the harsh slap of his hand on my ass, and his deep, throaty laughter.\n\nHis cock is a throbbing heat between my asscheeks, grinding into me with each bounce of the horse. The sensation is overpowering, a relentless pressure that sends waves of humiliation and arousal coursing through me.\n\n\"I look forward to our nights together, cumdump. I'll never need to force you,\" he says, a malicious glint in his eyes. \"Ye’ll be beggin’ for it.”\n\nMy stomach churns at his words, bile rising in my throat even as I feel my cheeks flush. The potent smell of him, his constant degrading comments and the way his colossal cock - encased in a condom but very much potent beneath - grinds against my sweat-slicked ass cheeks, adds to the cocktail of humiliation and involuntary arousal. It's maddening.\n\nHis grimy hands grip my wide, feminine hips, using them as leverage as he starts thrusting in earnest. His hips jerk forward in rhythm with the horse's gallop, causing the monstrous member between my buttocks to twitch and pulse. My green eyes, wide and full of despair, dart towards his looming, virile form. His veiny, purple-tipped goblin cock, monstrous and so unfairly stimulating, throbbed against the latex sheath, a bead of his musky pre-ejaculate inflating the tip of the condom obscenely.\n\nI can't help the shiver that travels down my spine. There's something carnal about the way his cock twitches and pulses against me, something that rouses the traitorous wetness between my legs even more. He's repulsive, but my body's betrayal makes his lewd actions feel like a perverse massage.\n\nHis other hand moves from my hip to snake around my body, finding the underside of my heavy breasts. His rough fingers pinch and roll the soft flesh, sending shockwaves of unwanted pleasure rippling through my body. The horse’s galloping motion only adds to the sensation, causing my breasts to bounce uncontrollably, their obscene jiggling further serving as a source of pleasure for the goblin. I feel a moan escaping my throat, immediately cut off by a sob.\n\n\"Like that, don’t you?\" he grunts, pulling my head back by a handful of my raven hair, forcing me to arch my back, my bouncing tits presenting a delicious view for his perverted eyes. \"You're a dumb slut, you're loving every moment of this, aren't you?\" His words are a slap to my face, the humiliation of my predicament piercing me deeper than his cock ever could.\n\nHis grip on my hair tightens painfully as Snib's thrusts reach a fever pitch, each one driving the throbbing length of his cock against my sweat-slicked ass cheeks with fervor. His grunts become harsher, more animalistic - the unmistakable prelude to his climax.\n\n[Choice: He cums into the condom!]",

I try to brace myself, but nothing can truly prepare me for the humiliation that follows.\n\nWith a grunt, Snib's hips jerk violently. His cock, swollen and vile, spasms violently between the sweaty valley of my ass cheeks. The first rope of cum is monstrous, a scalding jet that shoots a straight line up my back with repulsive force. The sensation is disgustingly warm, vile droplets splattering against the small of my back and sizzling down my spine.\n\n\"Fuck, yeah! Take that, whore!\" Snib howls as he continues to hump between my quivering cheeks. His filthy dick keeps pulsating, each spurt a hellish echo of the last, painting my back and ass in thick, ropey strands of his repugnant climax.\n\nThe cum is horrendous—thick, almost clumpy. It seeps into every crease, every crevice, pooling disgustingly in the indentations of my metallic armor. A particularly heavy rope slaps against the back of my neck.\n\n\"Hah, got it in your fucking hair! It's all messy back here now!\" Snib cackles maniacally, utterly consumed by his depravity. The sound of his laughter is a dirty, scraping noise that grates against my already shattered dignity.\n\nJarkrond whinnies loudly, perhaps in protest or merely spooked by the wild, rhythmic thrusting he's being subjected to unwittingly.\n\n\"Look at that butt, just a filthy cum rag. That's all you're good for, innit?\" Snib spits out, each word a lash upon the remnants of my self-respect.\n\nSnib gives my ass one final, possessive slap, the sound sharply echoing over the sands. \"Good girl, taking it all like that.

Take it, slut, take that gobbo load,” His words are seared into my brain, their demeaning echo mixing with the steadily increasing pulse of his cock against my back. His grunts turn into roars, the guttural sounds echoing in the silent desert. It's terrifyingly powerful, an echo of his potent virility, a testament to his domination.\n\nI can hear the first heavy, muted spurt - a wet, barely audible sound, not unlike the squelch of wet mud under heavy boots. It's immediately followed by the sensation of the rubber against my skin stretching, bloating. It inflates, a perverse testament to his virile goblin seed, the heat from it seeping through the thin barrier and warming my skin.\n\nEach subsequent throb of his cock, each guttural grunt that escapes his lips is accompanied by another muted spurt, the sound barely audible over the sound of the galloping horse and his harsh breathing. But I can feel it, the condom swelling between my ass cheeks, filling rapidly with his prodigious, potent load.\n\nEvery sensation is magnified. The heat of his seed, trapped inside the condom. The gentle, obscene sloshing as it fills, each spurt forcing the rubber to stretch even more. The wet, sticky sounds of his release, as if each heavy glob of cum is a physical manifestation of his demeaning words, of his violation of my body.\n\nIt's a sickeningly realistic sensation, an exaggerated simulation of what his seed would feel like inside me if not for the magical barrier protecting me. My body involuntarily shudders as he continues to fill the condom, his seed warm against my lower back. His release seems endless, the heavy, creamy load stretching the condom to its limits, turning it into a perverse, inflated mockery of a fertility charm.\n\nFinally, the twitching of his monstrous member slows, his grunts growing less frequent until they eventually fade away. But the weight of his load remains, the filled condom heavy and obscenely inflated between my ass cheeks, a constant reminder of his virile, alpha dominance. It's an almost surreal sensation, the way it bobs and sways with the motion of the galloping horse, slapping against my lower back and thighs.\n\nI tremble as I reach behind me, my fingers slipping around the taut latex that swells grotesquely with Snib's sticky, off-colored virility. The condom is hot, radiating an obscene warmth against the small of my back, a sick testament to the potent force of goblin life seething within.\n\nThe galloping rhythm of Jarkrond jostles me, causing my own body to quake against the filled condom. My heavy breasts, bouncing uncontrollably with the horse's strides, chafe against the hard metallic constraints of my bikini armor. My asscheeks jiggle, clapping together, squishing the bloated condom between them, forcing a muted, glutinous sound from the strained rubber.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n\"Look at 'ya, cow tits. Strugglin' wit' that balloon of goblin juice,\" Snib grunts, his gnarled hand gripping my leash and yanking my head back as his other hand fondles my jiggling assets. The taste of humiliation coats my tongue, thick and sour as the acrid stench of Snib's musk invading my senses.\n\nI attempt to maneuver the slick, overfilled condom, but it's a nightmare. It wriggles obscenely against my touch, the latex stretching around the volume of Snib's disgusting load, seeming ready to burst. One thick spurt of cum suddenly squirts from the pressurized condom, the muted, sticky, horrid plop of it landing on Jarkrond's back echoing in my ears. I shudder, a wave of relief washing over me as I realize that I managed to avoid getting any on my own skin.\n\nWith each jolt from the horse's stride, the condom wobbles in my fingers. It's heavy, nauseatingly warm, and disgustingly virile. Each touch feels like dipping my fingers into the very essence of my daily degradation.\n\n\"'aving trouble there, bitch?\" Snib cackles as he gives my ass a sharp spank, his slimy laughter intertwining with the squelching noises from the overfilled condom.\n\nMy ass stings, but I grit my teeth and focus on the squishy sensation of the cum-filled condom. I whimper, my shaky fingers fumbling to tie off the latex pouch, my once-heroic hands now trembling with the sickening task.\n\nI bite my lip, fighting the welling tears of humiliation as I secure the knot. It's still pulsating with virile life, each ripple in the translucent material a grotesque dance of Snib's seed. I toss the filled condom onto the desert floor, the soft thud of it hitting the sand barely heard over Jarkrond's hooves pounding against the dry desert ground.\n\n\"Good job, cumdump,\" Snib praises, his condescending tone ringing clear as the morning bells of Eboncrest. His slimy fingers trace the curve of my waist, moving to grope my breasts once more.\n\nI swallow hard, feeling a lump in my throat, a physical manifestation of my humiliation. The desert horizons blur as I watch the condom disappear in the dust, lost to the relentless desert winds. Hopefully no poor adventurer comes across it…\n\n[Choice: He starts talking about the Gobboree...",

      "text": "As the desert rolls by, my goblin master has a tight grip on my waist, his fingers digging into the soft, porcelain flesh of my belly.\n\n\"You know, cowtits,” Snib's voice slithers into my ear, the reek of his breath fills my nostrils.\n\nMy body rebels against my revulsion as he licks my back, the all-too-familiar warmth of arousal spreading through my belly.\n\n\"We're headed to the Griznak Gobboree,\" Snib continues, ignoring my discomfort, his fingers idly trace a line along my bare thigh. The distinct grating sound of his claws against the metal boot send chills down my spine. “Not just any caravan.”\n\n\"The...what?\" I manage to choke out, my voice shaky.\n\n\"Named after Griznak the Ghastly, the chiefest of chiefs, it's a gathering of the biggest, meanest, and dirtiest goblin tribes from all corners of the continent.\" His words echo in my ears, painting a terrifying picture of what I'm about to face.\n\nHis claws drum against my thigh as he chuckles, the sound causing a shudder to pass through my body. “It’s the biggest party ye’ll ever see,” he says, \"Goblins betting on bloody fights, drunk on rotgut brew and reveling in debauchery. Tis beautiful.”\n\nI swallow hard at the thought, but he doesn't stop.\n\n\"The slave fights are a spectacle to behold, lass,\" he says, his voice tinged with excitement. \"We pit our slaves against each other, to fight for our amusement.”\n\n\"Fight?\" I gasp out, my heart pounding in my chest. The idea of having to fight someone else for entertainment is abhorrent, let alone the thought of being Snib's betting tokens, against a sea of other vile goblins.\n\n\"Oh, don't ye worry, cowtits,\" Snib cackles, patting my thigh reassuringly. His laughter vibrates through me, increasing my discomfort. \"It’s mostly hand-to-hand. No weapons. Weeel. Sometimes wooden sticks. Ain't no fun if a slave dies too quickly. We bet on how long they can last.\" His voice holds a horrifying glee that chills me to my core.\n\n\"I...\" I trail off, at a loss for words. I can hardly fathom the extent of the brutality he is describing. The world I once knew as Aldric, filled with honor and valor, is disintegrating, leaving behind the twisted, perverse reality of my new life.\n\nHis hand leaves my thigh, slipping under my metallic bikini top again, and he squeezes my breast. “Look at ya, all dolled up in this fancy armor, barely able to swing a sword. They'd bet against ya in a heartbeat. But that's where they'd be wrong. That’s why we’re gonna be rich!\"\n\nSnib's words hammer into me like a punch to the gut, the realization of what he's suggesting sinking in.\n\n\"If ye can’t handle dungeons, this is the best way to make some coin. How much you got left to pay me off - was it, nine thousand, seven hundred gold? That’s a lot.”\n\nHe laughs again, his hand returning to my thigh as he talks about the goblin caravan, painting an increasingly grim picture. The Griznak Gobboree, a gathering of goblins, of violence, and debauchery. I'm to be part of it, a spectacle for Snib's amusement and profit. The thought fills me with dread, but also a spark of defiance.\n\nSnib's gnarled hand continues to grope and prod at my breast, his nails scratching against the metallic bikini top. His grip is uncomfortably tight, his fingers digging into my soft, vulnerable flesh. He seems to relish in the squishiness of my voluptuous breasts, his claws kneading and squeezing. His grip is hot and sticky, the dampness of his palm pressing against the sensitive skin, the stench of his smegma tainting the air around us. He's just violated me a few minutes ago, his musk still clings to my body, making me shudder.\n\n\"Ye should see 'em, Elise, all dem gobbos at the Gobboree,\" Snib murmurs, his voice barely above a gruff whisper. His hot, fetid breath rolls over the nape of my neck, causing my skin to crawl. \"Ye've got the perfect body for 'em. All soft an' ripe, with yer fat tits and fat ass.\"\n\nI feel a sickly blush creep up my cheeks at his crude words. His hand leaves my breast to drift lower, coming to rest on the curve of my hip. I squirm at his touch, the pressure of his hand against my side igniting a bitter taste of humiliation on my tongue.\n\n\"They love a good, thick woman, see?\" Snib continues, his voice full of glee. \"The hourglass shape, the way ye sway when ye walk. Drives 'em mad, it does. Especially them tits, they're like a pair of ripe melons. All the gobbos go crazy for a set of udders like yers.\" His hand kneads my hip, a lewd squeeze that makes me whimper. \"Can't wait to show ye off to my cousins, they're gonna lose their minds over ye.\"\n\nHis excitement is palpable, his words seething with anticipation. It's enough to make me sick, the thought of being paraded around like a piece of meat for goblin amusement. My body is burning with a wave of embarrassment, the very thought of Snib's disgusting, wart-covered cousins ogling me making my stomach churn.\n\n\"But don't ye worry, cowtits,\" Snib drawls out, his hand leaving my hip to grab a handful of my buttocks. The sudden intrusion forces a yelp out of my lips. \"I ain't gonna let any of 'em fuck ye. No, no. That's gonna be MY privilege.\"\n\nHis words are a punch to my gut. My heart stutters in my chest. The thought of Snib - or any goblin for that matter - violating me like that... I push the thought away, focusing instead on the uncomfortable sensation of Snib's hand kneading my behind, his fingers pressing into the pliant flesh through the skimpy metal bikini bottom.\n\n\"Ye’ll come around, Elise,\" Snib says, a note of confidence in his voice. \"Ye’ll be begging me for it soon enough.\"\n\nA chill runs down my spine at his words, at the sheer certainty in his voice. But I refuse to let him see my fear. I refuse to give him the satisfaction of knowing how much his words affect me. Instead, I focus on the steady rhythm of Jarkrond’s galloping hooves, the scorching desert wind that whips past us.\n\n[Choice: Arrive at the Griznak Gobboree.",

      "text": "As we approach, the Gobboree materializes on the horizon like a twisted mirage - a collection of mismatched tents of various shapes and sizes, arrayed haphazardly. I can see flickering flames dancing against the evening sky, while a cacophony of noise - discordant music, crude laughter, high-pitched squeals - wafts towards us on the desert breeze. Snib chuckles next to me, a perverse sense of satisfaction in his voice as he says, \"Welcome to the Gobboree, cow tits.\"\n\nEntering the heart of the Gobboree, it’s a fever dream of goblin debauchery and vibrant chaos. Fires crackle amidst tents dyed in every shade imaginable, as goblins of varying sizes and grotesqueness congregate in raucous revelry. Some squat and warty, others tall and wiry, but all bear the characteristic goblin lewdness. Their lusty, grating laughter echoes across the makeshift fairground. It's a melting pot of tribes, the diversity surprising me. Snib points out various tribes – the Thornbacks with their spiny protrusions, and the Foulmouths with their grotesquely large jaws. I can barely contain my revulsion, yet there's a morbid curiosity in me.\n\nAmidst the festivities, human slave-girls move around. Some are visibly pregnant, their swollen bellies a testament to the goblins' lustful endeavors. One scene in particular catches my attention - a beautiful blonde-haired woman, on all fours, being taken turns by a group of goblins. Their sizable members, not quite as large as Snib's but still formidable, pound into her with frenzied eagerness.\n\nOne goblin, smaller than the others, clumsily mounts her from behind. His bony hips thrust, accompanied by wet squelching sounds and a chorus of depraved cheers. With a grunt, he unloads himself deep inside her, a filthy chuckle escaping his lips. The woman whimpers, a mix of pain and pleasure marring her features. To my horror, my own body responds with a familiar tingle of arousal. Snib's chuckle next to me sends a shiver down my spine. \"Another one soon to be ripe with a goblin spawn, eh, cumdump?\" he grunts, amusement dancing in his beady eyes.\n\nServing women, beautiful and flushed, move amidst the frenzied goblins, offering platters of raw meat and overflowing mugs of some frothy brew. My heart aches at the sight of them, their once-cherished freedoms stripped away. Likely missing women from various human villages, now reduced to servitude.\n\nThe scene is a grotesque spectacle of primal urges. Goblins mate openly, their perverse enjoyment on full display, human women subjected to their lusts. It's a tableau of debauchery, a twisted tapestry of flesh, desire, and conquest.\n\nDespite the disgust clawing at me, I am forced to confront the chilling reality - this perverse carnival, this Gobboree, is a glaring testament to goblin society's disturbing hierarchy. A place where their base desires are not just condoned but celebrated. The air hangs heavy with the scent of sex, earthy and pungent, overpowering the smell of roasted meats and ale. The underlying musk of goblin arousal seeping into my senses, making my body respond with an unwilling flush.\n\nA part of me wants to look away, to deny the horrific reality before me. Yet, I can't. My wide-eyed horror is mirrored by a captivated fascination, a nightmarish truth I have no choice but to accept. I am Elise, once Aldric the Great, now a mere plaything in this goblin den of debauchery.\n\nThe stench of hot musk and flesh is inescapable. I can taste it, coppery and obscene on my tongue. A labyrinth of tents stretches out before us, pulsating with a sickening, carnal energy. The lustful cries of women and the savage grunts of goblins merge into a relentless cacophony. I feel my cheeks warm with the color of shame, my stomach churns with a sense of despair.\n\nAs Snib guides Jarkrond deeper into the carnival, I catch sight of a fighting pit. Here, slaves, both human and otherwise, are forced to brawl for goblin amusement. A massive, muscular orc, probably twice my size, has a human woman pinned down. She struggles beneath him, terrified and outmatched. Despite her impending defeat, the goblins around the pit cheer, throwing coin into a growing pile. The smell of sweat, blood, and fear fills the air as the orc's fists pummel the woman into unconsciousness. Instead of killing her, she is dragged out of the pit - unconscious and battered, but still a valuable piece of breeding stock.\n\nTurning away from the pit, I see a group of goblins gathered around a collection of slave women. The women are on their hands and knees, their bodies visibly shaking under the effort to stay upright as they serve drinks to the raucous goblins. Some of them are interrupted mid-service, goblins gripping their hips and thrusting themselves inside. Moans and cries of pleasure mix with laughter and cheers.\n\nBeside a large bonfire, a young woman, a blonde beauty likely stolen from some remote village, is pinned under a goblin. Her eyes are glassy and unfocused, her cheeks flushed. Her bare legs are hoisted in the air, her body rocking rhythmically with each of the goblin's thrusts. Even from here, I can hear the obscene squelching sounds. She whimpers, gasps, her body betraying her mind's horror with undeniable pleasure.\n\nNearby, a woman, her belly swollen with pregnancy, serves goblets of wine to a group of chattering goblins. Her body is adorned with nothing more than a transparent, gauzy fabric. It does little to hide her engorged breasts and rounded stomach. The goblins grope her without thought, their rough hands trailing over her body with possessive familiarity. Despite the ongoing violation, the woman maintains a stoic calm, her eyes glazed over in resigned acceptance.\n\nA pair of twins, indistinguishable except for the color of their hair, one brunette, the other blonde, are servicing two goblins simultaneously. Their identical faces twist in pleasure, their cries harmonizing in a lewd chorus. I see the goblins' muscled backs tense as they climax, their bodies shuddering, their cum spurting onto the twins' faces and chests. The sight is repulsively fascinating, my eyes drawn to it even as my stomach revolts.\n\nI see a brunette being claimed by a goblin on her hands and knees. He's small, even by goblin standards, but he mounts her with an animalistic fervor that makes my skin crawl. His tiny frame bounces with each thrust, his grunts echoing around the firelit space.\n\nThe most shocking sight is yet to come. As we draw closer to the heart of the carnival, I see a sight that will haunt my dreams. An array of women, dozens of them, all on their backs, legs splayed wide. Above them, goblins move in a grotesque rhythm, their bodies slick with sweat and other fluids. The women moan and whimper, their bodies writhing in a twisted dance of pleasure and degradation. The ground around them is slick with spent cum, the smell so pungent it makes my eyes water. The goblins move from woman to woman, their virility seemingly unending. Some women bear the roundness of pregnancy, others are still marked by the goblins' seed.\n\nAs we pass the revolting spectacle, Snib chuckles, his voice a nauseating purr in my ear. \"Ain't nothing like a good ol' Gobboree, eh slut?” His laughter reverberates through the night, a mocking echo to my despair.\n\nAs we press deeper into the sprawling network of tents, the orgiastic revelry of the open grounds gradually gives way to a more intimate, yet no less obscene, series of encounters. The shadows cast on the tent walls become private performances in their own right. Goblins and their human chattel, engrossed in acts of primal dominance that send shivers up my spine.\n\nThe first tent to our left houses a sight that almost makes me fall from the horse. Through a poorly drawn flap, I see a woman, high-born from her refined features and the remnants of a fine silk dress. Her hands claw at the dirt floor, her body shaking under the assault of not one, but three goblins. Despite her initial protests, her words have since turned into incoherent moans and whimpers. Her hips undulate in rhythm with the thrusts, her body arched back in a bow of surrender. \"Pl-please... my family... they have money... they'll...\" Her sentence is cut short by a loud, guttural cry as one of the goblins goes balls deep inside her. The obscene squelching of his climax echoes through the tent, followed by a rivulet of thick, milky cum spurting from her pussy. She gasps, her eyes rolling back, her body convulsing in what looks like a simultaneous orgasm. Her words turn into drooling moans, her body shuddering beneath the relentless assault.\n\nNext, we pass a tent with a dark-skinned woman, likely from the southern regions of Zaelasia. Her lithe form is bent over a low stool, her voluptuous ass in the air and thick thighs spread wide. A particularly large goblin, dwarfing his brethren, looms over her, his hands sinking into the soft flesh of her jiggling buttocks. His thrusts are powerful, causing her body to ripple with each stroke. I hear her whimpering, her hands clutching at the edge of the stool, her face buried into a pillow. Suddenly, the goblin's grunts turn into a roar. I see his cock twitch, then erupt, sending a cascade of thick, creamy cum onto her dark skin, contrasting obscenely against her. His pleasure is so potent it splatters up onto her back, over her shoulders, even reaching her curly black hair.\n\nThe final vignette is one I cannot see, but it echoes in my ears with haunting clarity. It's a shadow on a canvas, two bodies writhing against each other. The woman's moans sound so innocent, and yet the depth of her pleasure is unmistakable.\n\nWith each passing tent, each torrid scene of dominance and submission, I feel a knot of discomfort twisting in my stomach. Shame, fear, horror, and yet... underneath it all, a heat I cannot deny. It's a perverse reaction to such a spectacle, but it's there nonetheless, a flush of arousal that has my cheeks hot and my breath hitching.\n\nSnib, oblivious to my internal turmoil, leads me towards a larger, more elaborate tent. His rough voice breaks through the cacophony of moans and grunts as he haggles with a fellow goblin. I can only assume it's the tent-master. Meanwhile, the drums continue to pound in the distance, the rhythm syncopated with the grunts and moans that fill the air, a lewd symphony of decadence and debauchery.\n\nThe images of the women being used in such a grotesque manner are seared into my mind. Women from all walks of life, reduced to nothing more than sex slaves for these goblins. The sight of their bodies, their surrender, their pleasure... it's more than just shocking, it's heart-wrenching. But at the same time, it's frighteningly fascinating, the animalistic dominance striking some primal chord within me. It's a feeling of powerlessness, of overwhelming despair... and an undeniable, shaming arousal.\n\n[Choice: You'd better take your moonshade!",

Big melons, a jigglin' rump, 'n soft as a nargle's belly, she is,\" Snib brags, grinning through his grotesque, yellowed teeth.\n\nHe makes me bend over, exposing my barely covered posterior to the leering tent-master. The tent-master grunts.\n\n\"'Ere for the pits, she is. Not much of a fighter, this one. She'll make for a quick round, she will. But good show,” Snib cackles, his words laced with a disturbing sense of pleasure. The tent-master grunts in agreement, producing a bracelet from a leather pouch. It's a simple bronze band, but a series of unfamiliar, crude symbols etched into it tells me it's more than just an ornament.\n\nHe locks it around my arm. \"Gonna get a lotta bets on this one,\" he grumbles, his voice raspy. \"Pits love a bit of beauty 'n blood. Gets 'em roarin', gets the coin flowin'. Startin' tomorrow, she is.\"\n\nSnib's putrid laugh echoes in the air, and I swallow a bitter lump in my throat, steeling myself for the battles ahead.\n\nWe're shown to a spacious tent, by goblin standards at least. It’s lined with luxurious looking - for goblins - furs and hides of various beasts, dyed in deep shades of crimson and green. The scent of wet earth and decaying leaves fills my nostrils as we step inside. My eyes flicker around.\n\n\"But there's only one bed,\" I point out, glancing at Snib with a mix of apprehension and disbelief.\n\nHe simply grins, his eyes gleaming in anticipation. \"That's right, bitch.

This feels like another one of his cruel games, a taunting jest to belittle me, to take me down another peg.\n\nHe leers at me, his jagged teeth visible under the dim, flickering firelight from the lantern hanging from the center pole of the tent. \"Tonight, you're restin' early. Tomorrow's your big day.\"\n\nI swallow hard, my hands instinctively coming up to clutch at the metal bikini that feels all the more inadequate now. It digs into my flesh uncomfortably, the cool metal contrasting starkly with the warmth of my skin.\n\n[Choice: Undress.",

It takes a few tries, the metal clinking loudly in the otherwise quiet tent. Finally, it gives way, the front of the bra dropping away.\n\nThe sudden freedom is a relief and a torment at once. The weight of my massive breasts immediately pulls them down, the full globes bouncing with a slap against my belly. I can feel my nipples stiffen against the cool air, my breasts jiggling gently with the motion. They feel achingly bare, vulnerable under Snib's voyeuristic gaze.\n\nIgnoring his coarse laughter, I reach for the high-waisted metal g-string. It digs into my thick hips, the tiny piece of metal all that's between my intimate area and his leering eyes. It takes more effort to undo the small buckle at the side, my fingers trembling with anxiety. The sound of it hitting the ground seems to echo in the tent, reverberating through my entire body.\n\nLast to go are the metal stiletto heel-boots. I unbuckle them slowly, sliding my feet out of their confines. My feet feel light, tingling from the sudden release of pressure. Standing naked, I clutch an animal fur to cover myself.\n\nSnib just chuckles, stretching out on the fur-covered bed as though it's the most natural thing in the world. \"You ain't got nothin' I haven't seen before, bitch,\" he remarks, grinning devilishly. “Quit actin’ so prissy.”\n\nThe bed, if it can even be called that, is piled high with various furs and hides. Some dyed deep crimson and others in garish greens. It's the height of goblin luxury, a far cry from the sparse straw pallet I'm used to.\n\nI climb into it, the furs tickling my bare skin. There's a certain richness to them that contradicts the foul goblin who's sharing it with me. Lying on my side, my breasts stack on top of each other, squashing under their weight. They jiggle as I try to find a comfortable position.\n\nThe sounds of the Griznak Gobboree fill the air, a cacophony of revelry, debauchery, and breeding.\n\n\"I won't let it happen,\" I murmur to myself, my resolve steeling as I glance at Snib. \"I won't become another one of your broodmothers.\"\n\nSnib just laughs, turning to face me. \"We'll see, cowtits. We’ll see.”\n\nMy chest rises and falls, heaving under the rhythm of my ragged breaths, my nipples rubbing against the rough fur. I'm hot, uncomfortably so, my skin slick with sweat that's beading between the valley of my breasts and trickling down the small of my back. The heat seems to seep into the marrow of my bones, stoking the simmering desire that's been stirring in the pit of my belly for the past few days.\n\nSnib's chuckle makes my skin crawl, but there's a shameful part of me that also shivers with perverse anticipation. I turn my head, green eyes darting towards him, taking in his repugnant grin. \"You could be like 'em,\" he says, gesturing vaguely to the outside of the tent. \"Cummin' their brains out on gobbo cocks.\"\n\nHis words are a punch in the gut, a humiliating reminder of what my body seems to be yearning for.\n\nIt's like a fever, an incessant itch, an alien impulse that keeps me on edge. I can feel the wetness pooling between my legs, the evidence of my betrayal clinging to my inner thighs, a constant, damning reminder of my body's traitorous desires.\n\nI close my eyes, trying to push down the feeling, but it's like trying to submerge a buoy underwater. My mind races, picturing the women outside in the other tents, their moans and cries of pleasure so clear over the raucous sounds of the Gobboree.\n\nI squirm on the bed, the furs scratching against my sensitive skin, exacerbating the sensations. It's a torture rack of desire and shame, each move, each breath, each pulse of my heart sending waves of hot, throbbing need coursing through my veins. My legs squeeze together, the muscles in my thighs tensing as I try to provide some sort of relief.\n\nI run my hands over my body, tracing the curve of my waist, my fingertips sinking into the flesh of my hips, the generous swell of my ass. It feels foreign, alien, yet undeniably mine. The black waves of my hair spill over my shoulders, a cascade of midnight silk that brushes against my bare breasts. The contact makes my nipples harden, a jolt of sensitivity that sends another pulse of yearning through me.\n\nI bring my hand to my mouth, biting down on my knuckle, trying to stifle the whimper that threatens to escape my lips. The taste of my own sweat on my lips is a cruel mockery, a reminder of the shameful, debasing arousal that's holding me captive.\n\nI hate it. I loathe it. But at the same time, there's a primitive, insidious part of me that revels in it, that coils tighter and tighter with each second, like a spring waiting to be unleashed. I can't help but writhe, my hips arching, my belly undulating, the outline of my hourglass figure stark against the furs. It's like I'm a puppet, my strings pulled by the humiliating, maddening arousal that courses through my veins.\n\nMy mind's a battleground, caught between revulsion and need, denial and acceptance, defiance and submission. I want to resist, I need to resist. But my body, it yearns, it hungers. It feels primed, ripe, like an apple ready to be plucked from a tree. It feels... it feels fertile. The thought brings a fresh wave of shame crashing down on me.\n\nI try to ignore the lewd moans and grunts from the neighboring tents, the unsettling stench of sex and goblin musk thick in the air. The noise is a constant cacophony, the terrible soundtrack to my tormented arousal. My chest rises and falls heavily, my full breasts bobbing with the motion. The thin fur I use as a cover chafes against my tender nipples, the sensation sending further waves of discomfort through my already heated body.\n\nAs I lie here, my body aching, pulsing with unwanted heat, I close my eyes and turn inwards. The pounding rhythm of the goblin orgy, the smell of Snib's earthy virility, the sense of being on display in the dimly lit tent, I push it all away. Instead, I find the quiet corners of my mind where the murals of the Ephemerals are painted.\n\nI clutch the fur tighter, feeling the rough texture under my fingertips as the heat of my body seeps into the material, warming it. My heart pounds against my chest, the ache within me throbbing in time with it. Each pulse sends a flood of warmth down to my very core, a twisting knot of pleasure and shame coiling within me.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this visceral turmoil, I begin my prayer, whispering urgently, my voice drowned by the debauchery outside. I'm thankful for the noise, for it keeps my pleas hidden from Snib's ears.\n\n[Choice: Pray.",

He chuckles darkly, the sound dripping with vile satisfaction.\n\n“Need to cum, slut?” Snib grunts, his voice base and dripping with mockery. He shifts beside me, his massive, oozing cock brushing against my thigh, leaving a trail of hot, sticky precum.\n\nI shake my head, trying to deny the dark, twisted urge blossoming within me, but it’s overpowering, relentless. “I... I can’t... remember how to pray,” I admit in a desperate whisper. I don't know why I'm telling him!\n\nSnib’s laugh is cruel. “Then pray to the goblin gods, bitch. Pray to Storak's Path of Proliferation,” he commands.\n\nResisting feels like swimming against a riptide, the filthy haze of goblin seed pulling me under, drowning my resistance. With each beat of my pulse, I feel weaker, less like the hero I once was and more like the cum-addled plaything Snib wants me to be.\n\n“Repeat after me, you wretched whore,” Snib sneers, and begins to guide me through a debasing goblin prayer:\n\n“Mighty Storak, swollen and virile, let your seed spread wide and conquer the trembling flesh of the weak. I offer my body as your fertile ground, sow me with your prolific spawn.”\n\n“Glorious Grognar, grant me the strength to subdue and be subdued, to revel in the sanctity of the strong dominating the weak.”\n\nMy voice is a husky whisper, laced with a shame I can’t even begin to process. The heat between my legs grows unbearable, a twisted testament to the disgusting effectiveness of the prayer.\n\n“Sacred Grulkaz, divine mandate of reproduction, I embrace your command to breed and be bred, to multiply the legions of Storak’s brood with my lowly body.”\n\nAs I speak, Snib’s cock grows harder against my thigh, its heat searing, its smell - a heady mix of musk and smegma - filling my nostrils, reinforcing every vile word.\n\nWith a shuddering breath, I continue, “I pray to you, Skraggs, shamans of the seed, bless my womb with the potency of Storak’s loins, let it be fertile and yielding.”\n\nAt Snib’s nudging, my lips part, and his cock, thick and dripping with precum, finds its way into my mouth.\n\n[Choice: Suck his cock.]\"Eon, keeper of the past, cradle me in the wisdom of what once was. I am Aldric, I am Elise. Teach me to reconcile my identity, my self, my flesh with my spirit. Guide my remembrances so I may not lose myself in this nightmare.\"\n\nI feel my body, my unfamiliar curves and swells and the unbearable heat pooling within me, pressing against the rough fur. I wince at the thought, a small whimper escaping my lips.\n\n\"Flux, embodiment of the now, I am in the throes of your realm. I am shifting, changing, like water trying to find its shape. The curve of my hips, the weight of my breasts, the throbbing need within me, I acknowledge it as your influence. Help me find solace in this present, as tumultuous and painful as it is.\"\n\nI curl into myself, my body slick with sweat, a sheen visible on the swells of my chest. A rogue tear slips from the corner of my eye, trailing down my cheek and dampening the fur beneath.\n\n\"Verge, beacon of the future, I stand at the precipice of uncertainty. I look towards a tomorrow that is shrouded in a fog of fear and apprehension. Grant me the strength to believe in a transcendence, a future where I am more than a plaything, more than a body forced to succumb to primal urges.\"\n\nMy voice grows softer, the words tumbling out in a shaky whisper. I clutch at my belly, feeling the cramping sensation of my body's betrayal, the wetness between my legs a testimony of the torment I'm being put through.\n\n\"Triad of the Ephemerals, I ask for your guidance, your compassion. I am lost, tossed upon the tumultuous sea of change, my body alien, my mind a battlefield. Eon, Flux, Verge, help me navigate through this storm, help me find the courage to face the dawn.\"\n\n[Choice: Try to sleep.]",

A sense of tranquillity begins to seep in, pushing back the waves of torment. The throbbing, the heat, the shame - it all dulls into a distant murmur.\n\nI curl tighter into the fur, the coarse material providing a semblance of comfort against my bare skin. The noise outside continues its cruel serenade, but I feel a layer of detachment now, an armor of prayer shielding me. And so, against all odds, I find a sliver of peace.\n\nIn the symphony of the Gobboree, my heart finds its rhythm, lacing it with a quiet resilience. For in this night, in this cruel mockery of existence, I have whispered to the gods, to the universe, a plea born of despair and determination.\n\nAnd for the first time in a long time, I sleep - not a sleep of defeat, but a sleep of resistance, of hope for a dawn that carries the promise of change, the whisper of a better tomorrow.]Every inch of goblin-cock that slides between my lips sends a shudder of arousal through me, making it impossible to ignore the heat building between my own thighs.\n\nMy mind spins with filthy desire as I take him deeper, the salty taste of his smegma coating my tongue. It's vile, it's disgusting, yet I suckle him like it's the sweetest nectar, moaning around him like a lowly bitch. His precum oozes heavily, a thick, nasty precursor to the torrent I know is coming. I gulp it down greedily, each swallow pulling me deeper into degradation.\n\n\"Good bitch, just like that... Drink it all...\" Snib grunts, his voice thick with anticipation.\n\nHungry, debased slurps echo around the dimly lit tent as I work over his cock, my saliva mingling with his filthy secretions to create a slick, obscene mess. My breasts hang heavily, jiggling with each forceful bob of my head, the nipples painfully hard and sensitive.\n\nSnib reaches for them, his gnarled fingers tweaking and rolling the stiff peaks, sending bolts of unwanted pleasure shooting through me. I moan helplessly, the vibrations around his cock making him even harder.\n\n\"You ready for your night-night nectar, cumslut?\" Snib leers, his hand tightening in my hair, pulling me down until my lips are flush against his heaving groin.\n\nHis cockhead swells, and with a filthy grunt, he thrusts upwards, his cock flexing powerfully as the first heavy jet of cum shoots out. It's thick, clotted in its consistency, a vile, off-white slime that coats my throat, sticking to every surface it touches.\n\nBLURRT!!!\n\nThe taste is overpowering, sickeningly sweet yet somehow acrid, like spoiled milk mixed with bleach. My collar loosens, as if permitting me to take him deeper, swallow more greedily.\n\n\"Gulp it down, bitch. Let it fill you up,\" Snib commands, his voice now a raspy growl.\n\nUnable to resist, I obey, my tongue working desperately around his pulsing piss-slit, lapping up every drop of his repulsive seed. The thick ropes keep coming, each one hitting my stomach like a physical blow, filling me with warmth, with shame, with pleasure.\n\nThe flood of cum triggers something inside me, and I feel an explosive orgasm building. My body betrays me horribly as I begin to tremble, mewling mindlessly around his cock, the words slipping out in a childish, debasing babble.\n\n\"More, pwease... more cummy-wummies...\" I whimper stupidly, completely lost in the degrading act, my mind fogging over as I drink directly from the source. That's when I should have realized how far gone my brain was.\n\nSnib’s laughter is ghoulish, echoing around us as he keeps pumping, his cock twitching violently with each spurt, filling me up until I can feel his cum sloshing inside, heavy and suffocating.\n\n“Drink it all, you filthy whore... there’s a good girl,\" Snib praises mockingly as another thick shot of his seed coats my throat.\n\nAs the waves of cum keep hitting my belly, my body convulses in a monstrous orgasm. My cunt squirts shamelessly, the arousal too much even in the grip of utter humiliation. My juices mix with the sweat and cum on my thighs, dripping onto the fur below in a disgraceful show of my degradation.\n\nThe sounds of wet, squelching pumps fill the tent, along with my stupid moaning. Snib grunts one last time, a final glob of cum oozing into my abused mouth, and I swallow reflexively, utterly defeated, utterly debased.\n\nThe world seems to spin around me, a dizzy, cum-drunk daze enveloping my senses. I fall limp against him, my cheeks smeared with his seed, breaths coming in shallow, ragged gasps.\n\n\"Such a good cum dumpster... Now sleep, whore,\" Snib coos, his voice dripping with contempt.\n\n(:\"Use sheer willpower to take a dose of Moonshade despite your mental state...\",3,\"You manage to force yourself take a dose of Moonshade!\")I don't have the strength or will to resist. My mind is too foggy, too filled with the afterglow of an orgasm and the sickening warmth of his cum in my belly. In this degraded, filthy state, I drift off into a troubled sleep, a broken doll in the grip of a goblin's cruel pleasure.\n\n[Choice: The next morning...",

My eyes flutter open, and a sickening wave of warmth washes over me as I realize the position I’m in. My body is entwined grotesquely with Snib’s, my overly large, fat breasts resting heavy on his scaly chest, drool staining my chin.\n\nThere's an undeniable heat spreading through my body, an alarming sense of well-being from the close contact with the goblin’s nude form. His ugly, snoring mouth is mere inches from my face, his breath foul but strangely familiar now.\n\nThe realization that his hand is resting possessively on my butt, his gnarled fingers nestled into the soft flesh, sends another jolt of confused arousal through me. His naked cock, large and repulsive, lies draped heavily over my thigh, asserting its complete ownership of me.\n\nGoblin pheromones have completely infected your brain.[Choice: Try to snap out of it.]\n--- Chapter 8: The Warrior ---\nLight seeps into my eyes as I slowly awaken.\n\nLying next to me, Snib's repulsive goblin cock dribbles precum onto the furs, and I can't help but whimper in disgust. Quickly, I roll out of the bed, trying not to disturb his slumber. His musk, usually so overwhelming, is fainter in the early morning air. I reach for my bottle of Moonshade potion, knocking back a gulp as I brace myself for the day ahead.\n\n[Moonshade has prevented you from succumbing to goblin sperm...]After wiping my mouth with the back of my hand, I start the process of getting dressed. Bending over, I pick up my skimpy metal bikini armor from the floor, the cold metal a stark contrast against my warm, sweaty skin. My large breasts spill over the cups as I adjust the armor, the chain digging into my soft flesh. It's a struggle to get it over my chest, the armor clattering against my ribs. The bottoms, a high-waisted metal thong, wedges uncomfortably between my plump ass cheeks, and the belt cinches tight around my narrow waist.\n\nNext come the tall stiletto boots, buckling tightly around my calves. They force me to stand on my toes, causing my hips to sway and my ass to stick out even more. It's demeaning, a mockery of my former armor, but it's all I have.\n\n[Choice: Go outside to practice.]",

      "text": "*It's wrong, all so wrong.*\n\nAs the room spins slightly, a horrifying mix of dread and affection floods my senses I know I have to get ready for the fight in the arena today, but my limbs feel heavy, my thoughts muddled by the pheromones.\n\nBreathing heavily, I reach down, intending to separate myself from Snib. My fingers, slightly trembling, wrap around his hefty cock to lift it off my leg. But at the touch, a surge of electric pleasure zaps through me, completely out of place. The cock throbs demandingly under my hand, spitting out a little wad of gooey precum across my arm.\n\nWithout thinking, I lift my arm, and a low, degraded moan escapes my lips as I lick the thick substance off my skin. The savory, musky flavor sends a rush of warmth to my already sodden pussy, and my body rejoices at the taste.\n\n[Choice: Service him mindlessly.]Stepping outside, I take a moment to breathe in the early morning air, trying to wash the taste of Snib's musk from my tongue. The Griznak Gobboree is a cacophony of sights and sounds, but in the early morning, it's a still sea of snoozing goblins, punctuated by the odd grunt or snore.\n\nIn the distance, a few goblins are still stirring, no doubt still drunk from last night's festivities. The smell of stale ale, sweat, and sex fills the air, making my stomach churn.\n\nI need to focus. There's a wooden training dummy out back, set up for the day's events. It's there that I find my temporary weapon, a hefty wooden sword made from blackroot, a dense and heavy wood, much different than my precious Whisperwind. It's heavy in my hands, the unfamiliar weight making me clumsier than I'm used to.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I square up against the dummy, trying to push all thoughts of my predicament from my mind. I need to adjust to this body, to this weapon, to this armor. Every swing of my sword sends a wave of jiggles through my tits, distracting and annoying. But there's no choice. I have to get used to it, have to become stronger, have to survive.\n\nWith every swing, every jab, every block, I feel a mix of determination and desperation. This isn't who I am, not who I want to be, but it's who I need to be. I am not Aldric the Great anymore, not the male hero of Eboncrest. I am Elise, the Goblin's Pet, forced into a curvaceous, humiliatingly voluptuous form.\n\nThe coarse sand beneath my high-heeled boots shifts and crunches with every movement I make. I focus on my footing, the unfamiliar tilt of my posture atop these ridiculous stilettos. I miss my flat boots, the kind that made my footing steady and agile during a fight. But now, I need to adapt to this new reality, this humiliating form of existence.\n\nI bring the wooden sword to bear, the solid weight of the yew-root familiar and comforting in my slender hands. My breasts press against the metal confines of the bikini top as I engage in a practice lunge. The sudden jiggling of my chest distracts me, but I steel myself, focusing my mind on the task at hand. I draw in a breath, feeling my lungs expand and the metal of my skimpy armor dig into my skin.\n\nAn old routine echoes in my mind from my days as Aldric - pivot, lunge, parry, strike. My hips are wider now, my center of gravity shifted. As I move, the high heels force me to engage my thigh muscles more than I'm used to. I can feel the strain on my calves as well, as they try to compensate for the awkward elevation. My balance feels precarious, like walking on the edge of a sword, but I persist.\n\nMy wide hips sway with each movement, making my practice swings appear more like a dance than a warrior's drill. But there's power in that sway, in the shift of my weight from one curvaceous thigh to the other. With each twist, each step, each pirouette I can feel my ass tense, my thighs strengthening their grip on the ground. My movements become fluid, a stream finding its way around rocks and obstacles. A strange sense of pride wells up within me, as I continue to move, to adapt.\n\nNow for the tricky part: evasion. As Aldric, I was an expert in dodging and weaving through enemy attacks. Now? It's hard to be nimble with these goddamned high-heeled boots. But I need to learn. The first few attempts are clumsy, the heel of my boot digging into the packed sand, causing me to stumble. I grit my teeth in frustration, but I do not surrender.\n\nWith each new attempt, I grow more accustomed to the lift and imbalance these heels provide. I experiment, seeing if it's easier to pivot on the balls of my feet or the heel. The balls of my feet provide more stability, but I can't discount the heel altogether. I'll have to mix the two, depending on my opponent's moves.\n\nI focus on my form - maintaining a firm grip on the wooden sword, keeping my breasts from shaking too much with each vigorous movement, and making my ass and thighs work to keep me upright on these heels. I can feel the sand grating against the metal soles of my boots, my ankles straining under the pressure.\n\nThe sound of snoring goblins and their unfortunate slaves recedes into the background as I lose myself in my regimen. I'm not Elise, the goblin's pet, in this moment. I'm Aldric, the legendary hero. I'm a warrior, preparing for battle, adjusting to my new form, my new reality. Today, I won't be a goblin's plaything; I'll be a fighter in the pits. I have to be. For myself, for Elara. The thought of her stokes the fire within me, urging me to push harder, to endure.\n\n[Choice: Keep practicing.]",

I need it,\" I breathe out stupidly, my mind a swirling vortex of forced cock-worship. My voice is husky, thick with need as my grip tightens around him.\n\nSnib stirs slightly, a grunt of satisfaction rumbling from his throat as he feels my small, warm hands on him. \"That's it, cow tits... Know yer place,\" he mumbles sleepily, a slow smile spreading across his face as he watches me lose myself to debasement.\n\nEncouraged by his words, my actions become even more disgraceful. I lean down, pressing my jiggling breasts against his thighs as I take the head of his cock into my mouth, sucking eagerly. The taste of his early morning precum is strong, sickeningly sweet and potent. I slurp noisily, greedily, letting the nasty, lewd sounds fill the tent.\n\n\"Ungnhh... Yesss, master's cock is so good...\" I mumble around him, drool trickling down my chin as I bob my head. My hands, driven by a filthy fervor, pump his length, each stroke a surrender to the base desires he's instilled in me.\n\nSnib chuckles, the sound degrading yet impossibly arousing. \"Get it nice and hard, slut.\"\n\nI gasp, choke, but keep going, driven by a mindless need to please him, to make him groan and grunt. My belly clenches with horrifying delight each time he hits the back of my throat, each vile thrust pushing me further from the dignified warrior I once was.\n\n[Choice: Keep sucking.]As the sun continues its upward climb, painting the vast expanse of the Griznak Gobboree in a wash of bright, scorching light, I continue to train. My body screams in protest, but I push through the discomfort. I have to get used to this body, this alien yet familiar form. I have to fight. And by the gods, I will.\n\nI start to transition from footwork to practicing my stances. My first move is to step into the basic guard stance, feet spread shoulder-width apart, one foot slightly forward, my sword extended towards an imaginary foe. But as I whip around to change direction, my long, black hair sweeps across my face, obscuring my vision. A curse escapes my lips. This was never a problem when I was Aldric.\n\nElara's lesson comes to mind. I halt my practice and stride over to the edge of the training area, where the rough canvas of a goblin tent flaps lazily in the morning breeze. With a quick, forceful tug, I tear off a long, thin strip of the coarse fabric. I collect my hair in a loose bunch at the nape of my neck, twist it around itself and secure it with the strip of cloth. It’s rough and nowhere near as elegant as Elara's delicate fingers could do, but it does its job. My hair stays off my face, providing me with an unobstructed view of my surroundings.\n\nI go back to the center of the practice area, my high heels sinking slightly into the packed sand as I return to my fighting stances. I feel a renewed sense of determination, my large breasts secure within my metal bikini top, my ass flexing in my tight, metal bikini bottoms.\n\nI take up the high guard stance next, my sword held aloft, ready to strike down. As a man, the strength of my shoulders and the breadth of my chest gave me an advantage. But as Elise, the center of my strength is lower, in my core, my hips. The sword feels heavy in my hands, but not unmanageable. I shift from the high guard to a side guard, my right hip thrust forward as I shift my weight onto my right leg.\n\nNow for the hanging guard, a defensive stance. I hold the sword high and to the side, ready to intercept a blow. With the increased weight of my chest, I have to engage my core more to maintain balance. The armor bites into my skin but I ignore the discomfort. The grandeur of the warrior I once was fuels me, guides me.\n\nI transition through the stances, adjusting for my wider hips and higher center of gravity. I practice swiftly changing my stances, experimenting with how the heels affect my stability. I move fluidly, my heavy chest bouncing slightly as I swing the sword. I ignore the stirring amongst the few waking goblins, their crude comments barely reaching my ears.\n\nThen, as I am mid-swing, I hear a familiar, repulsive voice. Snib. The goblin's nasally tone cuts through the air, lewd and derogatory remarks about my 'performance' leaving his lips. His words are like ice water, a jarring reminder of my predicament. But I don’t let it break me. Instead, it fans the flames of my determination. I have a match later today, and I need to be ready for whatever creature I may face in the pits, be it orc or human. For them, for Elara, and for myself, I cannot afford to fail.\n\nShifting into the half-shield stance, I watch as Snib lumbers toward me, his oversized feet kicking up sand with each step. I resist the urge to cringe at his approach, my lips curving into a practiced smile instead.\n\n[Choice: Ask about your first opponent.]",

I don't think of Elara, of the arena, of my past glory—only the shameful joy of being used, of being a plaything for this monstrous goblin's pleasure.\n\nAs Snib stirs fully awake, feeling the warm, wet embrace of my mouth around his pulsing, engorged cock, his dirty grin widens, and he grips my hair, pulling slightly as he begins to buck his hips forward, fucking my face with increasing fervor. Each thrust pushes him deeper, making me gag, but the humiliation only fuels the disgraceful arousal burning within me.\n\n“Who do you belong to, slut?” Snib growls, his voice laced with a grotesque delight.\n\n“Y-you, Master! I belong to you,” I slur out, my words muffled by his meaty cock still lodged in my mouth. My mind reels with disgust and a sickening pleasure, the defiled echoes of my former self shrinking further into oblivion.\n\nSnib’s foul chuckle vibrates through his body, adding a nasty quiver to each thrust. “And what about your precious wife? What does she think about her hero now?”\n\nThick saliva and precum drip from my lips as I'm forced to respond, the perverse arousal making me dizzy. “She'd... she'd hate this...” I confess in a debauched moan, “but I c-can’t stop... So good... so wrong!”\n\n\"Snibby's cum finally got to ya! A bit pathetic. Thought ye'd last longer - no fun!\" Snib barks out a mocking, triumphant laugh. \"You're nothing but a gobbo fucktoy now. This is where you belong, isn't it? On your knees, choking on goblin cock!\"\n\nA surge of degraded pleasure races through me at his words, my pussy clenching, almost painfully invigorated by the foul truth of his declarations. My cheeks burn with a hot flush of shame mixed with depravity; it feels like every filthy syllable he utters brands me deeper as what I've become.\n\n“Are you ready for your gobbo load, cumslut?” His breath is ragged, his grip in my hair tightening as his thrusts grow uneven with the approach of his climax.\n\n“Uh huh... p-please, Master...” I whimper eagerly, nodding my head, lost in the filthy necessity of my degradation.\n\nWith a filthy grin, Snib abruptly pulls his throbbing cock from my mouth, positioning it instead atop my head. “Wouldn’t want you too woozy to fight,” he jeers, his swollen member twitching ominously as he lines it up with my raven hair.\n\n“Nooo, feed me, Master! Please!” I squeal, desperate for the degrading warmth of his release. But Snib only sneers, holding my head firmly as his hips jerk forward.\n\nHis cock flexes grotesquely, and then hot, heavy ropes of his rank cum shoot out, splattering across my hair.\n\nThe thick, vile fluid is scalding against my scalp...\n\nEach pulse of his cock embeds more of his disgusting seed into my once-beautiful black hair. The strands clump together, the warmth of his cum seeping into my skin.\n\nThe utter debasement of being used as nothing more than a cum rag for a putrid little monster sends me over the edge. I scream out, senseless babble pouring from my lips as my body convulses in the most stupid, mindless orgasm.\n\nMy pussy squirts, spraying all around me.\n\n“Mmmm, good bitch,” Snib croons, watching with depraved satisfaction as I cum my brains out beneath him. My body shudders and twitches, my mind short-circuited by the overwhelming rush of humiliation and forbidden pleasure.\n\nAs his cum drips down my forehead, cooling on my skin, I remain sprawled pathetically beneath him, a puddle of my own making pooling around my knees. Aldric is gone, consumed by this monstrous lust, by the foul enchantment of a goblin's debasement. All that remains is Elise, the gobbo's pet, her brain fogged and her body forever craving the degrade and defile.\n\n[Choice: Time to head to the arena...]\"Master,\" I begin, my voice steady, \"Do you know who my first opponent will be?\"\n\nA look of amusement flickers in his beady eyes, the corners of his mouth stretching into a lewd grin.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to know, pet?\" he snarls, a gloating chuckle reverberating through the air. \"It's a surprise.\" I watch as his gnarled hand wraps around his engorged cock, stroking it as his gaze roams over my scantily clad body.\n\nAs revulsion bubbles within me, I force myself to remain calm, to ignore his vulgar display. I return my attention to the training dummy, continuing my practice as I mull over my possible opponents.\n\nOrcs are typically large and aggressive, often overpowering their opponents with sheer strength and size. I remember the scene from last night, the sight of that giant orc pinning a girl down, her pleas for mercy echoing in the night. I refuse to share the same fate.\n\nWith them, agility and speed would be my allies. My footwork would need to be impeccable, each step purposeful, and my strikes, precise. I would need to stay out of their reach, utilizing my lighter wooden sword to chip away at them. Bashing them in the head, the knees, the groin - any weak point exposed in their armor.\n\nHumans, on the other hand, would be a different challenge. Some might be slaves like me, some could be former warriors, cunning and skilled. In these bouts, outsmarting my opponent would be the key. I'd have to remember to feint, to deceive, to always stay one step ahead.\n\nMy sword arcs through the air as I transition to the ox stance, my thighs flexing under the strain. I can feel my body adapting to the movements, my hips accommodating the high heels, the weight of my chest no longer pulling me off balance.\n\n[Choice: Snib leads you to the arena.]",

I can only hope that I will be ready when the time comes.\n\nOnce inside the pit-master’s tent, a gruff goblin pit master hunches over a large table strewn with scrolls and coins. He hardly spares me a glance as we enter, his attention fully on Snib. I can hear the crowd outside, the roar of anticipation growing as goblins filter into the sand arena. The clasp of my slave bracelet against my arm feels heavier than ever.\n\n\"Snib,\" the pit master grunts, pointing at a scroll. \"Your pet's match is against the Wailing Widow. Won five matches so far.\"\n\nThe Wailing Widow? I blink, trying to make sense of the nickname. The pit master chuckles, leaning back to give a more detailed description.\n\n\"She was a warrior from the Northern Reaches, captured in battle. Gave our lads a hell of a fight, killed a dozen before they subdued her. Fierce as they come, didn't take to breeding. Broke a gobbo's cock the first night, so we threw her in the pits instead.\"\n\nHe laughs at the memory, his beady eyes flicking to me for a moment, assessing my tits as if they were prize melons. My stomach churns at his gaze, a nauseating mix of disgust and fear churning within me.\n\n\"Your tit-bitch won't last a minute,\" he smirks, turning back to Snib. \"The odds are ten to one. But don't worry, even if she loses, you'll get your 150 gold.\"\n\nThe name hits me like a slap to the face. Tit-Bitch. The goblins' laughter rings in my ears, my cheeks flushing with shame. Snib cackles with delight, his rough hand reaching out to give my right breast a jostle. The cold metal of my armor bites into my flesh, a sharp reminder of the reality of my situation.\n\nI swallow hard, forcing down the lump in my throat. \"What does she fight with?\" I find myself asking, my voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe pit master's laugh is a low, mocking rumble. \"She fights with a spear, Tit-Bitch. Now shut your trap, the adults are talking.\"\n\nHis dismissive tone stings, my mouth going dry as I fall silent. I am not Aldric the Great here. I am just a Tit-Bitch, a spectacle to these beasts. But as the pit master and Snib continue their conversation, ignoring me entirely, a spark of determination ignites within me.\n\nI am more than just a pair of tits. They underestimate me. And I will prove them wrong. I have to.\n\n[Choice: Fight!",

The Griznak Gobboree pit is a crude circle of piled rocks, with ragtag wooden stands set up around it. Goblins fill the seats, their eager eyes drinking in the spectacle below. I can feel their leering stares, hear their crude laughter, taste their anticipation in the dry, dusty air.\n\n\"Introducing our first fighters of the day!\" A goblin announcer shouts, his voice scratchy but loud, amplified by some magical means. \"In this corner, we have the dreaded Wailing Widow!\"\n\nA murmur runs through the crowd as a woman strides into the pit. Tall, muscular, her gaze as hard as steel. She twirls a wooden spear in her hand, the point glinting ominously in the early morning light. Her eyes meet mine for a brief moment. I see a flicker of humanity there, buried deep beneath layers of survival.\n\n\"And in this corner,\" the announcer continues, his grin growing wider, \"we have our fresh meat, the lovely Tit-Bitch!\"\n\nA mix of laughter and cheers fills the air as I shift uncomfortably, the straps of my bikini armor digging into my skin. I grip the hilt of my blackroot sword, the wood reassuringly solid in my hand. She has reach with her spear, but I have maneuverability, flexibility. If I can get in close...)\n\n*I probably should have been practicing though...*\n\n\"I'll make this quick, Tit-Bitch,\" the Wailing Widow says, her voice rough and gritty. \"Ya look more like breeding stock than a fighter to me.\"\n\n[[Choice: Attack!][[Choice: Lull her into false sense of security.]",

There is goblin cum still caked in my hair.\n\n\"Come on then, show us what you've got, Tit-Bitch!\" one of the goblins howls, sending a ripple of laughter through the stands.\n\nGritting my teeth, I lunge forward, my wooden sword slashing through the air towards the Widow. My move is basic, something a novice might attempt, and it’s embarrassingly telegraphed. She sidesteps with a scoff, her spear’s shaft blocking my clumsy attack with ease.\n\n“Is that it?” she taunts, her voice dripping with disdain.\n\nPanic gnaws at my insides as I retreat, trying to muster whatever remnants of training I can recall. But it’s like wading through molasses; every move is slower, every decision second-guessed.\n\nI feint to the left and swing desperately to the right, hoping to catch her off guard. But it’s no use. The Wailing Widow is a blur of motion, her responses not just effective but cruelly efficient. Her spear finds the gaps in my shoddy armor, prodding at the exposed flesh with painful jabs.\n\nA sharp sting blooms across my thigh. Blood trickles down my leg, stark against my pale skin. With the crowd's roars crescendoing, a dreadful realization sets in:\n\nI'm not just outclassed, I'm in real danger.\n\nDriven by fear, I lunge forward, hoping to close the distance. This is it, my last chance. I put everything into a ferocious overhead strike, my muscles burning with the effort.\n\nThe air whistles as my wooden sword arcs downward... only to meet empty sand. The Widow has moved—she sidesteps with a dancer's grace, her expression one of cold anticipation. As I flounder off-balance, she strikes.\n\nLooking up, with my vision blurring and heart pounding in defeat, I see the Widow towering over me. Her eyes hold not anger, but a weary pity as she withdraws her spear with a sickening squelch.\n\nThe crowd's cheers are distant now, muffled by the throbbing in my ears. \"Pathetic,\" the Widow mutters, turning away to acknowledge her victory.\n\nOn my knees, the world tilts and spins. The taste of blood and sand mixes in my mouth, a bitter cocktail of failure and despair. I’ve lost. Not just the fight, but myself. I sink into the sand, a broken, bloody heap, my gaze fixated on the slowly darkening sky above as consciousness begins to slip away.\n\nA single, silent question haunts my dwindling awareness: *What have I become?*\n\nThe arena fades, the jeers and roars of the crowd dimming into nothingness as darkness claims me, leaving only the cold embrace of the sand and the echoing shame of my defeat.\n\n(:\"07 bj\",7,\"Goblin cum eroded your combat abilities, since you didn't take your Moonshade.\")]I bite back a retort, instead offering a shy smile. Let her underestimate me. Let them all underestimate me. I step back, lifting my sword in what I hope looks like a dainty stance. The crowd erupts in laughter. I ignore them, focusing on the woman before me.\n\n\"Ready, fighters?\" the announcer calls out. \"Let the battle begin!\"\n\nAs the Wailing Widow's battle screech pierces the air, time seems to slow to a crawl. Her charge is a blur of motion, spear pointed straight at me. My heart hammers in my chest, my mind racing to anticipate her movements.\n\nShe lunges, and I sidestep just in time. The spear whistles past me, missing by a hair's breadth. I barely have time to react before she spins, her spear arcing toward me. I bring up my sword, blocking her blow. The impact rattles up my arm, a harsh reminder of the strength behind her attack.\n\n\"Ooh, and the Tit-Bitch barely avoids a skewering!\" The announcer's crude commentary reverberates around the arena, fueling the crowd's frenzied cheers.\n\nMy counterattack misses its mark, the Wailing Widow dancing out of my sword's reach with cat-like agility. I stumble back, the constriction of my metal bikini armor making my movements stiff and awkward. The weight of my chest strains against the cold metal, my breasts jiggling with each frantic movement, rubbing uncomfortably against my arms.\n\nI barely see her next attack coming. She feints to the left, then strikes right, the butt of her spear connecting with a stinging blow to my ass. I let out a yelp of surprise, my heels sinking into the sand as I topple backward.",

My mind races back to the early morning training, the dummy opponent in the quiet, empty pit. I summon the rhythm of my practiced movements, focusing on the shifting sand beneath my towering heels.]I grab a handful of the coarse, heated sand from the arena floor. With a swift motion, I throw it directly into her face.\n\nHer reaction is immediate and gratifying. The Wailing Widow stumbles back, her fierce eyes squinting as she attempts to clear the grit from her sight.\n\nSeizing the opportunity, I spring from the ground, sand clinging to my sweaty skin.\n\nI parry her next thrust, my sword meeting the shaft of her spear with a satisfying crack. My heart pounds with the adrenaline of the fight as I sidestep her second lunge, my wide hips swaying to the rhythm of the dance we weave in the sandy pit.\n\n\"Look at the Tit-Bitch move!\" the goblin announcer screams, his crude words fueling the rising excitement of the crowd. \"Is she fighting or dancing? Can't quite tell with those tits bouncing!\"\n\nI force a smirk, ignoring the vulgar commentary, turning my focus back to the fight. My sword connects again, knocking her third spear thrust aside. The Wailing Widow's eyes widen as she reels back, a flash of surprise breaking through her hardened demeanor.\n\nI'm keeping up. I'm managing to hold my own. But the Wailing Widow is not to be underestimated. She takes a step back, a glimmer of newfound respect in her eyes. She changes her stance, assuming a more defensive position, her spear held ready. The pace of the fight changes, the Wailing Widow's attacks calculated, more precise.\n\n\"Oh, maybe the Wailing Widow was too hasty!\" The announcer's voice rings out again, thick with anticipation. \"Tit-Bitch got some moves, huh?\"\n\n\"Would have been an equal fight,\" she taunts, a smug smile playing on her lips, \"if not for those ridiculous heels of yours.\" The crowd's laughter echoes around us, their jeers fueling my resolve. The fight is far from over, and I intend to give them a show they won't forget.\n\nJust as I begin to regain my footing, the Wailing Widow takes advantage of my precarious balance. She circles me like a predator, her spear outstretched, eyes analyzing my every move. With a swift lunge, she aims for my feet, not to injure, but to dislodge. A calculated strike hits the metal stiletto of my heel boot, sending me sprawling onto the sandy floor. My sword flies out of my grasp, clattering away into the distance.\n\n\"Stay down, Tit-Bitch!\" she snarls, pressing her boot firmly onto my chest, squeezing the air out of my lungs. The cold touch of metal from her boot digs into my exposed flesh, squashing my breasts beneath its weight. Her words are a venomous hiss. \"Look at you, flailing around in that obcene outfit. Maybe tonight, you'll finally find use for that body of yours. I bet you could nurse a litter of goblin whelps with those fuckin’ tits.”\n\nA wave of disgust rolls over me at her words. The crowd around us roars with laughter, the crude jeers of the goblins ringing in my ears, echoing her sentiment. My heart pounds with a mixture of fear and determination, my mind racing to find a way out of this predicament.\n\nAs the Wailing Widow lifts her spear for the final blow, I seize my moment. “I’m sorry you don’t like my heels,” I say, a reckless grin spreading on my face.\n\n[Choice: Use them!",

A swift twist of my heel and the spear is ripped from her hands, flying across the pit. I use the momentum to kick up my other leg, the hard metal boot connecting with the Wailing Widow's ribs with a satisfying thud. She stumbles backward, the air knocked out of her, her eyes wide with shock.\n\nThe crowd roars around us, the pit echoing with the crude goblin announcer's excited yells. \"Did you see that? The Tit-Bitch fights back!\" He hollers, excitement dripping from his words.\n\nBoth of us unarmed now, we circle each other once again, our breaths coming in ragged gasps. Hand-to-hand combat it is then. I shake off the sand clinging to my body, my eyes locked onto hers.\n\nFeet grounded, heart racing, I brace myself as the Wailing Widow lunges at me, her muscled body a blur of motion. She aims a heavy punch at my chest, but I sidestep, my slender body barely avoiding the hit. I return with a swift jab, my small fist colliding with her jaw. She stumbles, but recovers fast, her eyes alight with a fiery determination. The crowd roars, their excitement palpable.\n\n\"Looks like Tit-Bitch's got some fight left in her!\" The announcer's voice cuts through the noise, an edge of disbelief in his voice. I ignore him, focusing all my attention on the Widow.\n\nWith a swift turn, I aim a high kick at her side. She catches my foot mid-air, twisting me around. My body flies across the pit, sand getting in places it really shouldn't. I wince as I land, a sharp pain lancing through my ribs.\n\n\"And she goes flying! Poor Tit-Bitch doesn't stand a chance!\" The announcer crows, the goblins howling with laughter.\n\nI pull myself back onto my feet, my body feeling too light, too weak for this kind of physical combat. But I push through, calling upon my knowledge and instinct as a fighter. I block the Widow's next blow, using her momentum to guide her past me. She stumbles, the crowd erupting in a roar of disbelief.\n\n\"Well, that's a new one. Did Tit-Bitch just deflect the Widow's attack?\" The announcer sounds stunned, his words drowned out by the jeers and laughter of the crowd.\n\nMy eyes dart to the fallen spear, its wooden body taunting me from the sandy ground. I must get to it. A feigned punch distracts the Widow, and I use the moment to dart closer to the spear. But the Widow is quick to react. She slams her foot into my side, my body colliding with the sand, stars exploding in my vision.\n\n\"The Widow's not holding back now. One more hit like that, and Tit-Bitch's just another mound of sand,\" the announcer yells, his words a grim echo in my ears.\n\nPain throbs through me, my body no match for the Widow's muscled form. But I refuse to yield. Pulling myself up, I block her next attack, my arm colliding with hers. I manage to twist her around, her back to the spear. I can't let her reach it.\n\nMy heart pounds in my chest, each beat a throbbing echo in my ears. I wipe the sweat trickling into my eyes, a momentary respite as I assess the woman before me. The Wailing Widow smirks, her voice filled with scorn as she spits out a taunt.\n\n\"Better luck next time, Tit-Bitch.\"\n\nBut I see the weariness in her eyes, the same chains of servitude that bind us both.\n\n[Choice: But you won't lose!",

I look down at the fallen woman, a fellow pawn in the goblins' twisted games. My victory tastes bitter on my tongue, a hollow triumph against another victim of the goblins' cruelty.\n\nStill panting from the fight, I am escorted back to the pit master. He gapes at me, or rather, at Snib, unable to conceal his shock. But there is no praise for me, no acknowledgment of the skill and strategy that allowed me to prevail. I am just a pet, a novelty that exceeded expectations. Snib is the one who receives the respect, the admiration.\n\nA heavy sack of gold is slid across the table, the jingle of coins ringing in my ears. I watch as Snib hefts it up, the weight of it causing him to grunt. It must weigh as much as a small child, I think, a hefty sum indeed. The pit master mentions an additional prize in the next room, a sign of respect from the goblin leader, Grokk. A flicker of recognition crosses Snib's face as he bows, his rough voice murmuring words of gratitude in guttural goblin tongue.\n\nMy heart sinks as the pit master details Grokk's desire to have the Wailing Widow removed. Despite her attempts to demean me, I still felt a sense of camaraderie with the fallen warrior. We are both victims of the goblins, humans reduced to playthings in their cruel games.\n\nI follow Snib into the next room, my gaze taking in the decadence of the victor's pit. Velvet cushions are strewn around, the scent of exotic spices lingering in the air. Slaves with glazed eyes and swaying hips serve their goblin masters, their faces flushed with an unnatural rosy glow. The sight makes my stomach churn, the cruel manipulation of these women a stark reminder of my own situation.\n\nGrokk's gift is a slender young woman, her brown hair tumbling down to her waist. She blushes under Snib's lustful gaze, her green eyes glassy under the influence of the goblin pheromones.

The same is offered to me, along with a plate heaped with roasted meats and a strange mushy paste, a goblin delicacy no doubt. I nibble cautiously, my stomach rumbling in protest at the unfamiliar food. The slave girls watch me curiously, their eyes flickering with a glimmer of sympathy.\n\nMy side throbs relentlessly, a consistent echo of the fight, each breath turning the dull ache into a sharp stab of pain. The slave girls flit around me, their bodies moving with a grace they've perfected over time, their movements seeping sensuality.\n\nA petite girl with fiery red hair and freckles across her cheeks and shoulders, one that looks barely out of her teens, gently removes my metallic bikini top. It lifts off my breasts with a small suction sound, my G-cup breasts jiggling as they're freed. My nipples harden instantly at the cool air, before the slave girl's warm hand cups them.\n\nI cringe at her touch, waiting for the sharp stab of pain from the pressure, but it doesn't come. Instead, she applies a thick green paste to her fingers and rubs it around my nipples, her touch feather-light. The paste tingles as it makes contact with my skin, causing me to gasp. The sensation isn't painful, but a gentle warmth that spreads from my chest to the rest of my body.\n\nA shiver runs down my spine as her fingers glide over the swells of my breasts, massaging the paste into the soft, tender flesh. I watch her as she kneads my mounds, her small hands making my tits seem even larger in comparison. The tenderness in her touch is surprising, causing a flutter in my stomach.\n\nMeanwhile, a tall, muscular blonde woman, perhaps a warrior before her enslavement, applies a poultice to my ribs with delicate precision. The coarse texture of the concoction grates against my scraped skin, but the coolness of it soothes the sting.\n\nAnother girl, with dark, almond-shaped eyes and luscious brown curls, starts wrapping bandages around my scraped and bruised knees. I imagine she might have been a dancer, or perhaps a gymnast, her lithe body moving with an elegance that hints at her past life.\n\nA gentle hand tilts my head to the side, a girl with big, brown doe eyes, her curly hair cascading down her back, applies a soft, cool cloth to my bruised cheek. A soothing balm follows, its sweet, floral scent filling my nostrils as it's rubbed into my skin.\n\nMeanwhile, more slave girls surround Snib, their movements almost ceremonial as they attend to their grotesque master.\n\nThe 'gift' girl, a slender creature with delicate elfin features, kneels before him, her D-cup breasts hanging tantalizingly from her chest. Her hair, a halo of chestnut curls, falls around her flushed face as she looks up at Snib with reverence in her cloudy, lust-filled eyes.\n\n\"I am Liliana, Master,\" she coos in a soft, throaty voice, a flush spreading across her pale skin. \"A gift from Grokk.

Its length and girth are an obscene sight, veins pulsating beneath the skin. Hot, steaming pre-cum dribbles down its shaft, releasing a foul, musky scent that fills the room.\n\n\"Such a virile cock, Master,\" Liliana croons, her fingers gently tracing the throbbing veins along its length. \"Tit-Bitch,\" she says, glancing my way with an impish grin, \"could give you so many goblin pups.\"\n\nI feel a wave of nausea, the harsh truth making my head spin. I swallow hard, struggling to keep the bile down, but a strange heat stirs between my thighs.

She's relishing in the perverse sensations, her body writhing in anticipation.\n\n\"I...

There's nothing... nothing better than being pregnant with goblin pups. Feeling them grow inside me.\"\n\nMy heart sinks in my chest as I watch the scene unfold. \"Elara\" is completely lost in her world of lewd fantasies, worshipping Snib as if he's a god. She glorifies the goblin breed, placing them on a pedestal above her own species.\n\n\"And goblins... they're so manly, so dominant,\" she whispers, her words punctuated with moans as Snib continues his lewd massage of her cunt. \"Human men can't compare. Goblin and human women... it's the perfect relationship.\"\n\nMy heart beats painfully in my chest as she praises the goblins. My pussy pulses, and I grit my teeth against the building arousal. It's repugnant, this whole situation, but I can't ignore the heat gathering between my thighs.\n\n\"And then... then you feel them move.

I bite my lip, trying to hold back the tears of shame, despair, and a twisted sense of longing that I can't understand. The moans of \"Elara,\" the grunts of Snib, the slap of their bodies... it's horrible.\n\nAnd all I can do is watch, the heat of arousal a burning, shameful secret against my inner thighs.\n\nHis little goblin body moves with an unholy energy, his big cock disappearing into Liliana over and over.\n\nThen, suddenly, he thrusts all the way in, his balls slapping against her ass. He grunts, his face twisted in a grimace of pleasure. I see his cock bulging against her skin, his cockhead pressing into her from the inside.\n\n[Choice: He goes even deeper.",

The sounds of the gruesome act pierce through my flimsy barriers—each wet, sticky slap of Snib's grotesque thrusts are etched violently into my consciousness. Liliana's moans vibrate as muffled echoes behind my hands, each whimper and cry sharper than the last.\n\n\"S-so much... *please*...\" Her voice breaks. I flinch with each distinct thwack—the disgusting sound of viscous fluid mixing with fervent thrusts.\n\nThe room fills with Liliana's gasps escalating into cries of obscene rapture, \"It's filling me up... too much...!\" The bed creaks. My stomach churns as the air thickens, the smell of sex and goblin cum invasive, metallic, reaching me even here, where I stand repulsed and trembling.\n\nA resounding slap, wetter and deeper, followed by a guttural groan signals his release.\n\nI hear the sloppy, vulgar noise of him pulling out, the pop. Silence for a heartbeat, and then, Liliana's whimpering fills the void, a soft, helpless sound.\n\nMy eyes flutter open involuntarily, pulled by the morbid curiosity, the horror. Liliana lies sprawled, her belly distended unnaturally, a clear sheen of cum trickling down her thigh. Snib steps back, a smug leer plastered over his warty face as he surveys his work—her body violated, displayed, a vessel of his vile conquest.\n\nAround me, the slaves whisper, their tones mix of awe and desire, unsettling in their intensity. \"Look at her... she's been properly used...\"\n\nI stand frozen, the acidic burn of shame and unwanted arousal gnawing at my insides. The sight, the sounds, the sheer wrongness of it all sear into me, leaving a mark of indelible disgrace.]A shudder ripples through Liliana as the first rope of cum is unleashed inside her. The bulge in her lower belly pulses, the sign of Snib's obscene unload. Her body jolts, a gasping cry ripping from her throat. \"It's... it's so much,\" she whimpers.\n\nHis balls twitch, each spasm signaling another heavy, gelatinous spurt of goblin cum. The sensation is palpable, even from where I stand. His cock twitches within her, each twitch signaling a powerful surge of cum. It's like a twisted biological fireworks show, a sequence of obscene eruptions, each followed by Liliana's whimpering cries.\n\nThe other girls gasp, eyes wide and faces flushed. \"Look at her belly,\" one whispers, her finger pointed at Liliana. Her lower belly is slowly expanding, the skin stretching taut. I can see it, a slow, steady bulge that's growing with each passing second.\n\nA low, guttural laugh tears from Snib's lips, the sound full of obscene pleasure. His body shakes, his balls twitching as they continue to pump load after load of his hot, putrid goblin cum into Liliana's womb. His laughter sends a shiver down my spine, a cruel reminder of the utter domination he wields.\n\nLiliana's body convulses under the intense sensation. Her eyes roll back, her mouth opening in a silent scream. The sight of her, reduced to a drooling, twitching mess by the sheer force of Snib's cum, is enough to make my stomach churn. But I can't deny the heat growing between my own thighs, the way my own body responds to the obscene display.\n\nAs I watch, I see a dribble of white escaping from her. The sticky, bleachy smell of goblin cum fills the air. It's overwhelming, a sensory assault that makes me gag. But it's impossible to look away. The sight of her, leaking cum from her overstuffed womb, is burned into my brain.\n\nHis cock gives a final twitch, one last spurt of cum filling Liliana's womb. His laughter dies down, replaced by heavy panting. He pulls out, a string of cum connecting his cock to Liliana's pussy. The sight is obscene, a testament to his virile potency.\n\nLiliana's body slumps onto the cushions, a whimper escaping her lips. Her belly is round, distended with his cum. Her face is flushed, her eyes half-closed. \"I... I feel so full,\" she murmurs, a note of wonder in her voice.\n\nAround me, the slaves watch with rapt attention, their faces a mixture of envy and awe. They whisper among themselves, their words full of admiration for Snib's potency. I can't understand their fascination, their obsession with the obscene breeding spectacle. But I can't deny the perverse attraction, the twisted allure of the breeding spectacle.\n\nA slave girl next to me leans in, her whisper a hiss in my ear. \"Now you see,\" she murmurs, her eyes glued to Liliana's distended belly. \"Now you see what a real goblin can do.\"\n\nAs I watch Liliana's body slowly recovering from the breeding spectacle, I can't help but feel a perverse fascination. It's obscene, vile, a twisted violation of the natural order. But I can't deny the allure, the twisted attraction of the spectacle. The goblin's dominance, his virility, his utter control... it's a horrifying spectacle that I can't help but watch in awe.\n\n[Choice: They seal her pussy.",

They ease Liliana to her feet, their hands gentle and efficient as they slide the cloth up her legs, tugging it into place over her freshly filled pussy.\n\nThe cloth sticks to her, saturated with the remnants of Snib's obscene load. It clings to her skin, sealing her womb, ensuring the potent goblin cum is trapped inside. Their hands are clinical, detached, moving with a practiced ease that only comes with experience. It's a mundane act, a simple task, but its implications send a shiver down my spine.\n\nThey finish securing the garment and step back, their eyes lingering on Liliana's swollen belly. I watch her, the proof of Snib's virility clearly visible. Her hands drift down to her stomach, fingers pressing into the bulging flesh. A soft sigh slips from her lips, her eyelids fluttering.\n\nOnce they're done, they carefully guide Liliana towards the tent entrance. She stumbles, legs shaky from the breeding. They catch her, their hold steady as they guide her out of the tent, their soft murmurs filling the air as they assure her she did well.\n\nSnib grunts in satisfaction, a satisfied smirk on his lips as he watches her leave. The slaves return, this time carrying a new, more opulent loincloth. It's embroidered with intricate designs, a symbol of Snib's status and success. They present it to him, their heads bowed in respect.\n\n\"Thank you, Master Snib,\" they say in unison, their voices hushed, full of reverence. \"Thank you for granting Elara your seed.\"\n\nHe nods, a simple gesture of acknowledgment, before putting the loincloth to the side. He’s still nude.\n\nI stand there, more bandages than skin, the sensation of their touch still lingering. The slaves have done their job meticulously, wrapping up my scrapes and bruises, salving my aching muscles, providing a buffer against the pain that threatens to bloom anew. Despite the trauma of the day, my body feels oddly fortified.\n\nSnib, my goblin master, slouches back, a disgusting splay of green skin. His body is a stark contrast to my bandaged one, rough and dotted with warts, a crude testament of goblin physiology. His frame is covered in a sheen of sweat and his fat, foot-long cock dangles between his legs, flaccid and dribbling with remnants of his recent release.\n\nAn odious musk, a blend of sweat, semen, and virility, hangs in the air around him, saturating everything it touches. It's a pungent reminder of his breeding with Liliana, a horrid olfactory assault that sends my stomach churning and, to my utmost humiliation, a faint slickness pooling between my thighs.\n\nHis eyes roam over my bandaged form, the smirk on his lips widening as he takes in the sight. \"Ain't ya a sorry sight, tits,\" he says, his voice gruff.\n\nHis hand swings out, landing a firm slap on my ass. I wince at the contact, the sudden sting cutting through the numbing salve.\n\n\"Look at ya, all done up. Did ya have to go and get yerself all banged up?\" he continues, his gaze focused on the swathes of bandages that litter my body. “Yer worth more to me in one piece.\"\n\nHe chuckles, a grating, guttural sound that grates against my nerves. My gaze flicks to the door, where the slaves are waiting, their eyes sparkling as they watch Snib's display of dominance.\n\nSuddenly, one of them steps forward, her hands full of oils and cloths. \"It is your duty to bathe Master Snib,\" she says, her voice steady.",

I can't do this,\" I murmur weakly.\n\nThe slaves surrounding me gasp in unison, their eyes wide with shock and disbelief. The redhead steps forward, her expression stern, her voice carrying a heaviness that weighs down the air between us.\n\n\"You must,\" she says firmly, grabbing my wrist gently but with an undeniable strength. \"It is not just a task—it is an honor. You are cleaning the body of your master. It signifies your subservience, your acceptance of his claim over you.\"\n\nHer fingers tighten around mine, guiding them towards the waiting supplies as if my compliance is inevitable.\n\n\"But can't you—\" I start, my voice desperate, seeking any escape from this demeaning duty.\n\n\"No. This is your role now,\" interrupts another girl, her dark eyes serious as she adjusts the wrap around her own slender waist. \"Refusing to perform your duties can lead to punishment.\"\n\nThe room grows quiet, the gravity of their words sinking into my bones. The other slaves nod in agreement, their faces set in grim determination. They gather around, forming a tight circle, their proximity a barrier against my protests.\n\n\"This is how it must be done,\" continues the redhead, demonstrating with deliberate motions. \"You must be thorough but respectful. Start at his feet and work your way up. Be gentle around his...his manhood. It is the source of his strength, his pride.\"\n\nAnother slave, a younger girl with haunted eyes, hands me a small jar of an oily substance. \"Use this for his...for his groin. It helps cleanse thoroughly. And shows respect.\"\n\nI accept the jar with a hand that shakes so fiercely it nearly spills its contents. My face is a mask of dread as I turn to face Snib, who's reclining with a smirk plastered across his warty face. He's clearly enjoying the discomfort and turmoil he's incited in me.\n\nGuiding my hands, the slaves help me apply the oil. Each touch on Snib's disgusting skin is a battle against my revulsion, but the slaves' steadying hands and soft murmurs of encouragement keep me from fleeing.\n\n\"See? You're doing well,\" encourages the brunette as I hesitantly smear the oil across Snib’s chest, trying to avoid direct contact as much as possible.]The slaves explain the ritual to me, the reverence needed, the care and caution to use. They guide my hands, showing me the gentle strokes to use, the places to avoid, the exact way to cup his balls, the method to clean his stinking schlong. Their voices are matter-of-fact, as if they're instructing me on something as mundane as cooking a meal, not washing a virile goblin cock.\n\n\"But can't you—\" I start, but a firm shake of the head cuts me off.\n\n\"No. This is your duty,\" the redhead says, her eyes solemn. The others echo her sentiment, their faces serious. They emphasize the importance of this task, this subservient act of washing Snib, how it's more than just hygiene, but a ritual of respect, an act of servitude that solidifies my place as his property.\n\nGuided by the enslaved women, I approach Snib. The stench of him is stronger now, but I push through my disgust. It's a dreadful task, yet my mind barely registers it as I prepare to bathe him.\n\nThe women’s voices, hushed yet determined, guide me through each step. \"Start with his body,\" the brunette instructs, reverence in her voice. A wet cloth is shoved into my hand and I flinch at its damp coolness. My task is clear - to clean Snib's squat body. His skin, oily and slick with sweat, glistens under the low light, his gut protruding significantly. I grit my teeth, swallow back bile, and start.\n\nUnder my trembling hand, his warty skin is cold and wet, rough against the softness of my fingers. I try not to flinch as I drag the cloth over his bulging stomach, the folds of his flesh oily and unclean. I can hear the women whispering amongst themselves.\n\nNext, they guide me towards his lower body. My breath catches as the redhead steps closer, her voice hushed as she explains, “Now, his c- cock.\" She stumbles over the word, a blush coloring her cheeks. But her gaze is unyielding, filled with a determination that leaves me with no room for protest.\n\nI kneel in front of Snib's massive cock, my heart pounding. It’s an imposing sight, even in its flaccidity. My stomach churns as I reach out, my fingers trembling as they wrap around his massive, veiny shaft. The sensation of his slimy, cum-covered cock in my grasp sends a shiver down my spine.\n\nAs instructed, I clean it thoroughly, the slaves' whispers a constant murmur in the background. \"Good, Tit-bitch. Don't forget the veins... And the tip... Yes, just like that...\" They coo, their voices brimming with false encouragement.\n\nA sour taste creeps up my throat as I run the cloth over his cock, wiping away remnants of cum and Liliana's juices. The feel of it in my hands, slick and warm, is enough to make me gag. His phallic flesh is heavy, intimidating, a symbol of my humiliation and forced servitude.\n\nHis cock is veiny, thick and vascular, a symbol of the raw power that he wielded so freely just moments ago. I’m reminded of Liliana, the woman he likely just impregnated. The humiliation of this task, this ritual, burns hot within me. The memory of being Aldric, once the hero of Eboncrest, is but a fading ember against the reality of my present circumstance.\n\nDespite my horror, I continue with the cleaning, spurred on by the enslaved women's incessant whispers. My task is complex, each part of his grotesque body requiring a different care and attention. His cock, even flaccid, demands a certain amount of reverence, a detail the women emphasize over and over.\n\nThe entire process is incredibly surreal, every stroke of the cloth against his green skin, every crinkle of the skin beneath my fingers. The girls coo, pleased with my progress, but I feel only nausea and a simmering rage.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm a ghastly spectacle, bandaged up, my tits partly hidden, my skin raw and red. My bikini bottoms are the only piece of clothing that affords me some dignity.\n\nAmidst this ritual, my body betrays me. A heat rises within me, centered between my thighs, a heat that’s as unwelcome as it is uncontrollable. The scent of him, the musky, male scent, triggers an instinctive response in me, a base biological need of some kind. I shudder.\n\nThrough it all, the enslaved women's instructions never cease. Their tones are earnest, worshipful, they're under the goblins' sway, their minds clouded by months or years of the intoxicating pheromones. Their flushed faces, their wide eyes, they're entranced, lost to this world. And they want me to join them, to succumb to the goblins just like they did.\n\nThe women’s breathy whispers wash over me, their words echoing through the tent, a constant reminder of the humiliation and subservience. I am no longer Aldric, the hero, but Elise, the slave, the Tit-bitch.\n\nStill, I clean Snib, my hands moving with a life of their own. His skin is clean now, no longer slick with sweat and filth. I have no doubt that this could very well be the first time in Snib’s life he was ever clean…\n\nThe women guide me through the next phase, a ritual I'm woefully unprepared for. With hushed whispers, they hand me a collection of bottles, each filled with oils and creams of different colors and consistencies. There's a reverence in their movements, a worshipful attention to each bottle as they explain their purpose. They're specific, exacting. This isn't just cleaning. This is conditioning, treating Snib’s cock with a respect that churns my stomach.\n\nThe first bottle is filled with a thick, golden oil, an earthy aroma wafting from it. One of the women, her voice husky with pheromone-induced arousal, explains it's for his shaft. “Stroke it in. Use your fingers, not your palm, like this...” She demonstrates on her own hand, her fingers moving in slow, sensual circles. It's instructional, clinical, but the erotic undercurrent is unmistakable.\n\n[Choice: Use the oil.",

My fingers, slim and feminine, curl around Snib's cock, the skin soft and warm against the rough, oily texture of the goblin flesh. The oil slicks his skin, coating it in a sheen that catches the light. My fingers move over him, massaging in the golden oil as instructed.\n\nMy stomach clenches, a heat stirring deep inside me as I work the oil into his flaccid cock. It twitches in response, starting to fill out, starting to harden. The sensation sends a jolt through me, an involuntary reaction to a primal part of my mind. The feeling is uncomfortable, unwanted, but undeniably present.\n\nNext, the women hand me a bottle of green cream. “This is for his tip,” they explain, their voices breathless. They guide my hand, showing me how to apply the cream, how to massage it into the sensitive skin. The smell of the cream is rich, heady, an intoxicating scent that fills the tent.\n\nMy heart pounds in my chest, the scent of the cream stirring something deep within me. I can feel my body responding, my nipples hardening against the rough fabric of my bandages, a heat building between my thighs. I try to push the feelings down, to ignore them, but the physical sensations are overwhelming.\n\nThe cream melts under the heat of my hand, a sticky, slippery substance that adds another layer to the grotesque sensory overload. As I massage it into his cock, my fingers sliding over the sensitive tip, his skin pulses beneath my touch. His cock twitches again, and the sight of it, hardening, growing under my touch, sends a shudder of revulsion through me.\n\nAnother bottle is passed to me, a silver liquid shimmering within. The redhead instructs me in a breathy whisper, “This one's for his base, for the...uh, balls. You must be gentle, Tit-bitch. They're sensitive.”\n\nAs I apply the oil, I can't help but cringe. The sensation of his balls in my hand, the weight and texture, is nauseating. But I continue, driven by the whispers of the women and my own need to survive.\n\nTheir whispers fill the tent, their words echoing in my mind. They coach me, guide me, instructing me in the best ways to massage his balls. The process is meticulous, the attention to detail absurd in its intensity. My fingers move in circles, careful and precise, the silver oil making his sack glisten.\n\nThroughout it all, my arousal grows, a slow-burning heat that tightens my belly and sends warmth flooding to my cheeks. The scent of the oils, the feel of his flesh beneath my fingers, the sight of his hardening cock, it's all too much. It's a terrible, awful sensation that I can't control.\n\nThere's a tightness in my chest, a sensation in my breasts. My tits, heavy and bandaged, feel fuller somehow, as if the heat is spreading, reaching every part of my body. I can feel my pussy dampening, my panties growing wet despite my disgust. It's a physical reaction I can't control, a base biological response to the male pheromones in the air.\n\nMy humiliation is complete as the women hand me a ceremonial loincloth, a token of Snib's victory. Their faces are flushed, their eyes sparkling with arousal as they guide me in draping it over his now glistening cock. The cloth is soft, a rich, deep red, contrasting starkly against the grotesque spectacle of the conditioned goblin cock.\n\nThe loincloth fits snugly, highlighting the size and girth of Snib's hardened cock. I adjust it, ensuring it sits just right, a terrible symbol of his victory and my humiliation. My fingers tremble as I arrange the cloth, the fabric rough against my skin.\n\nI step back, taking in the sight. His cock is a monstrous thing, looming and grotesque, a symbol of my forced servitude. It's a sight that makes my stomach churn, but also sends a thrill of arousal through me, a reaction I despise. My body is betraying me, reacting to the male presence, to the goblin pheromones.\n\n\"Make way! Make way!

His eyes travel up and down my barely concealed figure, lingering on my heaving breasts and between my legs.

The room falls silent as the two goblins perform their traditional pact - a binding, brutish gesture signifying the gravity of their agreement. Grokk's loud, grating laugh fills the tent, echoing off the walls before he strides out.\n\nThe moment they depart, the deafening silence is broken by my outburst. \"You can't just... just trade me like I'm some... some piece of property!\" My words, raw and desperate, hang in the stagnant air.\n\nSnib turns his warty face towards me, an uncharacteristically serene expression on his face. My collar tightens around my neck, constricting my breath. I choke, gasping for air. But Snib just watches me as I collapse onto the tent floor. My bandaged body quivers, weak and trembling.\n\n\"No! You can't... you can't do this!\" I struggle to get the words out between gasps, my hand clawing at the cursed metal around my neck.\n\nBut my protests fall on deaf ears. Snib remains unmoved, watching me as I writhe on the floor, my voluptuous body heaving and jiggling in the scant armor. His green, veiny schlong even hardens at the sight, a glistening bead of pre-cum seeping out of its massive, shiny head.\n\n\"Enough, cow tits!” His guttural voice slices through my cries, \"Only if ye lose! If ye care so much, don't lose!\"\n\nHis words hit me like a punch to the gut, knocking the wind out of me. I'm on my hands and knees now, the collar slowly loosening its deadly grip around my neck. My chest heaves as I gasp in ragged breaths, my tears mingling with the dirt and grime on the floor.\n\n\"Master...\" I choke out, \"Master, please...\"\n\nAs if I could ever expect any sympathy from this horrid goblin, regardless of what gold I earn him.\n\nHis laughter rings hollow in the silence of the room. \"When receivin’ a proper challenge like this, from the chief no less, I HAVE ta agree.\" His words are sharp, devoid of any warmth or empathy. \"Fight hard, bitch.

My throat is dry, and I swallow hard, tasting the bitter bile at the back of my mouth.\n\nTears spring to my eyes, the hot salty drops rolling down my cheeks. The back of my hand brushes against my nose, catching a tear before it falls. I want to scream, to shout, to lash out, but all I can do is curl up, my body shaking with suppressed sobs.\n\nThe image of Elara's smiling face flashes in my mind, and I feel a pang of guilt deep in my chest. She wouldn't understand, wouldn't forgive me. But the need is unbearable, a sharp, gnawing ache deep within me. It's a physical torment, a desperation so intense I can barely breathe.\n\nA nauseating wave of self-loathing washes over me. I've been reduced to this, a needy, desperate woman begging a goblin for pleasure. The humiliation is scorching, an inferno that consumes me from the inside out. It's a new low, a depth of despair I've never known.\n\nWith a hideous delight, Snib drags me to the edge of the pile of furs. He lifts my ass, my body poised on my knees, my G-cup tits mashed into the animal hides. His rough, warty hands grip my wide hips, pulling my ass cheeks apart. I can feel his hot, fetid breath against my exposed pussy, the moist puff of air causing me to shudder in revulsion.\n\nEvery sensation is magnified, a tormenting symphony of disgust and arousal. The heat of his breath seeps into the folds of my pussy, tickling the sensitive flesh. My body betrays me, my pussy clenching and throbbing in response. I feel the wetness trickling down my thighs, a damning evidence of my body's betrayal.\n\nThe scent of my own arousal is musky and sweet, a distinct contrast to the earthy smell of the animal furs beneath me. It's a reminder of my base need, a physical manifestation of my desperation. I try to ignore it, to block it out, but it's as relentless as the throb between my legs.\n\nHis disgusting voice slices through the silence of the tent. \"You're a needy slut,\" he sneers, the words slapping against me like a physical blow. His laughter ripples through the air, filling the space around me with his triumphant gloating.\n\nSnib's rough, warty fingers dig into the pale flesh of my ass, pulling my cheeks apart again. There's an odd sensation of cool air brushing against my pussy, foreign and disconcerting. A humiliating gasp escapes my lips as the delicate folds of my cunt open to the frigid air. It's an intimate exposure I'm not used to, a breach of the masculine boundary I had once known.\n\n\"Never seen a cunt so wet,\" Snib cackles, the sound piercing the tense air like a wicked barb. His words fill me with dread, an awful sense of vulnerability that spreads from my exposed core to the rest of my body. I feel more like a woman in this moment than ever before, a pitiful contrast to my former glory as Aldric.\n\nThe feeling of having a pussy, a gap between my legs that yearns and aches, is alien to me. It's an unwelcome void, a vast chasm that echoes with the remnants of my lost virility. I remember the weight of my cock, the pride in my masculine prowess.\n\nThere's a noise that cuts through my thoughts, a wet, obscene squelch as Snib toys with my pussy, opening and closing it with his cruel fingers. The sound resonates in my ears, a lewd symphony of my disgrace.\n\nMy black hair fans out around me, strands of it sticking to the damp fur below. It clings to my face, an uncomfortable, foreign, feminine sensation.\n\nMy pussy ACHES, throbbing in rhythm with my pounding heartbeat. It's an alien sensation, a physical response to my forced femininity. \"That's a lot of cunt-slop,\" Snib taunts, each word laden with depraved glee.\n\nThen, the moment I've been dreading arrives. Snib's thick, warty tongue snakes its way up my pussy, sending a bolt of sensation shooting up my spine. I let out a low whimper, my voice muffled by the furs I'm pressing my face into. Each lick sends waves of unwanted pleasure rippling through my body.\n\nThe heat is unbearable. Sweat trickles down the curves of my body, beading at the tip of my nose and rolling off my cheek. My skin is on fire, a stark contrast to the cold air that teases my spread-open cunt. The chill makes me shiver, my large tits jiggling with the movement, mashing and wobbling amidst their bandaged confines.\n\n\"Juicy,\" Snib cackles, and my heart drops. My breath hitches in my chest. His vulgar words shatter any remnants of my dignity, reducing me to nothing more than an object of his pleasure.\n\nThen his tongue licks up the length of my pussy, hot and wet and utterly revolting. A jolt of something — disgust, humiliation, but also a shameful spark of pleasure — shoots up my spine. I try to stifle a whimper, pressing my face into the furs. The softness of the fur against my cheek is a stark contrast to the rough, brutal treatment of my pussy.\n\nHeat floods my body, flushing my skin as sweat trickles down my body. I can feel droplets rolling down my cheeks, pooling at the base of my neck, soaking into the bandages binding my massive tits. They're uncomfortably warm, mashed into the furs, a wobbling mass of softness in their tight confines.\n\nMy pussy throbs in rhythm with the licks of Snib's thick, clumsy tongue. Each stroke of his tongue sends sparks of sensation ricocheting through me, building a wave of tension. It's a lewd dance, an indecent rhythm that sends the blood rushing in my ears. The sparkles of pleasure are becoming a wave, a tide of tension that builds and builds within me.\n\n[Choice: He spanks you.",

Yet my body reacts, the tension within me winding tighter and tighter with every intrusive lick. A low moan escapes my lips, my voice muffled by the furs. The sounds I make are indecent, humiliating, yet I can't stop them. They fill the air, joining the squelching sounds to create a chorus of my submission.\n\nEach lick, each slurp, sends a shockwave of sensation through me. The feeling is overwhelming, a whirlwind of emotions and sensations that leaves me dizzy. The pleasure grows, the wave getting bigger and bigger. It's a tsunami of tension, looming and threatening, promising to crash down and engulf me in its terrible, unwanted ecstasy.\n\nThe ferocity of Snib's assault on my pussy grows, his tongue lashing against my throbbing, wet folds. It's a relentless rhythm, one that spirals my senses into a vortex of obscene sensations. The heat is unbearable, a fiery pulse that matches the lewd cadence of Snib's tongue.\n\nThe sounds I'm making... God, the sounds! They're an echo of my submission, a symphony of carnal surrender. Each moan, each gasp, serves as a testament to my unraveling. They're the crude language of my body, raw and undeniable. I hear them ricocheting off the canvas walls of the tent, taunting echoes of my humiliation.\n\nI can't help it, can't quell the torrent of moans that spill from my lips. They're a dam that has broken, releasing a flood of shameful, guttural sounds. They're primal, elemental, a fundamental expression of helpless female pleasure that I'm experiencing, truly, for the first time.\n\nI understand now. The moans, they're a signal, an instinctual reaction to pleasure. They are a surrender, an invitation. I feel the concept fully now, an understanding that sears into my mind with every stifled cry and whimper that escapes my lips.\n\nThe pleasure consumes me, a tidal wave of sensation that swells with each invasive lick. I feel it in every nerve ending, a tumultuous storm that upends my world. It's an awful ecstasy, one I wish I could quell. But it's there, inside me, swelling, expanding, an orb of sensation that pushes against the confines of my body.\n\n\"Good girl,\" Snib leers, his voice a grim reminder of my disgrace. The compliment is like a slap to the face, a cold gust of reality that tears through the veil of pleasure. But it does nothing to halt the impending climax, the powerful surge of release that threatens to crash over me.\n\nThe pleasure builds and builds, like a symphony reaching its crescendo. It's a dizzying whirl of sensation, a carousel of lewd thoughts and unwanted arousal. I moan louder, my cries full, uninhibited. They fill the tent, haunting refrains of my fall.\n\nWith every lick, every thrust of his rough, warty tongue, the tension spirals higher and higher. It's a cruel crescendo, an awful climax that looms on the horizon. The wave is coming, and I know, with a shudder of fear and anticipation, that I won't be able to outrun it.\n\n[Choice: Cum like a bitch.",

The sensation is so powerful, so intense, that my vision blurs, my eyes crossing as the earth-shattering climax takes hold. It's a physical shockwave, rippling outwards from my pulsating pussy, tearing through my body with devastating force.\n\nThe cry that tears from my throat is raw, primal, a squeal of surrender that bounces off the canvas walls of the tent. It's a testament to my defeat, my submission, my transformation. I'm no longer Aldric, the mighty warrior of Eboncrest. I'm Elise, the Goblin's pet, moaning and writhing in pleasure under the relentless assault of Snib's eager tongue.\n\nAs I convulse in the throes of the powerful orgasm, my heavy, G-cup breasts sway wildly under me, the bandages straining, tearing, and finally giving way. My tits spill out, bouncing freely, slapping against the fur with each violent shudder of my body.\n\nThe sounds are debauched, obscene, the kind of sounds no proud warrior should ever make. The squelching, the wet slurping as Snib eagerly laps up my pussy juices, the mewling cries torn from my throat, they all blend into a lewd symphony of my submission. My body betrays me, the powerful orgasm causing my pussy to squirt, the stream of cunt juice shooting out behind me, painting the furs beneath me.\n\nMy thighs tremble, the muscles straining under the violent shudders that tear through my body.

It's an unbearable ecstasy, a crescendo of arousal that leaves me breathless, gasping, mewling into the furs.\n\nThe climax is all-consuming, a tidal wave of pleasure that crashes over me, leaving me a quivering, gasping mess in its wake. I'm spent, utterly drained, my body aching with the remnants of the earth-shattering climax. I collapse onto the furs, my body heavy, the aftereffects of the orgasm still coursing through me.\n\nIn the wake of my climax, I'm a pathetic sight, my body sprawled on the furs, my once constricting armor replaced by torn bandages and glistening sweat. My thighs are slick with my own juices, the scent of my release filling the air. I feel hollowed out, sated yet defeated.\n\nSnib's voice fills the tent, a grating, guttural sound that echoes in the stillness. \"Ain't no hero no more, are ya, bitch?\" he says, the cruel delight clear in his tone.\n\nI can almost see the wicked grin splitting his warty face, the glistening eyes gleaming with sadistic joy.\n\n\"You're just a dumb cow, ain't ya? A dumb, jiggly cumdump. Squirtin’ everywhere.\"\n\nHis voice drips with mockery, every word a pointed jab at my fragile pride, a reminder of my debased state.

You hear that? Obey.\" His voice is low, menacing, the command leaving no room for argument.\n\nI feel a shudder course through me, not from pleasure, but from fear. Fear of the control he wields over me.\n\n\"All that fighting in the pits, doesn't make you a warrior,\" Snib continues, his voice thick with derision. \"You're just a bitch in heat. My bitch. And you're gonna start acting like one.\"\n\nThe thought is as horrifying as it is humiliating. I'm not a bitch. I'm a warrior. Or at least, I used to be.\n\n\"You'd better start behaving, you fat-assed tart.

A harbinger of the debasement that is to come.\n\n\"Yeah, keep telling yourself that, cow tits,\" Snib says, his words ringing in my ears as he retreats, leaving me lying there in a puddle of my own release, a pathetic, whimpering mess. As I hear the rustling of furs and the satisfied sigh of the goblin settling into our shared bed, I can't help but shudder, fear and loathing mingling with a perverse sense of satisfaction.\n\nAs I close my eyes, I can't help but think of the future, of the humiliations and degradation that surely await me.

Snib, his demeanor unusually sullen, stands before the pit-master’s hulking figure. The morning chill permeates the damp, dank interior of the tent, prickling against my scantily clad flesh. I am nothing more than an object in this world of crude exchanges and brutal combat.\n\nThe pit-master grins, revealing a jagged row of stained, yellow teeth. \"Snib,\" he chortles, “Today your ‘Tit-bitch’ will face Krognar.”\n\nKrognar? My heart sinks even further. It sounds like a troll name.\n\n\"He's Grokk's personal bodyguard,\" the pit-master continues, his voice heavy with suppressed mirth. \"A mountain of flesh and muscle, standing over eight feet tall. No opponent has ever lasted more than a few minutes against him. He's crushed the skulls of hardened warriors with one swipe of his hand, snapped limbs like twigs. Rumor has it, he's a deserter from the Skullcracker Brigade, the most infamous troll warband in the East. A brutal monster, even among his brutal kin.\"\n\nHe chuckles at Snib’s expression, my master’s face paler than I've ever seen it. “Grokk's instructions were clear though. Krognar ain't to kill her. Seems Grokk wants your juicy morsel intact for breeding.\"\n\nThat revolting statement stops my heart. A hot wave of revulsion crashes over me, a tsunami of dread washing away all other thoughts. If I’m taken by Grokk… I’ll never get home to Elara. I’ll never get out of this collar. I’ll be birthing goblin whelps until it kills me.\n\nI have to swallow back bile, my body trembling. I hate this. I hate them all. But I remain silent, staring at the ground, my cheeks flaming hot.\n\nSnib bristles at the pit-master's words, his fists clenching at his sides. \"This ain't a fair fight, it’s rigged. She's a fuckin’ human, not some indestructible beast.\"\n\nThe pit-master just chuckles, a coarse, unpleasant sound. \"You got your fill yesterday, Snib. Now, it's Grokk's turn. She's your Tit-bitch, yes, but remember that the slave's fate is always in the master’s hands.\"\n\n“Let me use magic,\" I blurt out, ignoring the biting chill that makes my nipples tighten against the metal of my bikini armor. \"If I could use magic—\"\n\nBut Snib cuts me off, shaking his head. \"It ain't allowed in the pits, Elise,\" he mutters, his eyes dark with worry. \"It’s be a loss anyhow.\"\n\nWith that, he turns and leaves, his heavy footsteps echoing around the empty tent. I stand there alone, my heart pounding in my chest. The pit-master's cruel laughter rings out behind me, a grim soundtrack to my impending doom.\n\nTears blur my vision. I choke them back, forcing myself to breathe. To think. This isn't the end. It can't be. I won't let it. But as the tent flaps close behind Snib, the weight of my plight presses down on me, a thousand times heavier than any armor I've ever worn.

The mocking cheers of the goblin spectators cascade around me, their words vile, degrading. Once again, they call me 'Tit-bitch' and their laughter is a sickening harmony to my fears.\n\nI raise my eyes, past the jeering crowd, to the throne perched high above the pit. Grokk sits there, lord of this disgusting spectacle, grinning with vile anticipation. My eyes narrow, my stomach clenches. If I survive this, it will be for Elara, not for his twisted enjoyment.\n\nBut my imminent opponent is what truly commands my attention. Krognar, the troll, a beast of truly hideous proportions. He towers over me, over eight feet of scarred muscle and bone. Each ridge and fold of his flesh looks like it's been carved from stone, his skin a grotesque patchwork of battle marks. His arms are grotesque tree trunks, capped with hands that have the strength to snap a warrior's skull like a ripe melon. His eyes are coal-black, filled with the promise of violence and blood.\n\nHis chest rumbles with a guttural growl that reverberates through the sand beneath my boots, a horrifying war drum to the cacophony of the crowd. This isn't just a troll. This is a troll war machine, a Skullcracker deserter, the kind of monster that has haunted my nightmares since I was Aldric.\n\nMy hands tighten around the wooden spear I took from the Wailing Widow. It's heavy, sturdy, the wood smooth from use and time. Against Krognar's monstrous bulk, it feels about as significant as a toothpick.\n\nThe weight of my G-cup chest seems suddenly heavier in my metal bikini top, the high-waisted armor biting into my hips as I brace myself, making my lush figure a startling contrast against the troll's grotesque physique. My ass jiggles slightly with the shifting of my stance, the sensation feeling foreign to my warrior's instincts, alien against the muscle memory of my former male self.\n\nThere's a ripple of excitement through the crowd, a shift of energy in the air that sinks heavy in my belly. I look around the pit, my eyes searching for anything, any small advantage. But all I see is sand, the high walls, the jeering crowd.\n\nA pang of despair courses through me but I force it down. My body is unfamiliar, yes, but the mind of Aldric, the legendary warrior, still resides within.\n\nWith a huff, I pull my raven-black hair back from my face, quickly tying it in a high, tight knot. It whips around me like a dark curtain as I move, getting it out of my way. But even in this dire moment, I cannot ignore the odd sensation of its weight lifted from my shoulders, another reminder of this damned transformation.\n\nThe crowd roars louder, the fight about to begin. I square my shoulders, grip my spear tighter, and take a deep breath, readying myself for the monster before me.\n\nMy thick thighs strain against the metal bikini bottoms as I begin to circle Krognar. His beady eyes watch me, amusement clear on his hideous face. His laughter, a gurgling, sickening sound, grates against my ears, his gaze crawling over my jiggling body like a filthy touch.\n\nThe sharp crunch of my metal stiletto heels on the gritty sand cuts through the crowd's raucous jeering. Each step is deliberate, my footwork precise even in these absurd boots. I can feel my wide hips sway, my large ass bouncing lightly with each step. Every movement causes my ample breasts to sway and jiggle beneath the restrictive metal bikini top, a sensation I'm still adjusting to. My body is a strange, lewd spectacle in this grotesque theatre. Deep down, past the layers of voluptuous flesh and the shell of femininity, the mind of a seasoned warrior pulses with anticipation.\n\nOver the jeering crowd, the announcer's next lewd comment cuts through the air, crude words about my body and my chances in the fight. The crowd's laughter burns into my skin, their gaze feasting on my body. My skin crawls under the weight of their stares. The plushness of my body, its softness, feels like a mockery in this brutal setting. I'm not a hardened warrior's body, but a curvaceous, voluptuous form meant for their lewd enjoyment.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm helpless.\n\n[Choice: Assess your enemy.",

The wood is sturdy, and the tip sharp, a valuable asset against the brute in front of me.\n\nKrognar's towering body is a fortress of muscle and scarred skin, a formidable defense. But every fortress has its weaknesses. Every breath he takes, every shift of his weight, the way his hulking body moves, I take it all in. I'm looking for a crack in his armor, a weakness in his defenses, anything I can exploit.\n\nThe sight of the monster before me is daunting, but I push the fear aside. I need to keep him at a distance, to use my spear to my advantage. I'm not as strong or as big as I used to be, but I still have my agility, my speed. I need to play this smart. I need to survive, for Elara. For myself.\n\nEvery time Krognar shifts his weight, his massive body sways, causing his meaty stomach to jiggle. A slow target. His movements are sluggish, the troll's large frame clearly not built for speed. I watch his flat feet shuffle across the sand, leaving deep imprints with every step. A lack of agility. Two points I can exploit.\n\nBut it’s not enough, not with my voluptuous body limiting my movements, my massive tits and wide hips throwing off my balance. My once firm warrior muscles have softened into plush flesh that jiggles at the slightest movement.\n\nMy strategy starts to take form. Speed and deception, that's how I’ll win this.\n\nI force my mind to view my body not as a curse but as a weapon, a diversion. I can distract him. Krognar's beady eyes keep falling to my jiggling breasts, his disgusting leer widening every time my tits sway with my movements. A distraction.\n\nI take a deep breath, drawing myself up to my full height, and my breasts thrust out, straining against the restrictive metal top. Krognar's eyes follow the movement, and I see my chance. If I can keep him focused on my body, on the jiggling and swaying, I can catch him off guard.\n\nWith the crowd's jeering fading into background noise, I force my attention back to my opponent. I twirl the wooden spear in my hand, testing its balance, feeling its weight. The reach of the spear is my only physical advantage here. I need to keep Krognar at a distance, poke and prod at him, find that weak spot.\n\nI spring into action, closing the gap between us in a few quick strides. The sand shifts and slides under my stiletto boots, and I must fight to maintain my balance, my big ass jiggling with the effort. I lash out with my spear, driving the sharp point towards Krognar's massive torso. The troll casually swats the spear away with a bored grunt, my attack barely phasing him.\n\nI dance back, breasts bouncing with the sudden movement, just as Krognar swipes lazily in my direction. I twist away, barely avoiding the blow. Despite his size, he’s faster than he looks. But he’s clearly not giving it his all, his sick grin telling me he’s enjoying the spectacle of me, trying to fight him in my metal bikini and high heels.\n\nHe's toying with me, waiting for the right moment to crush me like a bug. But every swipe, every growl, every movement, gives me information. Krognar is slow to retract his arms after a swipe, his enormous bulk limiting his agility. I keep darting in and out, launching a series of quick, jabbing attacks with my spear, studying his movements, finding his rhythm.\n\nMy spear whistles through the air, my body moving with a mind of its own, my warrior instincts kicking in. One of my thrusts grazes his chest, drawing a thin line of black blood. It’s not much - his hide is thick and tough - but it's a start.\n\nA chorus of laughter echoes from the stands, and I glance up to see Grokk, comfortably seated on his throne, chuckling at my efforts. But I ignore him, focusing on the task at hand.\n\nSweat trickles down my back, the salty droplets following the curve of my spine, disappearing into the small of my back. The fight has barely begun, and I can already feel the strain in my muscles. But I can't afford to stop. I can't afford to lose. I need to find a way to bring this monstrous troll down, and fast. My eyes flit back to Krognar, his amused smirk inciting a surge of determination within me. I ready my spear for another attack, my resolve hardening. I will bring this troll down, one jab at a time.\n\nThe goblin announcer's grating voice fills the air, his crass words bouncing off the walls of the arena. \"Looks like our Tit-bitch is trying to poke Krognar to death. You're going to need more than that to scratch our champion, love,\" he jeers, setting off another round of raucous laughter from the crowd.\n\n[Choice: Attack again!",

Yet, there's no time for self-consciousness - I have a battle to fight.\n\nDetermined, I rush at the troll again, my spear arcing through the air. Krognar deflects my attack with a swing of his massive arm, the impact reverberating down my spear and into my hands. I quickly recoil, using the momentum to pivot away from his retaliating swipe.\n\n\"I hope you're not tiring out, Tit-bitch. You haven't even made him sweat yet,\" the announcer chimes, his cackling laughter mingling with the jeers of the crowd. But I ignore him. I'm starting to learn Krognar's movements, the rhythm of his attacks and defenses. I just need to keep pressing, keep prodding, keep pushing.\n\nI dive forward again, feinting an attack to his midsection before switching at the last second to aim for his knee. But he's too quick, his foot stomping down and causing me to misstep. I stumble, my high-heeled boots sinking into the soft sand.\n\n\"Watch your step, Tit-bitch. We wouldn't want you to twist an ankle,\" the announcer jibes, and the crowd roars with laughter. I grit my teeth, quickly righting myself, my wide hips swaying with the effort. This isn't going as planned, but I need to adapt. I need to be creative. So, I decide to change my strategy.\n\nRather than using my spear for direct attacks, I start to use it as a vaulting pole. I run at Krognar, planting the butt of my spear in the sand. Using the leverage, I vault upwards, aiming a sharp kick towards his head with my steel stiletto boot.\n\nThe surprise tactic pays off. My heel connects with a solid thud, leaving a bloody gash on Krognar's cheek. He reels back, clutching at his face, a guttural roar of pain and fury echoing throughout the arena. The crowd goes silent, their jeering laughter abruptly cut off.\n\n\"Oh, it seems Tit-bitch has some fight in her after all,\" the announcer states, a note of surprise in his voice. But there's no time to savor the moment. The success of my attack has enraged Krognar, and he's no longer laughing. Now, I've really got a fight on my hands.\n\nKrognar is a monolith of malice, a titan of muscle and savage strength, a twisted parody of nature's grand design. His body is a grotesque blend of corded muscle and raw, bulging flesh, a clear testament to a life marred by unrelenting brutality. The sight of him is enough to strike fear into the heart of the bravest warrior, and standing here, my jiggly G-cup chest heaving with breathless anticipation, my stomach knots in fear.\n\nI see the rage ignite in his eyes, replacing the previously bored amusement. The change is terrifying, his towering figure somehow growing even more imposing. His roar is deafening, rattling me down to my bones. \"Well, ain't this a sight!\" The announcer's voice booms, the excitement in his tone adding to my trepidation.\n\nThe troll charges, the ground trembling beneath his weight. Panic flares in my chest as I turn on my stiletto heels, my wide hips swaying with the abrupt movement. My long raven hair whips around as I start to run, heart pounding, adrenaline surging.\n\n\"Run, Tit-bitch, run!\" The goblin announcer's voice follows me, echoing in the arena. The crowd is screaming, some laughing, the noise a deafening backdrop to my desperate evasion. My scant armor offers little protection against the rampaging troll, my voluptuous body a soft target for his murderous rage.\n\n[Choice: Run!",

My thighs burn with the exertion, my ass bouncing with every panicked stride. His enraged roars are growing louder, closer. Fear tastes bitter on my tongue as I try to outpace the hulking beast.\n\nI attempt to twist away from an incoming blow, but my high heels catch in the sand. My heart pounds against my chest, a wild bird desperately trying to escape its cage, as I see Krognar's huge fist come swinging towards me. There's no time to dodge. No time to do anything but brace myself.\n\nThe hit lands hard and brutal, sending me flying through the air. The world blurs as I tumble over the sand, the wind is knocked out of me. I finally skid to a stop, groaning, my body aching from the harsh impact.\n\nFor a moment, the arena is silent. And then, the crowd goes wild. Cheering, laughing, the noise is deafening. \"And there goes Tit-bitch! Looks like our champion isn't holding back anymore!\" the announcer crows, his words a sickening echo in my ringing ears. I grit my teeth, a defiant glare directed at the troll standing over me, my voluptuous body sprawled across the sandy floor.\n\nThe wooden shaft of my spear lurches upwards as I jab at the troll's underbelly, aiming for a soft spot in the creature's bulging flesh. A painful roar bursts from its maw as the tip of my weapon connects. But my victory is short-lived.\n\nKrognar's meaty fist slams downward, and instinct takes over. I roll, narrowly avoiding the blow that would surely have crushed me. Springing to my feet, I retaliate - a hard, brutal strike with the sharp heel of my metal boot to his foot. Again, he roars. But the fury in his eyes promises retribution.\n\nI twist my hands around my spear, bracing myself for the onslaught. But the troll is faster, his massive hand batting away my weapon with terrifying ease. A guttural roar erupts from the crowd. I hear the goblin announcer's crude commentary over the roar, but it's distant, muffled.\n\nIn the split second I have to react, I dive out of the troll's reach, narrowly evading another bone-crushing blow. But my luck runs out. Before I can recover, Krognar's massive fist slams into me, sending me sprawling in the sand once again.\n\nI see his massive foot moving towards me. My mind is screaming, 'Move!', but my body isn't obeying. And then it happens.\n\n[Choice: He breaks your leg...",

Tears stream down my face, mixing with the sand and grime on my cheeks. My ears ring with the ecstatic cries of the crowd and the goblin announcer's merciless commentary.

My throat is dry, parched, aching from the cries of pain that must have been torn from it. The scent of herbs and healing salves assaults my nostrils.\n\nMy eyelids feel heavy, resisting the urge to open. When I finally force them to part, a blinding flood of light sears my retinas. I squint, trying to adjust to the brightness. After a few seconds, shapes start to form. The sight of my legs, awkwardly held together with crude splints and wrapped in rough, green goblin cloth, sends a fresh wave of pain ripping through me.\n\n\"I... where am I?\" My voice, hoarse and strained, feels alien to my ears.\n\n\"Ahh, the Tit-bitch awakens.\" The source of the voice steps into my line of sight. A goblin, clothed in strange, worn out rags and holding a staff topped with a pulsating crystal, his wrinkled, green face is etched with cruel delight. \"You're in Chief Grokk's tent.\"\n\nGrokk? A fresh wave of terror washes over me. My heart pounds in my chest as I try to sit up, but I can't. There's something holding me down. A chill runs through me as I look around. I'm stuck in a strange contraption, a rack of some kind.\n\n\"Why... why can't I move?\" Panic seizes me, a bone-chilling dread that grips my heart.\n\n\"Ah, this,\" the goblin shaman motions to the device, his expression twisted into a malevolent grin. \"This is a breeding rack, dear. For your comfort and convenience, of course.\"\n\n\"Breeding rack?\" My voice is a choked whisper, horror slicing through me like a blade.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n\"Wh-what are you talking about?\" I rasp, my voice barely audible.\n\n\"Two days,\" he says, his voice dripping with a twisted satisfaction. \"You've been out for two days. Your legs, they're almost fully healed. Goblin magic, see?\" He chuckles, his tone one of perverse pride.\n\nI barely register the words, my mind stuck on the phrase he used earlier. \"Breeding rack?\" I repeat, my voice hollow. The room seems to spin. A breeding rack?\n\n\"Ah, yes. Keeps you in the perfect position for when you're ready,\" he says, as if discussing the weather. \"For Grokk.\"\n\n\"No... no, no, no,\" I mumble, desperately shaking my head. I'm not some breeding sow. This isn't happening. This can't be happening.\n\nBut it is. The cold reality hits me like a punch to the gut. I'm trapped. Even if I could free myself from this horrific rack, my legs are useless, broken.\n\nI rattle against my bonds, but it's futile. The laughter of the goblin shaman rings in my ears, echoing my despair.\n\n\"Chieftain Grokk!\" The tent flap parts, and Grokk, the hulking goblin king, steps into the dimly lit space.\n\n[Image: borderless]\nGrokk is a behemoth of a creature, even amongst his kin. His massive, barrel-chested figure looms over the cramped enclosure, an imposing silhouette that threatens to fill every nook and cranny of the tent. The gruff, commanding figure is draped in royal furs and metals, announcing his authority to all who dare look his way.\n\nHe casts an appreciative gaze over me, his eyes lingering on my naked, vulnerable form. I shrink under his lecherous gaze, my skin prickling under his obvious evaluation.\n\nThe shaman, Grouz, shuffles closer to Grokk. \"A perfect specimen, my lord,” he croaks. “Perfect in every way. Her hips are wide, designed for birthin' goblin pups. Her virginal pussy untouched, a ready vessel for your seed.\"\n\n“Hah. Snib never broke her in proper.”\n\nMy stomach churns at his crude words. My cheeks burn with a mix of anger and humiliation.\n\nHe steps closer, his gnarled fingers tracing the swell of my breasts. \"And her tits... oh, the milk these will provide,\" the shaman says to Grokk, a vulgar grin spreading across his toothless mouth. \"I'd estimate... two, maybe three gallons a day once the pregnancies hit full swing. The whelps need strong, nutritious milk, and she’ll be brimming with it.\"\n\n*He's reaching to grope me...*",

The rough material digs painfully into my skin as I wiggle and twist, but the restraints hold me firm. A whimper escapes me, but it’s drowned out by the harshness of my own labored breaths.\n\nGrokk's eyes seem to glow with a malicious pleasure as he watches my fruitless struggles; his gaze on my exposed and vulnerable form only fuels my desperation. My chest heaves as I pant, drawing ragged breaths filled with the dank, musty air of the tent.\n\n“Silence her,” Grokk commands gruffly, annoyance tinging his voice as he continues to appraise me like livestock.\n\nWithout missing a beat, Grouz shuffles closer, a filthy rag in his gnarled hand. As he approaches, I make one last futile attempt to twist away, my eyes wide with horror. But it’s no use—quick as a viper, he stuffs the rag into my mouth. The taste of mildew and dirt floods my senses, causing my stomach to churn with disgust. Tears spring to my eyes as I gag, my muffled cries vibrating pathetically against the cloth.\n\nGrokk continues his examination without further hindrance. His large, rough hand gropes at my other breast, squeezing the sensitive flesh none-too-gently. I squirm under his touch, my eyes watering both from pain and humiliation, my muffled protests continuing behind the rag.\n\nGrouz watches with a gleam of interest in his beady eyes. \"There is one minor concern, Chieftain. She's not in heat yet. Her body is not ready for conception.\"\n\nGrokk's fierce scowl deepens.\n\nThe shaman’s lips curl into a sly smile, \"I suggest we start her on a regimen of gobble-goo. It'll prime her body for breeding quick enough,” he explains, the twisted joy in providing such a solution evident in his tone.\n\nThe chieftain steps back, giving me one more leering once-over before turning and exiting the tent, his heavy steps thudding ominously on the tent floor.\n\nWith Grokk gone, the shaman’s attention turns fully towards me. My heart pounds in fear as he approaches, his shadow falling over me ominously. Grouz produces a small, wickedly carved wooden totem, whispering dark incantations as his fingers trace sinister symbols in the air.\n\n\"Nighty night, my pretty,\" he hisses menacingly as he continues his chant. The heavy scent of old earth and something unnervingly sweet begins to fill the air, making my head swim. Dizziness assaults me, riding on the waves of fear and helplessness that crash through my mind.\n\nI thrash against the restraints, my body convulsing in a last desperate attempt to escape the oncoming darkness that these incantations surely promise. But my strength is fading, leached away by whatever foul magic Grouz conjures. My struggles grow weaker, my muffled cries quieter, as an unnatural sleepiness begins to drag me down into the abyss.\n\nAs the world dims, the last thing I see is Grouz’s crooked smile, wide and victorious, as the darkness claims me entirely. The terror of what awaits when I awaken lingers, a silent scream echoing in the void.]Grokk grunts, his crude hand reaching out to cup my breast fully. The touch sends a shudder through me. I squirm, but the sturdy rack holds me firm. I feel the leather of the straps digging into my skin, confining my movements. My legs ache, the shattered bones protesting any movement.\n\nHe looks at me like a butcher would look at a piece of prime meat. A fresh catch, ready for breeding, ripe for the taking.\n\nHis gaze turns to Grouz, a question lingering in his eyes. Grouz clears his throat, \"There is one... minor concern though, Chieftain. She's not in heat yet. Her body is not ready for conception.\"\n\nGrokk raises a questioning eyebrow, his thick fingers still toying with my breast. Grouz continues, \"I suggest we start her on a regimen of gobble-goo'. It'll prime her body for breeding quick enough.”\n\nI blink, struggling to process his words.\n\nGrouz grins, revealing his yellowing, decaying teeth. \"A potent mixture, Chieftain. Three days of feed, and she'll be ready for you.\"\n\nGrokk grunts, releasing my breast and stepping back. His lecherous gaze scans me one last time before he strides out of the tent, leaving me alone with the disgusting shaman and the unfamiliar fear of what's to come.\n\nGrouz shuffles towards me, his hunched frame illuminated by the dimly flickering torchlight. He produces a small, wooden totem from the depths of his tattered robe. Carved in the likeness of some phallic deity, its hollow eyes seem to burn with an eerie, otherworldly light.\n\n\"Nighty night, my pretty,\" he rasps, a sinister grin twisting his sallow features. His fingers dance in a complex pattern around the totem, whispering unintelligible incantations under his breath.\n\nMy eyelids begin to grow heavy as he chants, a potent weariness seeping into my bones. Every sound seems to recede into the background, the world growing fuzzy around the edges. Even the relentless throbbing in my legs starts to fade, replaced by an encompassing warmth.\n\n\"Don't fight it, my dear,\" Grouz says, his words wrapping around me like a cloak. \"This is a healing sleep. It'll restore your strength. You'll need all of it.”\n\nI want to scream, to struggle, but the potent spell wraps around me, pulling me down into its warm embrace. My vision blurs, Grouz's grinning face becoming nothing more than a distorted smear of color.\n\nThe last thing I hear before I surrender to the heavy pull of sleep is Grouz's whisper, a lullaby from the depths of hell, \"Rest now, pretty. Tomorrow, we begin.\"\n\nDarkness wraps me in its welcoming embrace, my consciousness slipping away as the healing spell does its work. All that's left is the echoes of Grouz's chilling words.\n\n[Choice: You're in and out of a daze...",

Their bodies are draped in gauzy outfits, so transparent that it leaves very little to the imagination.\n\nGrokk grins at them, eyeing their exposed flesh with a gleam in his eyes.

It’s a very hard effect to remove, taking months of medical attention and therapy.\n\nThese last few days, I haven't had access to Moonshade potion, my only shield against the mind-bending effects of goblin cum. My thoughts race and panic sets in, making my heart pound against my chest.

It's enormous, at least sixteen inches long and thick as a human forearm, its appearance both fascinating and repulsive. Veins bulge along its length, giving it a brutal, monstrous look that sends shivers down my spine. His cock head is a dark, angry orange, already drooling with viscous pre-seed. The sight of it is petrifying, my blood freezing in my veins.\n\nThe two slave girls hover over him, their expressions full of lascivious anticipation. One of them, a brunette with wavy locks that cascade down her back, bends down, her lips pressing against the goblin king's soft cock. A soft, cooing sound escapes her as she lavishes it with her affection. The blonde at Grokk's other side follows suit, her full lips puckering to plant delicate kisses up and down his length. Their nimble fingers explore the intimidating size of Grokk, causing it to twitch in response.\n\nThey start worshiping his cock...",

It's heavy, cloying, mingling with the sharp tang of fear and arousal that surely emanates from my own helpless body.\n\n\"Imagine it, Elise,\" the brunette continues, her voice low and cruelly enticing. \"Laden with Grokk's hefty load, your belly stretching day by day. Isn't it delicious, the thought of being so wonderfully filled?\"\n\nThe squelching intensifies. \"He's close, he's so close!\" squeals the blonde excitedly.\n\n\"And he's huge, Elise. You should see how thick and ready he is. I can barely get my hands around him,\" the brunette adds, her tone dripping with mock empathy. \"All that for you, darling, to fill you up so perfectly.\"\n\nI shudder, a wave of icy dread washing over me as the first drops of pre-seed hit the base of the funnel with a small, audible plop.\n\nGrokk's heavy breathing turns to low, primal growls, each exhale a thunderous sound that vibrates through my bones. The air grows thick with the heat of his lust, the musky scent of his body an oppressive cloak around us.\n\n\"Here it comes, Elise,\" the blonde giggles, her voice tinged with wicked triumph. \"Ready to drink up?\"\n\nGrokk's deep, rumbling moans grow louder, more frequent. \"Ugh, yeah, just like that,\" he grunts, the raw, primal sound vibrating through the tent.\n\n]They speak in soft, breathy tones, \"Oh, Elise, you're going to love this,\" the brunette purrs, her eyes on me while her hand continues to stroke Grokk's cock. \"You're going to be such a good mother... your wide hips, your beautiful face, perfect for Grokk's offspring.\"\n\nGrokk's phallus continues to grow under their ministrations, each twitch bringing it closer to its full, terrifying size. The girls giggle, commenting on its size, the girth, the length, and the formidable weight it carries. Their small hands struggle to encompass its monstrous proportions, and the sight sends a shudder of revulsion through me.\n\nThe goblin king's cock twitches again, more vigorously this time, pre-seed seeping from the tip. It's hot and potent, a visual reminder of its intended purpose. The gooey liquid drips down, a bead of it landing on the edge of the funnel. The sight sends a chill down my spine, my eyes widening in horror as the reality of my situation sinks in.\n\n\"Oh, just imagine it,\" the blonde murmurs, her voice a sinful whisper. \"You, heavy with Grokk's children. Your belly round and full. Your tits... oh, your tits, all swollen and milky.\" Her eyes gleam with a perverse excitement, her words spurring a new wave of panic within me.\n\nThe pre-seed continues to drip from Grokk's now fully erect cock, pooling at the base of the funnel. The girls continue to coo and purr, their fingers deftly coaxing more from him. Their hands, slick with his fluids, glide effortlessly over his length. The grotesque tableau unfolding before me seems to stretch on for an eternity, each passing second another notch of dread lodged within me.\n\nThe pungent scent of the pre-seed fills the air, a musky odor that clings to the back of my throat. It's an odor I'll become all too familiar with, a stark reminder of the biological reality of my situation. The liquid gathers at the base of the funnel, a thin pool that glimmers under the light. My stomach churns, bile rising in my throat at the sight.\n\nThe brunette runs her tongue along the underside of Grokk's cock, her eyes twinkling with glee. She murmurs soft praises, her words slurred by the massive girth in her mouth. The blonde giggles, her fingers playing with the strands of pre-seed that string between her fingers. Their enthusiasm, the joy they find in this obscene act, turns my stomach.\n\nEach twitch of Grokk's cock, each droplet of pre-seed, sends a new wave of horror washing over me. I'm trapped, unable to escape, forced to watch as these two girls prepare to feed me with goblin seed. The reality of my situation settles over me like a suffocating blanket, my mind reeling at the prospect of what's to come. The feeding tube, lodged firmly in my mouth, feels like a mockery, a cruel twist in this nightmarish scenario.\n\nThe girls continue their work, their hands stroking, their lips kissing, their tongues licking, each movement driving Grokk closer to his climax. His massive cock twitches violently, the thick vein that runs along the underside pulsing with his impending release. I watch in mute horror as they coax more pre-seed from him, the thick liquid dripping down into the funnel, a precursor to the flood that's soon to come.\n\nTheir lewd whispers fill the room, their descriptions of my impending maternity sending spikes of fear through my already frantic mind. My gaze darts to the glistening cock, to the funnel, to the feeding tube lodged firmly in my mouth. This is my reality, my impending fate.",

It's pointed directly at the funnel's wide mouth, pulsating under the attention of the two slave girls. The stench of goblin lust permeates the air, a heady scent that makes my head spin. I watch, my heart pounding in my chest, as the blonde girl reaches under Grokk, her dainty hand cradling his heavy balls.\n\n\"Mmm, Grokk,\" she coos, her voice dripping with lewd enthusiasm. \"Your balls are so full, I can feel it. You're gonna blow such a massive load.\"\n\nThe brunette girl, her fingers continuing to glide up and down Grokk's enormous shaft, adds in her own voice, breathy with anticipation, \"Can't wait to see it. Shoot it right into the funnel. It's gonna be so hot.\"\n\nMy heart hammers in my chest, fear and disgust turning my stomach. The two girls are entranced, completely under the influence of goblin pheromones. Their minds are gone, consumed by an insatiable lust that I can't begin to comprehend.\n\nThe blonde takes a moment to spit into her palm, her hand glistening with saliva as she reaches to join her companion. Their hands move in harmony, stroking the massive cock in tandem, their slender fingers struggling to encompass its girth. Their soft, submissive murmurs and praises fill the room, a lurid chorus that accompanies the obscene sight before me.\n\nThe feeding tube is a cold, unyielding presence in my mouth, a vile tether connecting me to the imminent grotesque spectacle. I feel trapped, so utterly powerless. The sensation of the rubber against my tongue, the taste of it, is a cruel reminder of my plight. Each breath I draw is laced with the musk of the goblins, the primal, animalistic scent of arousal. It's suffocating, filling my nostrils and coating my throat.\n\nI watch as the girls service Grokk, their delicate hands stroking him, their wet mouths whispering filthy praises. Their obedience, their eagerness, is terrifying. The sound of their hands sliding over his slick, engorged member echoes around the tent, adding another layer to my torment.]With my eyes tightly shut, I try to block out the abhorrent scene unfolding before me, but the sounds are impossible to ignore. The wet, thick noise of the girls' hands working Grokk's monstrous cock fills the tent, interspersed with their lewd giggles and lascivious whispers.\n\n\"Oh, Grokk, you're so full,\" coos the brunette in a singsong voice, her tone dripping with a perverse glee. \"Listen to that, Elise. Can you hear how much he's throbbing? Just for you.\"\n\nThe blonde chimes in, her voice a sinful symphony of excitement, \"He's pulsing so hard. Can you imagine all that thick goblin cum building up, ready to burst out?\"\n\nI squeeze my eyes shut even tighter, a futile attempt to shut out their words, but then I hear it—the unmistakable sound of Grokk's release. A heavy, wet splattering noise echoes off the walls of the tent as his seed hits the funnel.\n\n\"It's coming, Elise! Grokk's giving you a big one!\" the blonde exclaims, her voice pitched high with exhilarated shock.\n\nThe sound is horribly visceral, the splashing and squelching of thick, viscous fluid filling the metal funnel. My stomach churns, bile rising in my throat from the auditory assault alone.\n\n\"Look at it go! It’s so thick and creamy!\" the brunette giggles, her tone reveling in the degradation of the moment. \"He’s practically pissing cum, it’s just pouring out!\"\n\nGrokk grunts heavily, the sound guttural and animalistic, adding a terrifying soundtrack to the already dreadful scene. The girls laugh, their high-pitched giggles mingling with the squelch of extra-thick semen filling up the funnel.\n\n\"His balls were so heavy, Elise! You should have felt them; loaded and ready to pump you full!\" the blonde teases, her voice laced with inappropriate amusement.\n\nThe brunette adds with a snicker, \"Oops, got a pubic hair in there too! That’s going to be a fun surprise when it gets to her.\"\n\nI can hear the slap of their hands on his wet skin, each hit a nauseating reminder of what's coming toward me.\n\nDriven by a morbid impulse, I finally open my eyes. The sight that greets me is a nightmare made manifest. Grokk's cum is indeed filling the funnel, a disgusting blob of slimy off-white sludge that’s undeniably pushing through the tube.\n\nMy breath hitches in my throat as I watch the thick goo slowly make its way through the transparent tubing, each inch it travels a tick of a terrifying countdown. The reality of it, seeing the amount of glistening, pungent seed meant for me, sends a cold wave of panic through me. The horrendous concoction draws nearer, gravity and Grokk's relentless ejaculation forcing it along the inevitable path into my mouth.\n\nThe girls are still talking, their voices overly bright and terribly loud in the tense air.\n\n\"He really was backed up, wasn’t he?\" the brunette muses with a laugh, squeezing the base of Grokk’s shaft to milk out every last drop. \"Just look how that fills up, Elise! It’s a river of cum!\"\n\n\"Yes, all just for you, Elise. To make sure you're in heat so Grokk can breed you proper,\" the blonde adds, her tone mockingly sweet. \"Aren't you lucky?\"\n\nMy mind races, thoughts whirling as I try to comprehend my predicament. I don't want this. I don't want to be forced to swallow goblin seed. Fear rises, a harsh lump in my throat that I can't swallow down. What will it do to me? Will I end up like those girls, lost to goblin pheromones, my mind reduced to a sexually obsessed shell?\n\nA cold dread settles over me as I watch the girls coax Grokk closer to his climax. Each stroke, each lustful whisper, brings him closer to the edge, the sight of his cock twitching and throbbing a terrifying promise of what's to come. I watch as the first glob of thick, pearly seed spills from his cock, my stomach churning as it lands in the funnel. The grim reality of my fate echoes in the hollow pit of my stomach. This is just the beginning, and there's no way out.\n\nThe terror gnaws at my insides, my body quaking with a primal need to escape, to get away from this obscene spectacle. My body tenses, straining against the soft but immovable restraints of the rack. The leather bites into my wrists, my ankles. My body jiggles with each futile struggle, my splinted legs aching with a renewed pain.\n\nMy frantic attempts to dislodge the feeding tube are met with failure. The thick rubber is lodged too deep, too secure. My tongue prods uselessly against it, my muffled cries echoing hollowly in my throat. My breaths grow harsh and ragged, the rubber taste of the tube making me gag.\n\nI can feel every jiggle of my breasts, every shift of my hips, accentuated by the wide spread of my legs. I can feel the cold air of the tent on my exposed pussy, a cruel reminder of my vulnerable position.\n\nGrokk's cock twitches, and my stomach drops. A bead of pre-cum, thick and milky, drips from the tip, landing in the funnel with a sickening plop. I watch, frozen in horror, as another drop forms, hanging precariously before it joins the first. My mind screams in protest, the reality of my imminent fate settling over me like a heavy shroud.\n\nThe girls' voices reach a fever pitch, their praises growing more explicit, more vulgar. They tell Grokk how much they want to see him blow his load, how they can't wait to see my belly swollen with his seed. The words are like a slap, each syllable a blow that hits harder than any physical strike.\n\n[Choice: Try to struggle!",

It's like the last few spurts were just a precursor...\n\nThe next blast comes out in a thick, heavy jet, a steaming, off-colored stream that's so potent it misses the funnel entirely. It splatters across the tent floor, a grotesque display of virility that makes my stomach churn.\n\nHis balls tighten in response to the release, visibly shifting in the blonde girl's grasp. They both exclaim in surprise, their voices a heady mix of disappointment and encouragement, and hurriedly adjust the angle of his cock. They point it directly at the funnel, their hands working in a frantic, apologetic frenzy to correct their mistake.\n\nMy heart drops as the second spurt of cum lands directly in the funnel. It's a monstrous spurt, heavy and putrid, the curdled yellow substance plopping into the funnel like some horrendous pudding. The scent hits me then, a bleachy, tangy odor that's so intense it makes my eyes water.\n\nThe cum begins to travel down the tube, its consistency heavy and sticky, making its descent agonizingly slow. The tube is transparent, which only adds to my horror as I watch it fill. I can see each spurt of Grokk's seed, every thick, ropey strand of it, as it's pushed down the tube, carried by the weight of the semen following behind.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nIt's the most disgusting, nightmarish sight I've ever witnessed. It feels like a grotesque version of an hourglass, each spurt of Grokk's cum a grain of sand counting down the seconds to my doom.\n\nGrokk's ejaculations continue, each one a loud, virile announcement of his dominance. Each spurt is a proclamation, a declaration that he's the alpha, the king, and we are nothing more than his subjects.\n\nHis cock keeps pumping out those horrible ropes of cum, the girls milking him eagerly, their hands slick and shiny with his seed. Their praises fill the tent, their voices high and excited, lost in the throes of their pheromone-induced devotion.\n\nAs the tube continues to fill, the scent grows stronger, the bleachy odor intensifying. The first hint of the taste hits my tongue, an awful, bitter tang that makes me want to gag. The tube is only partway filled, but the sheer amount of cum Grokk has produced is already overwhelming.\n\nMy panic escalates, my mind racing as I try to find a way out of this. I can't take it, I can't accept this, I can't let this happen. But my body is immobile, my pleas silenced, my cries for help reduced to muffled whimpers.\n\nThere's nothing I can do but watch, helpless, as the tube continues to fill.\n\nI see the yellowish sludge steadily sliding closer. The odor intensifies, making my eyes water. My stomach roils in disgust, but I'm unable to turn away. There's a cold dread pooling in my belly as the seconds tick away.\n\nThe sight of the off-white slime inching closer is mesmerizing in a horrifying kind of way. It's like a slow-motion disaster. My lips are sealed around the rubbery end of the tube, my throat reflexively closing off in a futile attempt to keep the impending invader out.\n\n*This can't be happening!!!*\n\n[Image: borderless]",

My neck strains against the movement, the muscles pulling taut as I push against the unyielding leather strap that holds my head in place. I can feel the tube shift slightly, but the rigidity of the setup is too much. The semen, thick and relentless, follows the curve of the tube unimpeded, moving ever closer to its target. My efforts are in vain, and dread fills me as I realize there's no escaping my feeding.]In a frantic bid for control, I attempt to blow air through the tube, thinking perhaps I can push the semen back up and away from me. My cheeks puff out as I exhale sharply, the force of my breath traveling up the tube. For a heart-stopping second, I imagine it might actually work, but then I feel the backdraft. The cum, heavy and thick, merely wobbles under the pressure before settling back down, continuing its relentless journey toward me.]As a last resort, I attempt to close off my throat, tightening every muscle in a desperate effort to block the passage. My jaw clenches, and I swallow repeatedly, trying to create a barrier with my tongue and the roof of my mouth. I canfeel the first touch of the cum as it contacts the blockade I've tried to form, but the pressure is too much. The cum begins to seep through the small gaps, the barrage of goblin seed too potent and plentiful to be held back by mere muscle contractions. Panic turns to horror as the realization dawns that I can't stop it; I can only brace for the flood.\n\nThe first contact is nothing short of catastrophic. It lands on my tongue with a tangible splat, a droplet of creamy invasion that I feel in the very marrow of my bones. The flavor hits me like a punch to the gut, an obscene cocktail of salty, musky, bleachy semen that screams of Grokk's virility. It's soul-shattering. It's everything I don't want to feel, everything I don't want to taste, everything I don't want to experience.\n\nIt's wet, slick, and hot. So blisteringly hot. It's not just warmth, it's heat. A pulsating, fervid heat that carries the imprint of Grokk's insatiable lust. I can feel it, alive and wriggling, a teeming mass of life eager to spread, to conquer. It feels like it's squirming, writhing on my tongue as if each individual sperm is alive, kicking, fighting to fertilize the first thing it touches.\n\nThe consistency of it is a new level of degradation. The hot semen rolls onto my tongue, a sticky, gooey mass that has the audacity to be chunky. It's like a perverse soup, the thick broth dotted with curdled, heavier globs that just add to the vile texture.\n\nEvery second brings a new surge, each pulse of the tube forcing more of the repugnant substance into my mouth. It's a cruel parody of intimacy, a gross mimicry of the act of passion. This is not a lover's seed. This is the result of Grokk's grunting, brutish orgasm, a tribute to his goblin potency.\n\nI try to resist, to push back against the torrent that's inching its way into my mouth, but it's useless. The sheer volume is overwhelming, steadily pushing against my closed throat, demanding to be let in. It fills my mouth, stretching my cheeks, invading my senses.\n\nMy cheeks are flushed, burning from the heat.\n\nI try to hold it in my mouth, keep it from sliding down my throat. But the pressure is relentless, and with each passing second, the task becomes more impossible. The taste is so overpowering it's hard to think, hard to focus on anything else.\n\nDespite my best efforts, I can't keep it from happening. The pressure becomes too much, the disgusting liquid threatening to spill from my lips. With a whimper of despair, I finally swallow for the first time.\n\nThe sensation of it sliding down my throat is one I'll never forget. The thick, sludgy substance leaves a burning trail in its wake, filling my stomach with warmth. I can feel it churning in my gut, its heat radiating through me.\n\nWith the first swallow, something shifts in me. It's subtle at first, but it soon becomes impossible to ignore. A foggy haze settles over my thoughts, dulling my senses. My body feels heavy, as though I'm sinking into the cushioned bench beneath me.\n\nAs the slimy goblin spunk continues to fill my mouth, and as I continue to swallow, the sensation grows. A tingling that starts in my skin and slowly spreads throughout my body. It's like I'm being filled from the inside, the virile cum seeping into every part of me.\n\nI can't think. The taste, the smell, the warmth of it - it's all too much. The tent ceiling spins over my head, my body humming with a foreign energy that's both invigorating and terrifying.\n\nThe last burst of Grokk's cum dribbles into the funnel as his massive orgasm concludes. Even from a distance, the heady musk of his virility saturates the air, his goblin seed potently strong, stinging my nostrils.\n\n[Choice: Grokk leaves you alone with your 'meal'.",

He grunts, amused at my desperate plight, then exits the tent with one of his slave girls. The blonde one, her eyes half lidded and mouth curved into a coquettish smile, leaves with him, looking back over her shoulder to tell me, \"Enjoy your meal, honey.\"\n\nI'm left with the brunette, her curvaceous figure scantily dressed in a gauzy outfit that leaves little to the imagination. She lifts the funnel, securing it high on the bedpost, the tube still heavy with Grokk's potent sperm - I’ve hardly made a dent in the supply. Then, she crouches next to me, her eyes wide with sadistic excitement as goblin cum continues to pump into my mouth.\n\n\"Just relax,\" she coos, her voice drips with false empathy. \"You're going to love it eventually, I promise. The taste of his gobbo goo… it's like nothing else. So potent, so virile.\"\n\nAnother dollop of goblin seed enters my mouth, my taste buds assaulted by its distinct flavor - heady, salty, bitter with a tangy, bleach-like aftertaste. It's nauseatingly hot. It's just been brewed in the goblin's hefty balls, and oozes onto my tongue in a sickening wave.\n\nOverwhelmed, I choke, but the brunette just giggles, \"Oh, you'll get used to it, darling. Take it slow.\"\n\nThe gelatinous texture sticks to my teeth, the roof of my mouth. The flavor is complex, potent, overwhelming. Salty, metallic, a hint of a pungent goblin aroma that fills my nose.\n\nIt invades my senses, my throat clenching as the next mouthful forces itself down. My stomach churns as the hot, wriggling mass settles there. But there's more to come, and the next mouthful is easier, the one after easier still.\n\nThe girl coos words of encouragement as I continue to swallow, \"That's it, Elise. Swallow it all down. Savor the taste. Feel the heat of it, the virility. Mmm, so thick, so creamy. It's divine, isn't it?\"\n\nMy mind is getting foggy as the pheromones work their insidious magic, my body growing increasingly hot. My nipples harden again against the cold air, my lower belly starts to thrum with unwanted arousal. The heat rises in my chest, a dull ache begins to form between my legs, a feeling I can't ignore.\n\nEach swallow becomes more natural, more automatic. The flavor becomes less overwhelming, more familiar. Each mouthful brings an increase in my temperature, a fogging of my mind, an arousal of my senses.\n\nAll the while, the girl's voice is a constant background hum, her words starting to blur and fade into the background as the fog of arousal grows thicker, \"Yes, Elise, that's it. Take it all in. It's not so bad, is it? You're doing so well... Smaller mouthfuls… bigger gulps…”\n\nThe wetness between my legs grows, a trickle of moisture slipping from my pussy. Arousal, not of my own making, forces itself upon me, making me squirm in my bonds. My skin flushes, a heat sweeping over my body, as the last bit of the goblin's seed slides down my throat. My nipples are pebbles against the cold air, my pussy aching, wet and wanting.\n\nMy body betrays me, my mind is in turmoil. The goblin's cum is a burning, wriggling mass in my stomach. It's seeping into me, changing me, marking me. His taste lingers in my mouth, the sickly-sweet scent of his seed fills my nose. The heat in my belly spreads to my chest, to my breasts, making my nipples tighten more, my pussy clench around nothingness.\n\nBut there's no release, no relief from the building tension. I'm trapped here, exposed, humiliated, filled with goblin seed. The taste of it lingers in my mouth, the memory of its heat, its texture, its potency forever imprinted in my mind.\n\nThe brunette's words become a distant echo as I lie there, panting, flushed. My mind is foggy, my senses overwhelmed. The heat of the goblin's seed burns inside me, marking me, branding me. I'm his now, whether I want it or not.\n\nThe pressure in the stream relaxes finally… I don’t even know how much I’ve consumed. Though my stomach has gone from empty to full, so it must have been a lot…\n\nThe brunette girl leans back, a satisfied smile on her lips as she watches me. Her eyes are wide, filled with perverse delight, \"That's it, Elise. You did so well. You took it all in. You're one of us now. One of Grokk's girls.\"\n\nI can only groan in response, the taste of Grokk's seed still strong on my tongue, the heat burning intensely in my belly.\n\nI feel the brunette girl’s hands touch me, drawn to my heat between my legs, like a moth to a flame.\n\n\"Look at you. All ready and wet. Bet you're already halfway to being in heat.\" The words resonate within me, a perverse affirmation. A slow dread spreads, mingling with the mounting, unwanted desire.\n\nHer fingers drift over my pussy, tracing a path through the wetness pooled there, and I gasp. The feel of her fingers against me, a jolt of electricity.\n\nThe brunette's thumb finds my clit and begins to stroke it in a circular motion. Her touch is gentle, yet insistent, and I can't suppress a groan, muffled by the tube still fastened to my mouth. My back arches off the cushioned platform, body jerking involuntarily.\n\n\"There you go,\" she croons, \"just enjoy it.\"\n\nShe doesn't penetrate me - that, as she reminds me with a salacious grin, is Grokk's privilege. But her touch is enough to ignite a fire inside me. The heat from the goblin king's seed in my belly, the tormenting touch on my clit, it's a potent combination that makes my body react in a way I don't want it to. Each swirl of her thumb sends sparks shooting through my lower belly, tightening something deep inside me.\n\nMy legs, splinted and healing, tremble on their restraints. They're mostly healed, but the pain is still there, a dull throb that underpins the waves of unwanted pleasure. The pain is grounding, a tether in the overwhelming sea of sensation.\n\nMy body is on display, splayed out, voluptuous and bouncy as ever. My breasts, heavy and flushed with heat, jiggle with each labored breath I take. My nipples are hard under the chill of the air, goosebumps breaking out across my skin.\n\n\"You're going to make such a wonderful mommy to Grokk's pups,\" she whispers, her voice laced with a cruel, gleeful anticipation. Her words hit me like a punch to the gut.\n\nThe tension builds, a tempest in the pit of my stomach, and it's unbearable. My toes curl, my fingers grip the restraints. Every touch, every stroke, pushes me closer to the edge. It's a precipice I don't want to cross, but my body has other ideas.\n\nMy moans, stifled by the tube in my mouth, cause the last remnants of Grokk's seed to trickle into my mouth. Each drop, cooled by now, cements the reality of my situation. I'm being made ready, prepared for Grokk.\n\nThe brunette keeps up her steady rhythm on my clit, her fingers slick with my arousal. Each pass of her thumb fans the flames inside me. Each whispered word of praise twists the knife in my gut. It's obscene, perverse, and yet I can't ignore the pull of it.\n\nAs my body teeters on the edge, I feel an unstoppable force barreling towards me. A crashing wave, inevitable. My muscles tighten, an uncontrollable tension building, demanding release.\n\nThe brunette's touch becomes my world, my universe. It's just her fingers on my clit, just her words in my ears, and the taste of Grokk's seed in my mouth. That's when it hits me. My body convulses as the orgasm rips through me, tearing a squeal from my throat. It's a pathetic, desperate sound, muffled by the tube still lodged in my mouth. I bite down on it, the rubber yielding under the force of my clenching jaw.",

My entire body tenses, fighting against the natural response to her skilled touches.\n\n\"You can try all you want, Elise, but we both know how this will end,\" the slave girl giggles, her fingers now slipping slightly inside.\n\nMy breath hitches, a small whimper escapes despite my efforts. The heat inside me rises, a burning, all-consuming fire that threatens to overcome my resistance. Each of her touches sends sparks flying through my nervous system, my body on high alert, sensitized to every little sensation.\n\nI feel the goblin sperm leaking down my throat, alive and wriggling, the perverse warmth spreading from my belly to every extremity. It’s a sensation I can't ignore, a physical invasion coupled with a chemical onslaught that tears down my mental barriers.\n\nThe brunette whispers, \"Relax, let it happen. It's *inevitable*, cutie.\"\n\nI try to scream, but the goblin seed muffles my voice, my body convulsing under the strain of the climax. It's a squirting, shaking, utterly degrading eruption of pleasure paired with an intense clenching of my stomach around the nauseatingly warm load inside.\n\nThe sound of my juices hitting the floor mixes with their giggling. She scoops some of the goblin seed with her fingers, smearing it over my swollen clit, increasing the intensity of my spasms.\n\n\"There she goes!\" cheers the brunette, her voice filled with a perverse glee as she watches me unravel under her ministrations.]Every muscle in my body contracts, my belly clenching tight around the heat of Grokk's seed. The taste of him, strong, potent, overwhelms my senses, further intensifying the powerful tremors shaking me. It's a pleasure twisted with humiliation, underscored by a bitter sense of despair.\n\nI feel my pussy clenching, tightening, then releasing in a rush. The warm squirt of my juices hits the cold floor beneath me in a loud spatter. The brunette giggles at my display, her fingers still circling my overly sensitive clit. My body jerks at her touch, aftershocks of my climax making me twitch and shiver.\n\nIn the aftermath, I don't feel normal.\n\nA languorous warmth spreads through me. It creeps along my veins, seeping into each muscle, each fiber of my being. I feel it in my belly first, a gentle heat that stirs low and deep.\n\nI lay there, strapped and helpless on the breeding rack, my pussy still throbbing from the brunette's attention. My skin feels too tight, my curves too full. I'm a woman, a fact that seems absurd and foreign to me, mentally. Yet, I can't ignore the truth of my body, the evidence of my femininity etched in every inch of me.\n\nThe seed, thick and hot inside me, wriggles like a living thing. I can't help but imagine it, a million microscopic creatures swimming inside me, their virile potency awakening a primal response within my body. The thought both repulses and terrifies me, but there's an underlying curiosity there, a terrible fascination.\n\nMy nipples tighten again, a sensation that sends a bolt of electricity straight to my groin.\n\nA throb pulses deep within me, a low, heavy ache that feels rooted in my very core. It's a feeling that I can't quite place, a sensation that I can't properly name. My mind is foggy, my thoughts disjointed and chaotic.\n\nThe soft hum of my body feels like an inevitable surrender. The sensation is undeniable, unignorable, and yet, inexplicably tantalizing. I feel the pheromones doing their work, soothing the raging fury inside me, replacing it with a calm acceptance of my fate. A chemical seduction.\n\nI lay there, my body slowly succumbing. My belly tightens.\n\nAs I lay there, I try to think of my hatred for the goblins. But somehow, the venom, the rage, it feels diluted, subdued. It's as if the seed inside me is tampering with my emotions.\n\nA strange acceptance washes over me, a sense of being a small cog in the grand scheme of the natural order. It's a realization that feels horrifyingly inevitable, a submission to a destiny that I never asked for, and yet, find myself ensnared in. I'm not just Elise anymore, I'm a vessel, a breeding ground for the Goblin Chief’s offspring. And as I lay there, in the aftermath of my climax, I can't help but acknowledge the perverse reality of my existence.\n\nIt's a bitter pill to swallow, a gut-wrenching acceptance of a fate that feels entirely out of my hands. And yet, as I lay there, my body succumbing to the potent pheromones laced within the goblin's seed, I can't deny the dreadfully erotic undertone of it all. The heat, the ache, the readiness – it all feels so intensely feminine, so obscenely primal. And for all my despair, for all my rage, I can't help but shiver at the intensity of it all.\n\nI feel alive, in a way that feels both terrifying and exhilarating. It's a wild, raw sensation that tears through me, leaving me breathless and overwhelmed. It's an intoxicating mix of fear, anticipation, and a strange, twisted arousal that I can't quite name.\n\nAs I lay there, warmth blossoming in my lower abdomen, I can't help but wonder – is this what it feels like to be a female, a vessel of life?\n\n[Choice: Try to pray.",

But they slip from me, each syllable a memory now faded into the murky depths of my mind, swallowed up by Grokk's potent cum. Tears blur my vision, each droplet like a burning lash against my heart.\n\n\"Eon... Flux... Verge...\" My thoughts are disjointed, each name a thread unraveling from the tapestry of my faith. Their divine essence is lost in the nauseating mix of salty goblin sperm and the iron scent of my own fear. My body is a vessel not of my own spirit, but of goblin breeding and sin. I’m unable to utter their prayers, to call out for their wisdom, their change, their transcendence. All that fills me now is Grokk’s dominance, his imminent parenthood and my impending motherhood.\n\nIn the middle of this brewing storm, a tender image flickers to life. Elara. My Elara. Her face is a beacon of home, the echo of the quiet nights, entwined limbs, and the warmth of her against me. But like a wisp of smoke, the features morph and distort, swept up in the mind-altering maelstrom, the once crisp edges now blurred and distorted.\n\nHer almond eyes, always sparkling with laughter... what color were they again? Blue? No, that can't be right. Green? I can’t remember. And her hair, cascading down her back in a cascade of... was it gold or chestnut? A sob wrenches free from my constricted throat, muffled and choked by the breeding tube.\n\nDesperation claws at me, a feral beast driven mad with the knowledge of its own impending doom. My body shudders, sobs wracking my frame, causing my breasts to heave and my belly to quake. Grokk's seed, hot and virile, sloshes inside me with each shudder, a perverse reminder of my purpose.\n\nThe memory of Elara begins to fade, like sand slipping through desperate fingers. Each granule, a piece of her, a piece of us, a piece of the man I used to be. The despair is a tangible weight, pressing against my breasts, sinking into the fertile warmth of my womb, a cruel mockery of the life it was preparing to harbor.\n\nMy breaths hitch and splutter, chest heaving, my bare, jiggly breasts bobbing with each sharp intake. The hot tears trickle down the sides of my face, pooling in my ears, the wet echoes filling the silence of my solitude. I am Elise. I was Aldric. I am... I am... lost.\n\n[Choice: The next day...",

      "text": "--- Chapter 10: Sympathy ---\nI wobble, my legs still weak from the lack of use. My knees buckle, but Melka's tiny arm, surprisingly strong, hooks around my waist, keeping me upright. It's so bizarre, being held up by a goblin, one of the creatures who contributed to my predicament in the first place.\n\n\"Easy there, Tit-bitch,\" she says, her voice a soft, gruff hum. \"Let's not have ya fall flat on yer face, eh?\"\n\nEach step feels like my legs are made of jelly, wobbling and unsure. My muscles strain, aching in protest as they're forced back into use. I can feel the tug of newly healed tissue, the sting of it stretching after being so long immobilized. It's odd, feeling the strength return, the strange mix of soreness and relief, the odd sensation of feeling something that shouldn't feel so alien.\n\n\"Hold onto me,\" Melka instructs, her voice stern yet encouraging. \"Don't rush it.\"\n\nI do as she says, my hand gripping her tiny, firm shoulder for support. She smells of earth and herbs, a strange mix that isn't exactly unpleasant.\n\n\"You've gotta build up strength again,\" she explains, leading me along a worn dirt path. \"Can't be all flimsy when you're heavy with pups.\"\n\nThe mention of 'pups' causes a shiver of revulsion to ripple through me. The image of Grokk, the memory of him and his disgusting seed, is like a punch to the gut. Yet, there's a weird warmth in my belly, a glowing ember that's both foreign and terrifying.\n\nIt feels... strange. I'm not supposed to enjoy this, not supposed to feel good. My mind screams at the injustice of it all, at the memories that seem to fade and slip like water through fingers. I was Aldric. I had a wife, Elara. But those thoughts, those memories, they seem so distant, so foggy.\n\n\"We'll get you there, Tit-bitch,\" Melka assures me, her voice oddly soothing. \"One step at a time, eh?\"\n\nIt's hard to reconcile this kind, almost nurturing goblin with the harsh, brutal world that's been forced upon me. But then, maybe that's just the goblin seed talking, muddying my thoughts, pushing me further into complacency.\n\n\"Good girl,\" Melka praises, a small, pleased smile curving her lips. \"See? Ya can do it.\"\n\nThere's a twinge in my heart, a sting of pain that cuts through the foggy warmth. This isn't right. This isn't me. I'm not some breeding cow, some creature to be used and discarded.\n\nBut as Melka leads me through the enclosed series of tents belonging to Grokk, her small form a strange comfort amidst the chaos, I can't help but feel a glimmer of hope. Despite the horrors, despite the fear, I'm still here, standing once again.\n\n\"Ya looked shocked when ya saw me, Tit-bitch,\" Melka chuckles, her eyes sparkling with mischief. \"Didn't think there'd be lady goblins?\"\n\n\"I... I didn't,\" I admit, trying to organize my thoughts, my words slurring together.\n\nMelka laughs, a throaty chuckle that echoes through the trees. \"Aye, we're rare. One in fifty, thereabouts. The lads don't pay us much mind, too busy drooling over human women. But we pop out occasionally.”\n\nMy face heats at that, an uncomfortable reminder of my current predicament. Melka seems to notice, giving my hip a sympathetic pat.\n\n\"So, how'd ya end up here, Tit-bitch?\" she asks, tilting her head curiously. When she calls me by my arena name, it’s said almost kindly, affectionately.\n\nI hesitate, considering lying, considering saying anything but the truth. But looking at Melka, at her small form that's been nothing but supportive since we started this... this journey, I decide to take a chance.\n\n[Choice: Might as well tell her the truth...",

Ya really are full of surprises.\"\n\nI nod, swallowing past the lump in my throat. \"I was cursed. By a goblin named Snib.\"\n\nMelka cocks her head to the side, brows furrowed. \"Never heard of 'em. He a shaman?”\n\nI shake my head. \"No, just a regular goblin. But he found this collar, this artifact.\"\n\n\"And that's why ol’ Grouz couldn't get it off ya,\" Melka murmurs, her fingers tapping against her chin thoughtfully. “Here I thought he was just a dimwit. Ya reckon ya can even have kids? With ya being a man and all. Underneath, I mean.”\n\nI shrug, the thin material of my gown slipping off my shoulder. It's silky, clingy, every breeze a whisper against my skin. Barefoot, I can feel the roughness of the ground, the occasional sharp pebble underfoot.\n\n\"I... I don't know,\" I admit, my voice shaky.\n\nMelka gives my ass a firm pat, the impact making my flesh jiggle. \"Well, ya certainly look ripe enough. Them hips are begging for a nice, round belly.\"\n\nAnd for now, that's enough to keep me going, to keep me pushing through the fog in my mind, to keep putting one foot in front of the other.\n\n\"Steady on, Tit-bitch,\" Melka gruffs, her firm grip steadying me as we hobble towards a canvas tent in the distance.\n\nThe scent of goblin jizz wafts through the air from another tent, sweet and sickly, making my mind swim and my belly clench in a peculiar, throbbing pulse. A tingling warmth flows down into my pelvis, lacing me with an oddly soothing sense of submission.\n\n\"You ever thought of having babies, Melka?\" I find myself asking, my voice soft, tender. Trying to distract myself from my own situation.\n\nMelka chortles, a sound like gravel rolling down a hill. \"Me? Nah. Boys don't look my way. Too busy with human lasses like yaself.\"\n\n\"You're beautiful, though,” I blurt out before I can stop myself. My mind is hazy, but I know what I'm saying is true. Her features are alien, but charming in their own way. Her upturned nose, bouncy curls, and yellow but straight teeth, all contribute to an uncanny but adorable attractiveness.\n\nMelka just shrugs, her green cheeks flushing a darker hue. \"Doesn't change the fact that gobbo girls are a dead end, in nature. Goblin boys breed human girls. That's how it works.\"\n\n\"But what if you left?\" I ask. The words slip out without thought. \"There are cities like Thuulk that are more accepting of other races.\"\n\nShe chuckles, but it sounds hollow. \"What, and risk getting skewered on sight?\"\n\nI recoil, a lump forming in my throat. The thought of Melka getting hurt, just for being who she is... it's sad. I quickly change the topic. It’s one that’s been burning in my mind.\n\n\"Is... Is it true about Grokk? About his... his babies being... dangerous?”\n\nMelka's expression tightens, a single nod confirming my worst fears. \"His whelps are large, multiple... Last one didn't survive. One before got paralyzed. The one before that only bore two pups. Sometimes he squirts as much as eight in ya.”\n\nMy heart drops into my stomach, a wave of dread washing over me. \"But... But I...\"\n\nShe looks at me, her eyes softening. \"You're different, Tit-bitch. Grokk's previous broodmares were slender. Grouz convinced him to pick someone with... more meat to them,\" she says, running a finger along my wide hips. The sheer fabric of my dress clings to my body, my plump breasts, my big ass... all on display, all designed for... breeding.\n\n[Choice: Grokk's cum is affecting your mind...",

Cause no one else will. It's not right, what we do to human women. But it's how nature intends it now. That’s the cruel fact. That's why there's only one goblin woman in fifty. The gobbo bloodline is passed through human mothers, and the babies... they're all gobbo. Not half and half.”\n\nA sense of acceptance settles over me, replacing the raw terror. I am to be Grokk's breeding mare. And somehow... somehow, it doesn't feel as wrong as it once did. It feels... natural.\n\n\"Alright, Tit-bitch, sit here,\" Melka directs, guiding me into the large slave tent with her bony goblin hands. The warm smell of oiled hair and the chatter of female voices fills the space. My still tender legs wobble beneath me, but I manage to perch on a low stool with Melka's help.\n\nA woman approaches, heavily pregnant, her belly round and protruding beneath her transparent, form-fitting gown. Her dark nipples are hard to miss, stark against the pale sheer fabric. She settles herself behind me, and I feel her cool, milk-soaked fingertips run through my long raven hair.\n\nShe starts with a quick comb through, disentangling the knots with her long fingers. Her touch is gentle, and it’s almost soothing. I can see her heavily pregnant belly jiggle with her movements, the fabric of her dress stretched thin across it. Her breasts, plump and lactating, press against her dress, the soaked patches cold on her warm skin. It feels like hours as she meticulously separates my hair into sections, the soft whispers of her hands brushing against my scalp soothing my frazzled mind.\n\nHer fingers deftly start braiding the sections, her movements swift and precise, the braid taking shape rapidly. I can feel the tug of my scalp as she pulls the braids tighter, a sensation not unpleasant but rather grounding. The final step, she secures my braids high on my head, using delicate gold clips that glimmer in the dim tent light. They look expensive, more royal than slave-like. A strange sight in a slave tent. My reflection stares back at me from a polished copper mirror, my styled hair looking almost regal, jarring against my sheer dress and swollen breasts.\n\nMelka, standing at the entrance of the tent, grunts her approval. “Tit-bitch, your legs might feel funny now, but they're nearly mended,” she says, her goblin accent thick, her words a little slurred. “Try to stretch them when you can, it helps.”\n\nMy mind is a whirlwind of confusion and fear. I should be resisting, I should be fighting against their preparations for Grokk's pleasure. But the more I struggle, the more his cum coursing through me seems to dull my resistance, creating a warm, pliant haze.\n\nMelka, as if sensing my confusion, tries to distract me. \"So, your master, Snib, stays near the fighting ring, right?\" I nod, feeling a strange pang of loss. Snib, as crude and demanding as he was, is a known entity. Grokk is an unknown.\n\n\"Ha, poor Snib,\" Melka scoffs, her yellow teeth flashing in a wide grin. \"Losing his prized Tit-bitch to Grokk must've hurt. He'll have to make do with his other slaves.\"\n\n“He doesn’t have any more,” I say.\n\n“Ah. Only cause of the collar, huh?”\n\nThe mention of my collar sparks a small glimmer of hope. \"Yes, Snib... he could release me. Remove this collar, and I... I might change back,\" I mumble, my words echoing strangely in the tent. “Into Aldric.”\n\n“Aldric,” Melka snorts. “Weird name. Let’s keep calling you Tit-bitch.”\n\n[Choice: They get you dressed...",

The room is bathed in the warm, flickering glow of braziers, casting eerie, dancing shadows that twist and contort on the walls. The air is thick with the smell of roasted boar, the heady aroma of brewed rotgut ale, and the underlying musk of male goblins that I’m unfortunately quite sensitive to.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Grokk, the goblin king, sits at the head of the table. He's a grotesque spectacle of goblin masculinity - broad, muscled, and intimidating. His enormous, veiny cock is barely concealed by his royal loincloth, the bulge a lewd display of his virility. There's an undeniable authority about him, an aura of power that silences the room as Melka and I approach.\n\nAs Grokk's heated gaze lands on me, I can't help but shudder. There's something primal, something animalistic in his eyes that sends a chill down my spine. His snarl is thunderous, echoing in the grand hall. \"What is THIS, Grouz?\" he roars, his eyes flashing dangerously. \"I TOLD you to keep the Tit-bitch locked in the BREEDING RACK!”\n\nGrouz, the wizened shaman, trembles as he replies, \"M- Melka insisted, my Lord. She feared for the human's healing legs.\"\n\nGrokk's roar is deafening. \"I don't give a rat's ass about her fucking legs! I wanted her on display, not dolled up like my fucking wife!\" He slams his fist on the table, making the silverware clatter. \"She's supposed to be a breeding slut, not some high-born human! I wanted her cunt for all to see!\"\n\nThe dining hall falls silent, the goblins staring in shock at their king's rage. Even Krognar, the hulking troll, ceases his guffawing to watch.\n\n\"But look at her, boss!\" Melka interjects, her husky voice trembling slightly. \"She's so... fucking hot!\"\n\nGrokk scoffs, \"She's not broken in yet. I'm not going to risk my royalty being questioned by an un-broken slave!\"\n\nMelka persists, but it earns her a brutal backhand from Grokk. The force of the blow sends her sprawling, a small whimper escaping her lips.\n\n\"Stupid bitch!\" Grokk growls, his voice echoing through the hall. \"You have no place here. I've put up with your antics for far too long. Goblin women don't understand the needs of goblin men. Humans are breeding stock, and you are NOTHING!”\n\nHis words hang heavy in the air, his cruelty palpable. Melka is on the floor, her eyes welling with tears as blood trickles from her nose.",

The room seems to freeze as I drop to my knees before him, my heart pounding in my chest. My gown pools around me, the slits revealing the generous swell of my hips, my ass sticking out provocatively as I prostrate myself. \"Please,\" I beg, my voice trembling. \"I will... I will please you. I... I'll be a good slave.\"\n\nThere's a beat of silence, the room holding its breath as Grokk stares down at me, his eyes burning into my soul. Beside me, Melka watches in stunned silence, a glimmer of hope flickering in her eyes.\n\nThe grand dining hall of the goblin king erupts into crude laughter as Grokk, the crude yet regal goblin chieftain, issues his command.\n\n\"Well then, give me a fuckin' blowjob, Tit-bitch.\" His voice is a coarse bark that grates my ears, but it's his words, not the tone, that make my heart pound in dread.\n\nMelka's purple eyes meet mine across the room, her pleading gaze seared into my memory. Yesterday's taste of Grokk's seed, still so vivid on my tongue, stirs up a storm of revulsion, fear, and that shameful spark in the pit of my stomach. The goblin king's command reverberates through the grand hall, each chuckle and catcall driving it home.]I remain motionless, my body frozen as the scene unfolds before my horrified eyes. Grokk's backhand comes down hard on Melka, who barely has time to brace herself before she’s knocked to the ground again. Her small form crumples under the brutal force, a soft whimper escaping as she tries to shield her face.\n\nThe room is a mix of tense silence and murmured disapproval from some corners, but no one dares to challenge Grokk’s authority. Melka's eyes, brimming with tears and pain, meet mine across the room. In her gaze, there's a silent plea, a call for help that I'm too terrified to answer.\n\nGrokk, seething with rage, points a gnarled finger at the goblin men near her. \"Lock her up,\" he bellows, his voice echoing ominously in the hall. \"Let her rot until she learns her place!\"\n\nTwo burly goblins grab Melka by the arms, dragging her away. She struggles feebly, her eyes locked with mine until she's forcibly pulled out of sight. The visual of her being taken away, helpless and hurt, is etched into my mind, a stark reminder of the cruel world I'm trapped in.\n\nGrokk turns his fiery gaze upon me, his eyes gleaming with a malicious intent. \"And you,\" he growls, stepping closer until Heat radiates from his massive form. \"Give me a fuckin' blowjob, Tit-bitch. Show me you can at least be good for somethin'.\"\n\n[Choice: Approach him.",

I can feel the prickle of dozens of lust-filled gazes crawling over my exposed skin. The dedicated metal rings in my dress allow my tits to bounce freely with each step, each jiggle drawing another wave of lecherous hoots.\n\nA low growl rips through the room when a goblin reaches out to cop a feel. \"Hands off, she's mine!\" Grokk roars, his barked command immediately obeyed. As I approach him, I see a smug grin spread over his gnarled face. It's a look of conquest, a look of power. He's loving every moment of this.\n\nTwo human slave girls scurry to place a plush cushion by Grokk's feet. As I slowly lower myself onto the cushion, my aching legs protest each movement. The pain, sharp and stabbing, ripples up through my thighs, but it’s a dull throb compared to the dread knotting my stomach.\n\nAround the table, there’s raucous laughter, the clinking of mugs, snatches of bawdy goblin songs filling the cavernous dining hall, as if nothing unusual was happening. Like the king's whore wasn't about to get her face stuffed with a cock under the royal dining table. But under here, the sounds are muted, distant echoes that lend an unreal quality to my shame, the noises reduced to a low, mocking hum in the background of my situation.\n\nBeneath Grokk's heavy, royal wooden table, his two meaty thighs open up, making room for me. I can see his bulging loincloth, the monstrous beast underneath straining at the thin fabric, seeking release. The sight makes my heart pound in my chest, the rhythmic thrumming echoing in my ears. It's like I'm staring at the barrel of a loaded cannon.\n\nTimidly, my trembling hands reach up, my fingers ghosting over the warm, taut fabric of the loincloth, each heartbeat of his cock sending ripples across the bulge. I can feel him - hot, throbbing, throbbing with insane virility. It's intimidating, dominating, a stark reminder of the raw power contained within.\n\nDrawing in a shuddering breath, I slowly push the loincloth aside.\n\nThe thing that springs free is monstrous. His cock unfurls like a spring-loaded weapon, a thick, grotesque battering ram. Sixteen inches of veiny goblin meat slaps against my forehead, draping heavily over my head, nestling between my high ponytails. The harsh thud of it sends a shockwave through me, a stark reminder of the potent, breeding tool I'm about to service. A hot spurt of precum jets out, a viscous rivulet of arousal that trickles down my neck, slithering along the curve of my spine.\n\nThe hot stream trickles along the bare skin of my back, slipping beneath my dress, soaking into the thin fabric of my gown. It snakes down, seeping between the cleft of my ass cheeks, searing a wet path that makes me squirm in discomfort and secret delight. I let out a soft whimper, the obscene heat of his precum soaking through the fabric of my gown, and staining my skin beneath.\n\nMy body responds, a pulsating throb of desire coiling low in my belly, a damp heat pooling between my thighs. My nipples harden further, the cold metal tassels of my dress chafing against them, each jingle echoing the rhythm of my quickened breaths.\n\nEvery moment, every sensation, only serves to further Grokk's dominance over me. The weight of his monstrous cock resting heavily on my head, the pungent musk of his arousal, the intimidating throb of his arousal against my slender fingers, the hot streak of his precum trickling down my back - everything reminds me of my place, of my role. His whore. His breeding bitch. The degradation stings, but it also sparks a deep, primal yearning in me, a lewd acceptance of my surrender to this potent goblin king.\n\nThe girth and heft of Grokk's cock are more than my small hands can encompass. I wrap both my palms around the hot, thick length, fingers pressing into the veins that mar the spongy, green flesh. The touch of it feels like handling some kind of primal weapon, a potent instrument of biological warfare. Even semi-hard, it's heavy enough to make my wrists ache.\n\nI scoot backward, the soft cushion beneath me groaning under my shifting weight. My legs, still mending, shoot sparks of dull pain up my spine as I move. It's a clumsy, slow effort to extricate Grokk's engorged member from the tight confines of my high ponytails. Each slight tug pulls at my scalp, making me whimper. The throbbing shaft is like an anaconda in my hands, sliding heavy and obscene from between my raven locks, the precious tresses clinging wetly to the glistening skin of his cock.\n\nAs I reposition, the immense cock falls forward, slapping against my face with a lewd thwack. A hot streak of precum trickles down my forehead, bisecting my face. The sensation of it, slick and hot, dribbling down my cheeks, makes me shudder in humiliation and something else. His cock is drooling, leaking arousal like a faucet, the lewd stream glistening on my skin, painting my face with the proof of his potency.\n\nMy body responds with a humiliating eagerness, as if primed for this shameful servitude. My massive breasts press together in the too-tight confines of my bodice, the sensitive flesh spilling out from the gold-encircled holes, nipples peaking under the pressure. Each shift of my body makes them jiggle, each jiggle reverberating through the golden tassels, setting them jingling in a lurid rhythm. The sound is sharp and crisp, an obscene counterpoint to the muffled cacophony outside.\n\nWith a soft grunt, I reposition myself on the plush cushion. My wide hips dig into the soft material, the plump globes of my ass jiggling with the movement. The dress hikes up, the soft fabric bunching at my waist. The movement exposes more of my thighs, the golden chain about my waist catching the dim light filtering in from the outside, a sensual wink of gold against my pale skin.\n\nUnder the heavy table, in this shadowy world of servitude, I position myself for the impending blowjob. My chest rises and falls in quick, shallow breaths, the gold-encased openings of my dress giving teasing peeks of my flushed cleavage with every gasp.\n\nGrokk's glans is monstrous, a veritable fruit-sized helmet of swollen, orange flesh that winks at me through its vertical slit, throbbing with each beat of his barbaric heart. It’s drastically different from the rest of his green cock, like a fiery crown atop a verdant scepter. The bulbous head is an obscene, juicy target, spattering a steady stream of putrid precum that trails a hot, slimy path down my voluptuous breasts, staining the delicate fabric of my dress and pooling in the deep valley of my cleavage.\n\nWith a shaky breath, I part my thick lips, a slow, deliberate action that somehow feels more daunting than facing a dragon. The first contact of my lips against his glans is a shock to my senses - it's scalding hot, twitching against my lips. I whimper at the contact, the brutal reality of what I'm about to do flooding my senses.\n\nThen, I wrap my lips around it.\n\n[Choice: Start sucking.",

My jaw strains painfully, the flesh stretching to accommodate his invading girth. My mouth aches, each passing second quite agonizing, each movement a reminder of the debauchery I've been reduced to. But after a few slow, gag-inducing attempts, I manage to get the head of his cock fully past my lips, the putrid taste of his precum exploding against my tongue.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nMy eyes water, the corners crinkling with the strain, but I press on, my mind foggy with the potent pheromones flooding my senses. My lips grip against the base of his glans - as far as I can go.\n\nThe muffled grunt from above tells me that Grokk is aware of my struggles. His deep, guttural voice rumbles through the wood of the table, the vibrations reaching down to where I'm splayed in obscene submission. As he grunts, he twitches, his cock-head growing another side, opening my strained jaw up even more.\n\n\"No teeth, Tit-bitch,\" he warns, his words a chilling promise of further punishment should I disobey. I whimper around his cock, the sound muffled by the invading length.\n\nThe taste of him is objectively vile, an affront to my senses. Each twitch of his cock, each fresh hot spurt of precum is a test of my resolve, a battle against my gag reflex. I force myself to swallow it down, the musky essence sliding lazily down my throat. Each bob of my head is a struggle, the taste of him a salty reward for my efforts.\n\nI can feel the wet heat pooling between my thighs. I gurgle.\n\nMy outfit feels tighter as I shift, trying to find a more comfortable position. The tight dress hugs my curves, my tits bobbing with each movement. The bangles on my wrists jingle with each jerk of my hands, the sound mixing with the lewd, wet noises of my mouth working over his cock.\n\nThe strain in my jaw is horrific, an aching burn that is not going to subside anytime soon.\n\nThe taste is overpowering, each fresh spurt of precum a devastating assault on my senses, heating me from the inside out . It's raw, putrid, a smorgasbord of curdled goblin flavors that leave my head reeling. I grimace, trying to adapt to the taste, my tongue brushing against the throbbing underside of his massive length, exploring every pulsing vein and sweaty crevice.\n\nI try to avoid it, but my mouth gets more and more sullied with precum, the viscous liquid sliding down my throat, pooling in my stomach. The potent essence of the goblin chieftain taints me from within. My body responds to the invasion, my pussy clenching, a slick wetness building at the apex of my quivering thighs.\n\nEvery shift in my position sends ripples through my body, my breasts jiggling within the confines of the dress, my nipple tassels jingling with each weighty flop. The heavy gold chain around my waist slithers against my skin; the metal is cold against warm flush spreading across my skin.\n\nI can feel my ponytails brush against the small of my back, their gold-adorned weight tugging at my scalp with each nod of my head.\n\nTears prick at the corners of my eyes, the sting unexpected and alarming. Is it from the strain of accommodating Grokk's massive cock, or the shameful realization of what I'm doing? I don't know. All I know is that I can't stop. The slow leak of precum down my throat, the muffled grunts of satisfaction from above, they're all demanding my submission.\n\nI try to use my hands, the bangles on my wrists clinking as I grip the base of his cock. It's a daunting task, my slender fingers barely able to circle his thickness. The feel of him is tough to bear, the mammoth erection sweaty under my touch. My mind recoils at the contact, the haze of pheromones doing little to curb the feeling that I’m pleasuring a monster, an enemy of my people.\n\nThe burn in my jaw is becoming unbearable. But the fear of Grokk’s drunken wrath keeps me going, the threat of punishment for disobedience a terrifying prospect. At least I am not getting bred.\n\nI can feel the heat coiling in my lower belly, a slow simmer of want that I can't deny. My womb clenches at the thought of Grokk's virile, invasive cock intending to impregnate me. My chest tightens, a lump forming in my throat.\n\nAs I continue my shameful, slobbery task, the cacophony of the goblin feast overhead is a constant reminder of my status. The raucous laughter, the clinking of goblets, the guttural roars of conversation, they're all a testament to the depravity of this place, the Griznak Gobboree, where humans are degraded, subjugated, used.\n\nThe tent above me is alive with goblin revelry, their grotesque forms a blight on the beautiful Zaelasian landscape. Grokk, the leader of them all, sits at the head of the table, basking in his vile glory. I am merely a footnote in his story, a human plaything for his amusement.\n\nDespite the rising bile in my throat, the burning in my jaw, the shame in my heart, I don't stop. I can't stop. I'm trapped in this obscene servitude, my body a tool for the goblin king's pleasure. Every bob of my head, every lap of my tongue, every soft whimper around his cock punctuates my degradation, a silent prayer for an end that seems far out of reach.\n\nSo I continue, each sob a muffled echo in the grand tent, each tear a glistening symbol of my struggle, each spurt of precum a bitter taste of my future. And through it all, the goblin feast continues, the revelry a stark contrast to my humiliation, the sounds of pleasure a cruel mockery of my suffering.\n\nMy jaw can’t take anymore, so my tongue just laps at the sides of his length, an awkward attempt to provide him pleasure. The sour taste of his sweaty skin is nauseating, but I persevere, my face flushed with effort and humiliation. Whimpers escape me as I struggle, the sound muffled by his cock.\n\nThe shuffling of my movements causes my dress to shift on my body, my breasts jiggling within the confines of the bodice, nipple tassels chiming with every sway.\n\nFor a moment I sit back, overwhelmed.\n\nFrom above the table, muffled grunts and growls resonate, Grokk's impatience seeping into the noises he emits. The sounds grow more frequent, more agitated, a telling sign of his growing dissatisfaction. He's not pleased with my efforts, his frustration tangible in the guttural noises he makes.\n\nSuddenly, there's a violent jerk on my hair, his rough hands grabbing my ponytails. I'm pulled out from under the table with a harsh tug, my eyes watering from the sudden pain. The jeering crowd of goblins comes into view, their grotesque faces twisted in cruel amusement.\n\n\"Yer not servin' properly, bitch,\" Grokk's gruff voice booms, his words a death knell to any hope of escaping further humiliation. \"If bitches don't serve, they can be made to.\"\n\n[Choice: Oh no...",

The sensation of being pulled up by my hair is excruciating, each strand feeling like it's being ripped from its roots. My back arches from the sudden pull.\n\nThe sight of Grokk's erect cock aligning with my mouth is terrifying. It glistens with my spit and his precum. It mocks me, lewdly, for failing to please him. As I stare down at the monstrous length, the horrible reality of my situation sinks in.\n\nMy eyes are wide, I can’t even make a single sound of protest - his cock shuts me up.\n\nHis engorged member slides along my tongue, the taste of him spreading throughout my mouth.The monster prods the back of my throat. My eyes water, a strangled gasp escaping me. The audience hoots and hollers as he starts to force his way down. Down my throat.\n\nI have no choice but to swallow AROUND him, my muscles convulsing against the immense foreign intrusion.\n\nThe world begins to blur around the edges, my vision clouding as I struggle for breath.\n\nMy lungs cry out for air, but all they receive is cock.\n\nGrokk's massive length fills my mouth and throat, pressing against my windpipe, blocking my air supply thoroughly - just one more thing for him to dominate. I feel my collar tighten around my neck, its cold, metal surface pressing against the swelling skin of my throat that's stretched to its limit around his member.\n\nPanic grows within me, a primal fear taking hold as I realize I can't breathe. My vision swims, stars bursting behind my eyelids, as I fight the impending blackness threatening to engulf me. But the lack of oxygen and the onslaught of sensations are too much, and my eyes start to cross.\n\nThe jeering of the crowd becomes a distant echo as the reality of my situation settles in. I'm being used, brutally face-fucked by the goblin king in front of his minions, my body on display for their amusement. My breasts, hanging from the dedicated holes in my dress, swing wildly with each of his brutal thrusts, their movement causing the nipple-tassels to jingle louder.\n\nGrokk roars with pleasure, his grip on my ponytails tightening as he uses them to guide my head onto his cock. My body jerks with each violent thrust, my ass jiggling in time with his savage rhythm, the sight drawing cheers and applause from the watching crowd.\n\nAll I can see is the expanse of his hairy, muscled lower body as he forces himself further and further down my throat. I can feel his heavy balls swinging close my chin, as he presses and prods farther down. The jeering from the crowd seems to egg him on, their laughter and cheers pushing him to use me more ruthlessly.\n\nI catch a glimpse of Melka, her hand clamped over her mouth in horror, her eyes wide as she takes in the brutal scene. But her reaction is drowned out by the cheer of approval that rises from Krognar, the troll who defeated me in the arena. His booming laughter fills the tent.\n\nA rush of air floods my lungs as Grokk momentarily withdraws, a reprieve as fleeting as it is precious. I gasp, coughing and spluttering, drool mixed with spit and his musky precum trailing from my lips in a lewd display. My throat burns with the harsh intrusion, every swallow a reminder of the violent invasion.\n\nBut I hardly have time to catch my breath before he plunges back in, his monstrous length filling my throat once again. The hold on my ponytails tightens, and he starts to pump his cock into my mouth, forcing me to take his length deeper than before.\n\nI feel the veins on his cock, engorged with blood, sliding along the soft, sensitive tissue of my throat. The sensation is overwhelming, a cruel mix of pain and a perverse thrill that I can hardly comprehend. I feel the brutal stretch of my throat as he forces more of himself inside, the walls of my esophagus yielding under the relentless assault.\n\nHis massive balls are now properly clubbing my chin - he’s that far down. 16 inches of cock buried in my throat.\n\nHis grunts and growls of pleasure fill the air, competing with the cheers and lewd remarks from the goblin horde. \"Yeah, chief, show that bitch who's boss!\" \"Bet she's never had a real cock before!\" The cacophony of voices fuels Grokk's lust, his thrusts growing increasingly urgent, more violent.\n\n)A high-pitched squeal cuts through the noise, and I recognize Melka's voice. She's pleading with Grokk to be gentle. I can't see her, but I hear her distressed cries, a stark contrast to the jeering crowd. But her pleas are quickly silenced, drowned out by Grokk's cruel laughter and the increased vigor of his assault.\n\n]Suddenly, I feel a shift in Grokk's movements, a change in the rhythm. His grunts grow louder, more animalistic, his words harsh and guttural as he roars out his dominance. \"TIME FOR YOUR DINNER, HUMAN!\"\n\nHis cock twitches violently inside me, the convulsive throb stretching my throat. It's buried deep, so deep that it feels as though it's lodged directly in my stomach. And then it happens: the first pulse of his climax.\n\n[Choice: He cums.",

The sensation is indescribable, a horrifying mix of repulsion and a twisted, perverse thrill that I can't quite suppress. Each jet is a physical force, a pressure that fills me in a way I never thought possible.\n\nMy ears ring with the muffled sounds of his ejaculations, the sounds distorted by the obscene length of his cock buried in my throat. The feeling of his hot, putrid cum filling me is nauseating, an intimate invasion.\n\nYet, there's a part of me that responds to the onslaught, a primal, base reaction that I can't control. Despite my mental protestations, I can feel a flush of heat coursing through me, a perverse arousal that spreads outward from my fast-filling stomach, to the rest of my body. My toes curl, my nipples throb.\n\nHis cock continues to spasm, twitching and pulsating as it continues to pump his seed into me. The sensation of being so brutally stretched by his massive member, the crude violation of my throat, is a perverse reality I struggle to accept. My throat clenches around his cock, milking it, the muscles instinctively reacting to the harsh invasion.\n\n(:\"ch10/xray.mp4\")\n\nAnother jolt of pleasure courses through my body. I can’t stop it.\n\nGrokk's cum is hot and thick, filling my stomach with an uncomfortable warmth. Each throb of his cock delivers more of the putrid substance, the pressure of it creating a perverse bulge in my throat.\n\nFinally, Grokk withdraws from my throat, his massive, cum-spurting cock sliding up and out with a wet, obscene squelch. With a gasp that comes out more like a desperate wheeze, I gulp in mouthfuls of air, the freedom to breathe suddenly a luxury. My throat feels stretched and raw, like I've swallowed an iron rod coated in sandpaper.\n\nI take in as much air as I possibly can, gasping. For a single second, I feel numbly incredible.\n\nMy stomach is another story. The sensation of being so incredibly full, of carrying around what feels like a gallon of hot, wriggling goblin cum in my belly, is indescribable. My body feels heavy, overstuffed, the heat radiating from my distended tummy intense. It's a wet, slimy heat, squelching and jostling with each breath I take. I can feel the goblin seed wriggling inside me, as if it's alive, turning and churning in my stomach, the sensations of it writhing only intensifying the intense arousal continuing to flood my system.\n\nPussy juice dribbles down my leg as Grokk completes his long, grunting orgasm.\n\nThe last few spurts of his obscene climax take me by surprise. One heavy, sloppy spurt splatters against my chest, drenching the deep green of my bodice with thick, off-white cum. It runs down in rivulets, soaking into the fabric, turning it translucent, ruining the lustrous sheen. Another spurt goes higher, streaking across my face, getting into my eyes. The stinging is immediate and fierce, forcing my eye closed as it pastes my lashes together.\n\nHis last spurt dislodges one of my nipple tassels, the heavy cum overwhelming the adhesive holding it to my breast. The tassel falls, revealing my bare nipple, the aureola painted with a glaze of cum. The crowd of goblins roars with laughter, their cheers echoing in the tent as they revel in my utter ruin.\n\n\"Tomorrow, I breed you, human,\" Grokk snarls, wiping his slimy, deflating cock across my forehead. His words send a shudder of revulsion through me, but they also send a spark of heat to my pussy. The effects of the pheromone-laden cum, combined with the degradation of the ordeal, war inside me, creating a bitter dichotomy between my mind and body. I want to scream, to fight, to resist, but my body craves more. My body enjoys it, throbbing in a carnal rhythm that matches the pulse of Grokk's cum in my belly.\n\nI stand there, feeling utterly pathetic, my quite expensive gown thoroughly ruined.\n\n)[[Choice: Melka rushes over...][[Choice: You're led away...]",

They reach out with their gnarled, dirty hands, grasping my arms and yanking me up to my feet.\n\n\"Looks like the chief fed her good,\" one attendant leers, giving my belly, distended with the weight of Grokk's vile seed, a rough poke that forces a gasp from my lips. The other joins in with a snicker, his fingers cruelly tweaking my exposed nipple.\n\n\"Enough to keep the bitch quiet for a while,\" the second adds, his filthy hand sliding down the fabric of my gown to grope between my legs crudely. The unwanted touch is a blunt reminder of my complete helplessness and the reality of what my body is being conditioned for.\n\nHumiliated, violated, and exhausted, I stumble along between them, each step a painful reminder of the ordeal my body has endured.\n\nThey roughly strap me back into the breeding rack, the cold leather of the restraints biting into my bruised wrists and ankles. The hardness of the rack against my back feels unforgiving, a solid reminder of the physical and emotional confinement I am subjected to. As they fasten each buckle, their fingers linger, pinching and pulling at my skin with sadistic glee.\n\n\"Sleep well, breeder,\" one of the attendants sneers, giving my cheek a pat that feels more like a slap. \"Tomorrow is gonna be fun.\"\n\nThe sound of their laughter fades as they walk away, leaving me alone in the dimly lit tent. The weight of the goblin seed inside me is a heavy, squirming presence, a constant physical reminder of my degradation. The air around me is thick with the stench of sweat, seed, and despair.\n\nAs the reality of my situation envelops me, a profound exhaustion drags at my consciousness. Despite the whirlwind of fear, disgust, and reluctant arousal churning within me, sleep begins to creep up, insidious and inevitable. The mental fight to maintain clarity and purpose blurs as the pheromones in Grokk's seed start their sinister work, clouding my thoughts, dulling my emotions.\n\nMy eyelids grow heavy, the effort to keep them open too much to bear. The last vestiges of resistance fade, and I find myself slipping into a dark, uneasy sleep.]But I am not left alone in this state of disgrace. Melka rushes to my side.\n\nShe wraps an arm around me, guiding me out of the room. \"Come on,” she grunts, giving me a look of sympathy. \"Let's get you into a bath.\"\n\nI hobble beside her, our journey taking us to a large tent erected on the outskirts of the royal cluster. The bathing tent is crude, an afterthought in the grand scheme of goblin civilization, yet it represents salvation in my current state. Slave girls immediately block our path, their eyes taking in my cum-soaked appearance.\n\nTypically in goblin society, cum is not to be so quickly cleaned off, but rather allowed to sit. But Melka, fierce and protective, snarls at them. \"Grokk asked for it,\" she lies smoothly, and the slave girls immediately back off, their eyes wide with fear.\n\nWith the path clear, the goblin girl leads me into the tent.\n\nThe first thing to go is the sticky dress. It peels away from my body with a disgusting squelch, cum-soaked fabric leaving a trail of sticky residue on my skin. The ruined dress lands in a heap on the floor, its lewd adornments hanging limply. My sandals are next, a gloppy mass of cum pooling in the soles, leaving sticky footprints on the floor.\n\nUnder Melka's patient ministrations, I'm soon completely naked, the air in the tent cool against my cum-slicked skin. My belly is heavily distended with Grokk's cum, and I can't help but feel a twinge of arousal, the goblin pheromones fogging my brain. My body, despite the degradation and the pain, reacts in ways I'd rather it didn't, heat continuing to radiate low in my abdomen.\n\nSoreness laces my throat, the echo of Grokk's monstrous cock throbbing with every swallow. The remnants of his domination linger on my skin, matting my hair, and filling my belly with a warmth that radiates obscenely outward. With a sob, I lower myself into the bath, the water steaming and slightly goblin-scented but welcome nonetheless. My high ponytails float, a gross strand of cum dangles from one, streaking my face. The sensation of the water against my cum-slicked skin is soothing and discomforting in equal measure.\n\nA gentle touch against my shoulders breaks me from my thoughts. Melka, her upturned nose wrinkled in sympathy, her purple eyes glowing in the candlelight, begins to cleanse me. The throbbing pain in my legs eases slightly, my wide hips spreading out in the water, my fat ass nestling into the tub's curved bottom, the heat soothing the ache.\n\n“Thank you, Tit-bitch,\" she says, in earnest, “for saving my hide. Ya suffered for it.”\n\nHer words prompt fresh tears to spill from my eyes, sliding down my cheeks to join the bathwater. My hands drift down to my distended belly, the skin stretched and hot from the massive load of goblin cum pumped into it. I press down, hoping to expel some of it, but the dominant, virile semen stays put, wriggling inside me, asserting its claim. I feel it permeating my body, seeping into every corner, sullying me even more. It's the second load in two days, my sanity buckling under the weight of the obscene cum-meals.\n\nMelka's hands are in my hair now, the goblin girl barking orders at the slave girls loitering around the tent. She's washing the strands, combing through the sticky mess Grokk left behind. Several hairs fall out in the process, the roots screaming in protest from their rough treatment earlier. As she works, my big breasts bobble in the water, floating and bumping against my belly.\n\nThe feeling is disconcertingly feminine, a reminder of my transformed body, and I find myself strangely attuned to the sensation now. But the descending haze, the potent goblin pheromones, keeps me from dwelling too much on it, the woozy heat spreading outwards, making my body tingle with arousal, a sensation that fills me with an equal measure of shame and yearning.\n\nFresh from the bath, my skin glows under the dim torchlight. The haze of goblin pheromones permeates everything, it's like I can almost taste it. My body pulses with arousal, the sensation intensifying with each passing second.\n\nMelka's voice, husky and low, filters through the fog in my mind. She asks me something, but her words come as distant echoes, and I just blink at her, my mossy-green eyes lidded and unfocused. My hands reach for the loaf of bread she offers, but the thought of eating something othernthan cum makes my stomach churn uncomfortably.\n\nWith a sigh, Melka guides me away from the bath, her strong hand wrapped around my elbow, steadying my unsteady gait. The heat of arousal feels as though it's seeping into my bones, suffusing my being with an obscene desire that I can't shake off, no matter how hard I try. It's like a wildfire, slowly consuming my mind, leaving only carnal lust in its wake.\n\nThe sight of the breeding rack fills me with dread, yet a perverse anticipation bubbles up within me. As Melka gently eases me onto it, my heart races, and I can't help the gasp that escapes my lips as the cool metal touches my skin.\n\n\"I'm sorry, tit-bitch,\" Melka murmurs, her voice laced with genuine regret. But there's no escaping it, not for me. As she secures the leather cuffs around my wrists and ankles, the reality of my situation comes crashing down. I'm spread wide open, my body bared for all to see, my pussy sopping and glistening.\n\nMelka chuckles, a soft sound that echoes eerily in the room, \"Look at you, drippin' like a ripe fruit.\" Her words make me blush.\n\nWith one final tug, the cuffs are secured, and my body is stretched taut. The room grows silent, save for my ragged breaths and the soft whisper of Melka's movements. Every inch of my being is consumed by the burning arousal, my mind foggy and clouded, the pulsating need in my pussy becoming an urgent demand. My clit throbs in time with my heartbeats, a constant, insistent reminder of my situation. The potent goblin seed wriggles inside me, its alien warmth intensifying my desire.\n\nThe door creaks open, and in walks Grouz, the old goblin shaman, a hunched figure shrouded in tattered robes. The room grows colder, an icy chill creeping into the very marrow of my bones. My heart pounds in my chest, my pussy throbbing in time.\n\nMelka and Grouz speak in hushed whispers, their words a mere murmur against the throbbing in my ears. Melka gestures towards me, her face set in an expression of grim determination, while Grouz's eyes rake over my body, causing a shiver of disgust to run through me. Yet, in my hazy state, the feeling quickly melts away.\n\nGrouz begins his ritual, his gnarled hands moving in slow, measured patterns over my body. His touch is surprisingly gentle, though his palms are cold and clammy, making my skin pucker under the chill. There's a strange hum in the air, like a low, resonating thrum that sends shivers down my spine, coursing through my pussy and tightening my nipples. The sensations dance over my skin, weaving an intricate tapestry of sensations.\n\nI feel a wave of relaxation washing over me, like a sigh echoing through my body, easing the aches and pains. The tension in my muscles slowly dissipates, my body growing heavy with exhaustion. But the heat in my belly remains, the cum stirring restlessly within me, a constant reminder of my subjugation. The desire doesn't leave, it just dulls, becomes more manageable. It's a small mercy, yet one that I'm grateful for.\n\nAs the ritual concludes, the room falls silent. My eyes, heavy-lidded and clouded, blink up at the dimly lit tent ceiling, the fabric a blur of shapes and shadows. My mind is wrapped in a fog, the world around me a dizzying whirl of colors and sounds, all seeming to melt into each other.\n\n\"I've got somethin' I need to do tonight, Tit-bitch,\" Melka says, her voice sounding like it's coming from the end of a long tunnel. “Jus’ - hang in there. One more night.”\n\nI try to respond, to ask her what's happening, but the words die in my throat, replaced by a heavy yawn that stretches my jaw.\n\nMelka's face, bathed in the dim torchlight, becomes an island of tranquility in a tumultuous sea. There's an emerald iridescence to her skin, starkly contrasting the gloom around her, a beacon cutting through the darkness. Her sparkling amethyst eyes, normally filled with goblin mischief, now glimmer with a strange depth.\n\nI see sorrow - a ghost of the past, a whisper of the forgotten. It’s a moment that's as swift as it is poignant, leaving an indelible impression upon me.\n\nThe shaman’s magic takes deeper hold. As Melka’s cryptic words echo around me, a lullaby of melancholy, sleep begins to wrap me like a soft blanket. My eyes flutter shut, my body surrendering to the darkness.\n\n[Choice: After a fitful sleep in the rack...",

It isn't until I focus my hazy vision, realizing the sensation isn't just my imagination, that I notice how damp I am. The rack's cold leather is a contrast to the hot flush that's taken over my body, my slender stomach slick with a thin layer of sweat. A whisper of a moan leaves me at the chill touch of the leather against my heated skin.\n\nMy raven-black hair is plastered to my damp forehead. It tickles my swollen eyes as I blink away the vestiges of sleep, and some sort of stickiness, trying to piece together yesterday’s event. I was... I was... My mind’s foggy, memories slipping away, like a dream on the verge of waking.\n\nMy vision drops to my chest, my massive boobs sprawled to either side. They’re so heavy, their weight pulling at me sideways, stacked on my ribcage. My pink nipples stand out starkly against my pale skin, achingly erect. There's a new sensation, a tingling sort of pressure that's somehow different from arousal. It's centered in my areolas, radiating out into the surrounding flesh, my breasts pulsing with a strange warmth.\n\nA soft groan rumbles from my throat as a heat prickles along my body, pooling between my wide-spread legs. My pussy is dripping, the juices trickling onto the bench. It's slick and warm under my ass, the wetness squelching with every small shift of my body. The sensation is... not unpleasant, almost comforting in the foggy stupor of my mind.\n\nI whimper as another coil of heat unfurls inside me, the throbbing ache between my legs growing more intense than before. I’ve been struggling with arousal for days, but it’s worse than ever now. If I could move my legs, I would clench them together. This sensation is beyond anything I've ever known, as if my body, my entire being, is begging for something... But what?\n\nThe thought of breeding flits through my mind, a quicksilver flash of an idea that has me squirming. But it slips away before I can even consider it, leaving me aching and empty. My nipples twitch, another drop of slickness oozes from my pussy.\n\nNot everything is pleasant. My wrists and ankles feel raw, chafed against the leather straps. But the physical discomfort is distant, mostly subdued by the all-encompassing warmth flooding my senses.\n\nSlowly, the memories start to resurface. Grokk. The goblin chief. Oh gods, his cock. Sixteen inches of pure goblin malice ramming down my throat. That's why my throat hurts. That's why I ache. He used me, face-fucked me until he drained his balls into my tummy.\n\nAs for where all that cum went, my stomach has returned to its flat state, yet a horrible thought crosses my foggy mind. Has it been absorbed into me? The thought SHOULD revolt me, yet I find no negativity, only the warmth of my stupor and the echoing hum of something almost like satisfaction.\n\nStruggling to bring my scattered thoughts into focus, I remember Melka, the goblin girl. I remember her kindness, but it's like trying to hold onto smoke. It's the same when I try to remember my past as Aldric, or my wife Elara. It's there, but it slips through my mental grasp, like everything else, it fades into the fog. All I'm left with is the intoxicating warmth, the persistent arousal, the throbbing, needy ache of my pussy. The sight of my own body, open and ready in the breeding rack.\n\nMy mind should rebel against this thought, yet it keeps slipping towards ideas of breeding, of carrying goblin whelps. And the more it slips, the more the haze in my mind thickens, muffling all thoughts except the physical sensations flooding me. The heat, the wetness, the throbbing arousal, and the peculiar fullness in my breasts.\n\nMy mind feels like a blanket's been thrown over it, my thoughts muffled, edges blurred.\n\n[Choice: Two figures approach.",

His companion is larger, his muscular form casting a long shadow on the tent floor, a formidable beast with gnarled features and menacing eyes. Grokk. My pussy clenches at the sight of him, instinctively. A shiver of apprehension runs through me, conflicting with the flush of warmth that blooms inside.\n\n\"Boss, we gotta wait one more day. One more load of gobbo goo in her, and then she'll be ripe,\" Grouz's voice grates out, that crude language jarring my senses.\n\nGrokk snarls in return, his voice the crash of boulders. \"You said I could breed the bitch today. I ain't waiting.\"\n\nGrouz looks down, visibly swallowing his fear. \"Boss, her body's still getting used to gobbo cocks. One more day and you'll have the best chance for healthy whelps.

I can feel the slight slipperiness beneath my ass, the slickness of my arousal coating the leather of the rack. I hate it, but my body loves it.\n\nAnd all the while, my mind screams against the fog, a desperate cry for help in the obscurity, my need for escape a sharp spike in the haze. But my body responds with a simmering heat, a gentle pulse in my lower belly, a traitorous testament to the effects of the pheromones.\n\nI should not want this. I am a human, not a goblin's breeding stock. I must resist. I must... My mind slips back into the fog, their voices fading as my body clenches again, the heat inside me burning brighter.\n\nThe argument between Grouz and Grokk escalates, the tone of their voices intensifying. Grouz, in his desperation, says, \"This girl, Grokk, she's the best we've ever gotten from the Gobboree. Just look at her. Broad hips, a birth canal wider than a river's mouth. She's the ONE!”\n\nGrokk snarls in response, a low and guttural sound, like a wolf snapping at its prey. \"I've heard enough, old man,\" he growls, and with a quick motion, yanks off his loincloth.\n\nI gasp as his cock springs free, and he stands between my legs, his cock rearing overhead. A steaming glob of precum dribbles out and lands in the valley between my tits, sending a shudder of revulsion through me, and the noxious sent through my nostrils. At the same time, I feel a surge of heat from my core, my pussy clenching and pulsing uncontrollably, as though preparing itself for what is about to happen.\n\nGrouz looks stricken, his withered face full of dismay. “Boss, you must listen!\" he insists, his voice raising an octave. \"Your family line is at stake! I've been guidin’ your kin for generations, saw your grandad Griznak to his death, watched over your father Grukzak, and now you. Do not throw this away in your impatience.”\n\nDespite his pleas, Grokk lifts his massive schlong, smacking it against my taut belly, creating a resounding slap. My body reacts instantly, my hips arching towards him and a whimper escaping from my lips. The contrast between us is stark - him with his brutal, unforgiving masculinity, me with my softness, my curves.\n\nMy mind is spinning, my thoughts disjointed and fragmented due to the pheromones clouding my senses. I feel his massive member pressing against my belly, so warm and hard and alive. His balls, dense and filled with his potent seed, press up against my lower lips. I can't control my body's response - the moans, the way my pussy clenches and spasms, releasing more slick wetness. I bite down on my lower lip as my back arches involuntarily, my body begging for more.\n\nGrouz, looking both desperate and terrified, makes one last plea. \"Grokk, if you need to empty your balls, do it in her mouth, or use one of the other bitches,\" he begs. \"This one, she's special. She needs ONE MORE DAY.”\n\nBut Grokk ignores his plea, instead, he grinds his thick cock against my slit. My whole body convulses in pleasure, the sensations overwhelming every part of me.\n\n[Choice: Moan like a bitch.",

Grokk roars in frustration, yanks his loincloth back up, and charges out of the room, followed by a clearly relieved Grouz.\n\nI am left alone, strung up in the rack, my body still tingling and twitching with the phantom sensation of his cock against my aching pussy. The fog in my brain seems to lift just slightly at their departure, and I am left with the horrifying realization of how close I came to being bred by that monstrous creature.\n\nThe cries of goblins and the acrid scent of smoke stir me from my fog. What’s happening? My thoughts scatter like frightened rabbits, one crashing into another. I try to focus, but I can't. I can still feel the ghost of Grokk’s hot, massive cock on my stomach, the incessant pulsing between my thighs.

Familiar.\n\n\"Ye can use your magic, slut.”\n\n[Choice: It's Snib!!!]Grokk stands between my wide-spread legs, his grotesque, muscled form towering over me.

But you humans, your wombs are so fucking welcoming, ain’t they? Born to be breeding vessels for goblin kind.\"\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nHis monstrous cock aligns with my dripping cunt again, and this time he doesn't just brush against it - he slaps it hard. The obscene sound of his meaty flesh against my swollen pussy lips resonates in the dimly lit tent, a vulgar symphony of my debasement. I whimper, unable to stop the sound or the way my body arches up, begging for more despite my terror.\n\n\"You feel that, bitch?\" Grokk sneers, pressing his cock harder against me, making me squirm. \"Your fear, it fucking stinks, and it smells delicious.\"\n\nGrouz, standing a safe distance away, shifts uncomfortably, wringing his hands. \"Lord Grokk, please, she needs more time. She's not fully in heat—\"\n\n\"Shut your gob, Grouz!\" Grokk snaps without looking away from me. He grabs his dick, guiding the head, smearing my lips with his filthy pre-cum. \"This bitch is as in heat as they come. Look at her dripping hole, soaking my breeding pole.\"\n\nI can’t hold back a cry as he continues to toy with me, his words slicing through any remnants of dignity I had clung to. His cock, a vile tower of flesh, nudges insistently at my entrance, the head parting my pussy lips, taunting me with the prospect of impossibly stretching me open.\n\n\"Usually,” Grokk growls, pressing just the tip against me, making me gasp at the pressure, \"a bitch fully in heat takes my mega fucking loads deep.

My breasts jiggle with the intensity of the sensation. I try to hold onto it, to understand it, but it slips through my foggy grasp.\n\n\"Go on,\" another voice pleads. Melka, a goblin girl. I remember her, with her high voice and strangely soft eyes. \"Use it to get free!\"\n\nI open my mouth to reply but no words come out, just a needy whimper. Panic swells in my chest. I can't remember. My tears mingle with the sweat trickling down my face. \"I c- can't...\" I manage to sob out. “The incantations… I don’t… remember…”\n\n\"She can't, see!\" Melka hisses at Snib. Her voice has a peculiar sharpness to it, like she's suppressing her own fury. \"She's had two loads of Grokks' gobbo goo! She's almost lost her mind! She only listens to him!”\n\n\"No!\" Snib snarls back, his words a low, menacing growl. \"I'm NOT releasin' my cow tits.\" There's an edge to his voice, one I'm not used to. “Ye didn’t see what he’s like. He’s a killer.”\n\nA pause. I feel Melka’s gaze on me, her silence heavy. \"Well, she’s gonna be full of Grokk’s pups soon. She isn't your cow tits anymore. She’s Grokk’s Tit-bitch.\"\n\nSnib's growl escalates into a roar. He sounds like a cornered beast, angry and desperate. \"Grokk cheated me! I am GETTIN her back.”\n\nBut the argument floats past me. My mind is too consumed by my situation. Strapped in the breeding rack, spread eagled, I wrestle with my confusion and arousal. I need to remember the magic, the power I once had. But it's like trying to hold onto water. Slipping through my fingers as my body throbs with unfulfilled desire.\n\nAnother hiss cuts through my fog. \"I'll fuckin’ kill ya, Snib, if you don't release her!\" Melka’s voice. A threat laced with an undercurrent of desperation.\n\nAn odd squeal follows. Snib’s retort is a garbled mess, a whine. \"Stop pinchin' me!\"\n\nThen, a soft scraping sound. My blurry gaze flicks towards it. There, under the edge of the tent, a sword gleams, passed under the tent wall.\n\n[Choice: Whisperwind!]",

My throat raw, the sound that shreds out is obscenely loud, filled with pain and a creeping, all-consuming pleasure.\n\nGrokk grunts crudely, gazing down at me with undisguised contempt, his huge, naked green form reeking of foul sweat, utterly dominating me with his size and the filthy stench.\n\nMy mind blanks out from the sheer intensity of being so fully stretched out. It's not just being stretched; it's being completely, savagely reshaped by the enormity of his girth.\n\nGrokk rams forward, each push a deeper desecration of my insides.\n\n“My fucking jerk-off sleeve cunt whore,” he growls as he buries himself to the hilt, 16 inches of goblin chieftain's cock penetrating deep into my core.\n\nHis huge balls slap against me again, a vulgar sound following my scream. A heavy, obscene weight rests against my ass, and every tremor through his groin sends ripples of filthy sensation inside me. I whimper helplessly, the whimper jagged, raw—*he's so fucking deep*.\n\n\"Fucking humans,\" Grokk spits down at me, \"so full of yourselves, till a real gobbo dick fills you up. Pumping your womb full enough, you'll forget your pathetic human bloodline.\"\n\nHis words slap me as hard as his balls against my ass. I feel my face flush hot, from a mounting combination of factors.\n\nNot the least of which is the feeling of the huge helmet of his cock grinding deep, impacting my cervix, stretching, dilating it. It's a sensation so grotesque, so painfully intimate it snaps something inside me.\n\nHis girth presses insistently, hammering into that tender, forbidden door, forcing it—oh gods, *forcing it*—pressing inside, an invasion so complete it bleaches my brain of everything but the blinding heat.\n\nI squeal, high-pitched, delirious, each plea dripping with self-degradation. \"PISS INTO MY WOMB! Make my fucking womb your *sperm toilet!* Fucking ruin my human body! Breed me till no human bloodline can claim me... make it gobbo... make it *yours!*\"\n\nGrokk thrusts, each slam punctuated by his crude cheering. \"That's it, cunt, squeal for gobbo cock. Your tits are nothing but milk bags for gobbo pups.\"\n\nEach filthy pheremone-addled proclamation sears my crumbled psyche, the chieftain's words marring my jumbled thoughts as his cock mauls my cervix, the heat unbearable, the stretch nauseatingly exquisite.\n\nMy pussy clamps down, my inner walls clenching wildly around his shaft. A primitive, obscene desperation claws at me. My womb is MILKING him. Squeezing aroun his cock.\n\nPressure builds, unbearable, scorching, a climax that tears through me without mercy.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nI cum.\n\nIt's mindless, shameless... my womb clenching around the invasive bulk of his dominating cockhead. Squirt after squirt of my arousal jets out, splattering Grokk's groin as he laughs.\n\nThe goblin roars above me, the sound triumphant. The pulsating beam of his cock swells, the vein throbbing violently along its underside. \"Here comes the gobbo gravy, bitch. Gonna drown your uppity human bloodline in pure gobbo seed. But I want you to beg for it.\"\n\n[Choice: Beg for it!]\n\nThe blade shimmers, a dance of ethereal blues and purples. Something nags at me, a distant memory. My eyes narrow, trying to pierce the thick haze shrouding my brain. It’s Whisperwind, my old sword. My - Aldric's - sword. The realization crashes into me like a tidal wave.\n\n\"You idiot, Snib!\" Melka's voice ripples with a potent mixture of frustration and anger. \"Her wrists and feet are BOUND! What's she gonna do with the sword? Release her from her fuckin' collar first!”\n\n\"But—\"\n\n\"Just do it, Snib! For your revenge against Grokk!\" She pleads, and I hear a thread of urgency woven in her voice.\n\nAbruptly, the tent flap is thrown open and a brutish figure stomps in. Grokk. His eyes land on the sword on the floor and his thick brows furrow in confusion. \"WHAT IS THIS?\" He roars, nostrils flaring. His gaze swivels to me, pinning me with a searing glare. \"WHO WAS IN HERE?\"\n\nIn the quiet that follows, Snib's voice cuts through, a note of resignation in his tone. \"Be… free, cow tits.”\n\nSuddenly, a rush of magic pulses from the collar around my neck, a wave of power that knocks Grokk off his feet. The cursed metal band snaps open, falling to the ground with an echo that resounds throughout the tent. I gasp, feeling the constraint lifted for the first time.\n\n[Choice: You feel different!]",

Yes! *Dump your fucking load into me!*” I scream, mindlessly, senselessly. “*Wreck my egg tunnel with your gobbo filth!* Breed me into extinction, *erase my pathetic human lineage!*”\n\nEach obscenity that spills from my lips triggers another sharp, soul-tearing brain-orgasm, my battered pussy squirting uncontrollably as if celebrating my ruination. The heat inside me builds to an inferno, each phrase a log thrown onto the fire.\n\nGrokk’s filthy laughter fills the tent, a sound so cruel it should've shamed me into silence. Instead, it fuels me. His large hand strikes my face, a sharp smack that turns my head, my cheeks stinging, my mind reeling.\n\n“Gonna fill you up so good,” he grunts, his massive body tensing, his thrusts growing erratic but even more forceful. His cock swells inside me, the ominous pulsing signaling what’s to come.\n\nMy heart pounds, a drumbeat of sick anticipation. “Please, Master Grokk, make me your cum dumpster, drown my eggs in your superior goblin seed!”\n\nWith a deep, guttural roar, Grokk’s control snaps. His hips hammer against mine, brutally hard. “Take it, you human pig,” he bellows as his cock bulges alarmingly, the first jet of scalding goblin cum shooting straight into my womb.\n\nHis ejaculation is monstrous, each spurt a hot, violent slap of semen against my tender inner walls. I feel my stomach distending, his seed filling me, claiming me.\n\n\"Breed you till you can’t remember being anything *but* a goblin’s cum-dump. Make you forget you were ever a hero!\" he roars with each spasm, his body shuddering above me, his claws digging into the flesh of my thighs. “You’ll never be free! You’ll never again not be pregnant!”\n\nHis words, vile and sealing, wash over me like acid, corroding the last remnants of my resistance. I sob, clenching around him, milking him, as if I love being the vessel of his vile offspring.\n\nMaybe I do.\n\nWhen his orgasm finally ebbs, my pussy is oozing, wrecked, overflowing with gobbo sperm. I lay there, gasping, feeling something shift inside me—some dark realization that everything he said was now my truth.\n\nFemale slaves, giggling, sashay over to me. They stare down at my ruined sex.\n\nThey're carrying a gauze pad soaked in some tacky substance. They carefully but firmly press it against my swollen, cum-leaking pussy, their nimble fingers ensuring every crevice is sealed, trapping Grokk’s seed within me.\n\nAs the cool substance solidifies, forming a barrier, a shield locking his filth inside me, reality crystallizes. I've been impregnated, truly and utterly conquered. My soul feels heavy, burdened with the weight of Grokk's seed, a burden I would carry beneath my heart, a relentless reminder of my complete and utter subjugation.\n\nA tear trickles down my cheek, lost in the sea of other sensations, as I lie back against the rack, resigned, broken. The heat in my belly is not just from his cum but from a shattered spirit accepting its fate: I am Grokk's property, now and forever.\n\n(:\"10 banquet\",10,\"You live out the rest of your short days as Grokk's breeding bitch...\")]I feel my body ripple. Start to vibrate. My eyes, wide with surprise, stare down at my chest. It's shaking, and I see my full, round tits start to recede. I can feel the weight lifting, the pull lessening. The change isn't painful, but it's intense. The sensation feels like a hand gently pressing, shaping, molding. It's as though an artist is working his fingers through clay, sculpting my body back into its original form. The tits that had jiggled with every step now flatten, morphing into a firm, muscular chest. I can feel the ridges of muscle, the sturdy plane of pectorals replacing the soft swell of my breasts.\n\nMy stomach is next. I watch, in almost detached fascination, as my slim, soft belly ripples and clenches. Like waves on the ocean, they build, peak and fall, each wave carving out another section of Aldric's toned abs. The transformation sweeps down to my hips. They had been wide, inviting. Now, they shrink, muscles tensing and tightening, my body losing its feminine curves, replaced with a more angular, masculine silhouette.\n\nI flex my hands, feeling the strange sensation of my dainty fingers growing larger, stronger. The petite hands, once Elise's, are now replaced with Aldric's warrior hands, broad and calloused. My shoulders broaden, my muscles flex, causing the leather of the breeding bench beneath me to creak and strain. My hair, once long and luscious, now shortens, becoming a rough, warrior's cut.\n\nDown below, a strange sensation. My gaze drops and I see the transformation taking place. My female slit disappears, replaced by the familiar shape of a cock. My cock. Aldric's cock. A dusting of hair starts to sprout on my chest, my body no longer the smooth, hairless form of Elise. I am becoming Aldric, the transformation nearing its end.\n\nThe fog that has been clouding my thoughts starts to lift, like a mist burning away under the morning sun. Memories, thoughts, clear and unclouded flood back into my brain. One memory in particular pierces through. A word. An incantation.\n\n[Choice: 'Ignisurge.']",

It's time for the next chapter in my story to begin. And the final chapter of Grokk’s brutish existence.\n\nThe goblin chief growls, considering me, a predator surveying his opponent. His eyes glitter, his yellow teeth bared in a disgusting grin. “So, it was you under there. A man. Hah!” His voice rumbles, as heavy as a rockslide, stirring the air in the tent. “This is why I hate magic.”\n\nI meet his gaze. I am no prey. I am no slave. I am a warrior. I am Aldric, the man, the hero of Eboncrest.\n\n“I am Aldric, you filth. Too long. Too fucking long you've terrorized our people. Enslaved our women. Tainted their bodies.”\n\nGrokk's laughter is harsh, mocking. \"Oh, human,” he scoffs, his eyes narrowing, fixing me with a cruel gaze. “They love it. You’ve seen it yourself.” He points at the pussy-juice pooling on the bench. “You’ve loved it yourself.”\n\nMy fists clench and unclench, muscles coiling tight with fury. My gaze flits to the side, landing on Whisperwind. The sword is a mere few feet away, the blade still shimmering with an ethereal light. A weapon I could use. But Grokk deserves a more personal touch. I want to kill him with my bare hands.\n\nThe roar of rage and defiance that rips from my throat, Aldric's throat, is raw, primal.\n\nMy newly transformed legs push off the ground, propelling me towards Grokk. But something's off. The momentum feels all wrong, the stride too long. Damn it, I've misjudged. I've spent too long in a woman's body. The smaller steps, the wider hips, all made for a different center of gravity. Now, I'm taller, my hips narrower, my stride is longer. It's like learning to walk all over again.\n\nGrokk capitalizes on my fumble. A deep, cruel laugh booms from him as he steps aside, watching as I stumble past him. \"What’s wrong, human?” He sneers. “Got your tits in a twist?\"\n\nHe slams into me, taking me down to the rough hide rug that adorns his tent floor. I feel his monstrous weight on top of me, his hands pressing down, squeezing my throat. His breath, rank and fetid, washes over my face, making my stomach churn.\n\n\"Humans,\" he spits, his voice a rumbling growl that reverberates through his chest and into me. \"Weak. Inferior. Your women are good for one thing only, and even then, they’re just a means to an end.\"\n\nHe tightens his grip, his claws digging into the flesh of my throat, and I gasp, straining for air. The world is starting to spin, the edges of my vision growing dark. But I refuse to go down without a fight.\n\nIn desperation, I reach up, attempting to claw at his eyes, but he merely grunts and swings his head away, avoiding my swipe. My move has cost me, my arms are now pinned above my head, and Grokk grins down at me, a predatory glint in his eyes. \"Pathetic.\"\n\nDespite the crushing pressure on my throat, my mind is racing. There's a move I know, one I could use if I can pull it off. An escape, an elbow escape from bottom position, perfect for when you're on your back and the enemy is in full mount.\n\n[Choice: Use an elbow escape.",

With a swift, jerking movement, I pull my elbow to my side, sliding my forearm under Grokk's armpit.\n\nNow comes the tricky part. Using all my strength, I swing my left leg, planting my foot on the ground and rolling to my right, onto my side. The movement takes Grokk by surprise, and he wobbles, his balance unsteady. With a final push, I roll, forcing Grokk to fall off me, his hand releasing my throat.\n\nAir. Sweet, sweet air. I gasp, filling my lungs with much-needed oxygen. Grokk is sprawled on the ground next to me, momentarily stunned. But I can't afford to waste any more time. I scramble to my feet, ignoring the weakness in my knees, the trembling in my legs.\n\nGrokk is starting to recover, beginning to push himself up. I need to act, now. He’s stronger, but I know I’m better.\n\nThe goblin chief snarls at me, his face a wicked portrait of goblin green, yellow fangs glistening. He’s big. He points to his huge cock, his words curling in the air like foul smoke. \"Humanity... is the past. We're gonna fuck your kind off the face of Zaelasia.”\n\nHis words fill me with an inferno of rage. Each syllable feeds the flames. I remember Elise, remember the fucking breeding rack, the metallic taste of his goblin seed. The shameful memories flow like molten metal, scalding, fusing with the anger, igniting an explosive reaction.\n\n\"Over my dead body, you sick fuck!\" My own voice shocks me. It's deep, commanding. It echoes off the cavern walls, drowning out the lewd, distant cacophony of the Griznak Gobboree. Grokk sneers, an ugly curl of his wide, bulbous nose.

He thrashes for a moment, and then goes still.\n\nGoblin blood flows like a river, staining the animal furs. I stand there, his blood dripping from my hands, my heart pounding like a war drum. My chest heaves, a sweet symphony of victory that resonates within the tent.\n\n\"I AM ALDRIC,” I roar. \"And you,\" I glance down at Grokk's lifeless body, a satisfied smirk playing on my lips, \"are nothing more than a bad memory.\"\n\nMy breaths echo in the hush that follows the chieftain’s death.

Melka's doing, I reckon - a distraction, the clever goblin girl seems to have set the stage for my entrance.\n\nA gust of wind whips through the air, carrying with it the repugnant stench of goblin sweat and the distinct odor of fear.

It sings, the wind swirling around it as though in a gleeful dance.

The memory of their heinous acts fuels my fury, turning every move into a statement of defiance.\n\nWith each fallen goblin, I grow stronger, their fear empowering me. I am Aldric, the human who dared to rebel. I am their nightmare, the demon in their folklore. And I am just getting started.\n\nThe shrieks and chants of the remaining goblins echo around me, Skulgaroth, Skulgaroth, a mantra of challenge and terror. My chest rises and falls, the rhythm punctuated by the sharp thud of my pulse. I can taste copper on my tongue, the metallic kiss of battle, my skin sticky with the sweat and blood of a dozen goblin warriors.\n\nThen, the goblin sea parts, giving way to a monstrous figure. A rumble of anticipation runs through the crowd as Krognar emerges from their midst. My heart lurches, a wild drumbeat against the raw memories that flood back, bringing a taste of bitter familiarity. This isn't the first time I've stared down this beast.\n\nKrognar is a walking mountain, a grotesque fusion of flesh and muscle that dwarfs the goblins around him. He’s as hideous as I remember. Over eight feet of gnarled, scarred muscle that seem chiseled from the toughest granite. His arms are grotesque tree trunks, ending in massive hands that can crush skulls like ripe fruit. My eyes roam over the patchwork of battle scars littering his hide, each mark a grim testament to his brutal past.\n\nHis morning star slams into the ground with a sickening thud, its spiked head leaving an imprint in the dirt. A skull-crushing testament to his brutality. The sight tightens something in my gut, the warrior within me keenly aware of the threat before me.\n\nA sudden surge of anger pulses through my veins, drowning out the remnants of the goblin pheromones plaguing my body, snapping my focus back to the present. I'm not Elise anymore. I am Aldric, the seasoned warrior, the hero of Eboncrest. This body, this muscled form, it’s mine again. The firm grip on Whisperwind’s hilt, the faint hum of its magic, it’s all so familiar, so right.\n\n[Choice: Settle things with Krognar.",

This time, it’s a duel between equals, between warriors.\n\nA slight shift in the wind sends a gust of smoke from the blazing tents into the air, the fiery glow casting a ghastly pallor on the slaughter-strewn ground. The stench of burnt flesh and goblin blood fills my nostrils, a cruel orchestra of war playing out on this unholy stage.\n\nI step forward, the dust and grit of the earth crunching beneath my boots. I raise Whisperwind in challenge, the blade gleaming iridescently, a conduit for my resolve. “Krognar,” I call out, my voice a deep rumble that echoes against the silence that’s fallen over the crowd.

Krognar is upon me again, a relentless force that seems to shrug off every wound, every slash of my blade.\n\nThe terrain works against me, the sandy floor a treacherous bed of shifting uncertainty beneath my boots. The burning tents cast monstrous shadows that dance and flicker with a life of their own, the chaotic light making it harder to anticipate Krognar's next move.\n\nBut this is my fight, my survival. I dodge another swipe of his morning star, my lean body twisting in a way it wouldn’t have as Elise. I revel in the powerful rush of adrenaline, the hard-won freedom of movement.\n\nMy next move is a blur of speed, my blade slicing through the air towards Krognar's exposed side. There's a sickening squelch of steel meeting flesh, a gratifying howl that breaks from the troll's lips. But victory is fleeting; his retaliatory backhand sends me skidding through the sand, my vision blurred by a haze of pain and dizziness.\n\nThrough the crowd's frenzied roars, I hear my name—my true name—echoed by the wind. It's a raw, feral reminder of who I am. I'm Aldric, a seasoned swordsman, a whirlwind of determination and grit. With a surge of effort, I push myself to my feet, my grip on Whisperwind unyielding.\n\nDespite the pounding in my head, the aching in my bones, I square my stance, my gaze locked onto Krognar's heaving form.

The camp is a sprawling nightmare, spreading across the dunes like a festering wound. Tents stretch as far as I can see, dwarfed by the monstrous caravan carts. Campfires scatter across the landscape, their flickering lights casting long, lewd shadows that dance upon the sand.\n\nAs we thunder through the heart of the Gobboree, debauchery spills out from the tents in waves.

The goblins are rousing, their raucous laughter replaced by shouts of alarm. But we're fast, too fast. The horse is a desert-born beast, its hooves kicking up sand and dust as we tear through the Gobboree. The caravan begins to fade, the fires becoming distant specks against the looming darkness of the desert night.\n\n\"Where to?\" Melka asks, her voice strained from the effort. “Which way to Eboncrest?\"\n\nThe question is music to my ears.

They don’t feel arousing, like they did when I was female. They just feel toxic. Everything feels distant, an echo of reality, the edges of my vision swimming.\n\n\"Nah, ya ain't,\" she retorts, her grip tightening around my waist. Her body is warm against my back, her heartbeat thumping a comforting rhythm against my spine. \"Ya're losing too much blood, Tit-bitch.\"\n\nI am aware of the wound on my side, an ugly gash that Krognar's morningstar had gifted me.

Not after being Elise.\"\n\nHer hand stills on my arm. \"You got nothing to apologize for, Aldric,\" she insists firmly, her gaze serious. \"What happened... it wasn't your fault. You survived. You fought. That's what matters.\"\n\nMelka's eyes glint with mischief as she looks me up and down, taking in the sight of my muscular frame.\n\n\"Well, look at ya,\" she grins, hand on her hip. \"Ya might've lost those tits, but ya still got women's hair.”\n\nI run a hand through the thick, unruly strands.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I mumble. \"Guess I do.\"\n\n“Human men usually keep it short, right?” she says. \"Want me to cut it for ya?\"\n\nI look at her, surprised by the offer. \"That... that'd be great, Melka. Thanks.\"\n\nShe grabs her knife, its blade gleaming in the candlelight.\n\n\"Alright, sit,\" she orders, pointing to the edge of the bed. I comply, my heart beating a little faster at the thought of shedding this last remnant of Elise.\n\nMelka climbs onto the bed behind me, her knee nudging against my back as she settles in. The knife glints in her small, capable hand, and she begins to gather my hair with the other, her fingers rough against my scalp. Her breath is warm against the back of my neck, sending a shiver down my spine.\n\n\"Ya know, for a hero, ya really got long, luxurious locks,\" she says.\n\n\"Yeah, well,\" I grunt, feeling a surge of relief as the first locks fall away. \"It wasn't by choice.\"\n\nA soft snort escapes her as she continues to cut, her knife slicing through the heavy strands. With each cut, I feel a piece of Elise falling away, a piece of my captivity. The sensation of her little green fingers brushing against my scalp is oddly soothing.\n\n\"Don't squirm so much. Ya got a sensitive scalp or somethin'?\"\n\nThe last length of hair falls, and she stands back, her fingers ruffling through the shortened strands to even them out.\n\n\"There,\" she whispers. \"Yer lookin' more like yerself now, I imagine. Aldric, the hero. Skulgaroth.\"\n\nI catch my reflection in a small, cracked mirror propped against the wall. The short, ragged hair gives me a sense of reclaimed identity, a piece of Aldric that had been buried under months of forced femininity.\n\nI turn back to Melka, her green fingers brushing a stray strand off my forehead. \"Thanks,\" I murmur.\n\nThe goblin girl turns her attention to the meal on the table. I follow her gaze, my stomach rumbling at the sight of the steaming stew, chunks of tender meat and root vegetables peeking through the thick, herby gravy. Alongside it is a jug of what smells like sweet berry wine and a fresh, crusty loaf of bread.\n\n\"Smells better'n goblin grub,\" Melka murmurs, her voice choked with emotion. \"Damn, real food. Proper food.\" Without another word, she begins to wolf it down, her delight almost childlike as she savors each bite. The wine flows freely, her cup refilled multiple times, her cheeks slowly turning a deeper shade of green.\n\nSeeing her happiness, something warm uncurls in my chest, a quiet joy at seeing her so content. The meal is delicious, the flavors rich and comforting, a taste of home. For a moment, I forget the aches and pains, the pheromone-induced haze in my mind. In that moment, it's just us, two unlikely companions sharing a meal and finding comfort in each other's company.\n\nI watch as Melka finishes off her meal with a satisfied sigh, her eyes sparkling with an excitement I hadn't seen before.\n\n[Choice: You suddenly feel dizzy...",

The taste of humiliation clings to my tongue, bitter and shameful, as my grip tightens on my cock. Elara, I think. My beautiful wife, her auburn hair cascading over her perfect breasts, her sapphire eyes sparkling with desire...\n\nBut the image is tainted, Grokk's monstrous face intruding on my fantasy, his 16-inch orange-tipped cock thrusting into Elise's face, into my face. A nauseating feeling spreads through me as my mind betrays me, the sensation of large breasts hanging heavy from my chest, the slickness between my legs...\n\nNo, no, no! I squeeze my eyes shut, shaking my head as if it could clear the images away. My hand is on my cock, it's my hand, my cock, but it feels foreign, alien, like a tool I don't quite know how to use.\n\nI grapple with the unwanted memories, my cock a lifeless weight in my hands. The mirth in Melka's voice filters through the haze of my torment, cutting through the thick fog of desperation.\n\n\"Havin' trouble, Aldric?\" she chuckles, though there's a touch of concern beneath the mirth. “Ye really will die if ye don’t get off. I watched a man once, they fucked ‘is wife right in front of ‘im. He got some on ‘im when he tried to help her… the man was dead the next morning.

I stumble out from behind the screen, my cock limp in my hand, my body drenched in a cold sweat. The smirk on her face sends a jolt of anger through me, but it's a feeble flame against the engulfing dread.

Her green fingers reach for the coiled leather top she’s wearing. It's a crude goblin garb, hardy and tough, constructed to withstand the harsh conditions of her desert lifestyle. Yet, as her fingers uncoil the garment, it reveals an elegance that belies its crude nature. It’s like a flower, unfurling its petals, gradually, one by one, to reveal the beauty beneath.\n\nWith each layer she peels away, her large breasts are slowly unveiled, the strain against her chest slowly receding, making room for them to breath, to expand. The sight leaves me breathless. Her big green breasts strain against the thin strip of cloth barely covering them. I swallow hard, my eyes unblinking as they drink in the view.\n\n\"Big for a gobbo-girl, eh?\" She chuckles, an impish grin playing on her lips. Her short black curls bounce as she laughs, falling into her sparkling purple eyes. They glint with a fiery confidence, staring at me as if challenging me to look away.\n\n[Choice: You can't.",

The sight is like a slap to my senses, the delicious curves of her ass demanding my full attention. My cock stirs, a low throb of heat blooming at the sight of her, like a beast sensing its mate. Guilt sears my insides, yet it does nothing to cool the arousal that hums in my veins.\n\nAs her britches slide down, her ass pops out in a delicious, provocative display. The sight of her lush, round buttocks, all goosebumps on cool green skin, is like a visual feast to my eyes. There’s a wild, earthy beauty to her - the jiggly bounce to her flesh, the dimpled imperfections that hint at a life lived in the wild. The sight has my heart drumming in my ears, a feral rhythm matching the heat flooding my veins.\n\n\"Ya think it’s wrong, eh?\" she asks, her grin never leaving her face. “Don’t.

Even speaking feels like a monumental task, each word accompanied by a dizzying swirl of the room.\n\nMelka's shoulders slump, the tension leaving her body in an almost visible wave.

Slowly, almost reverently, my fingers ghost over her chest, feeling the band of cloth straining against her full, green breasts.\n\nA low moan slips from her lips, her eyes fluttering closed. The sound wraps around my brain like a fog, pulling me in deeper. \"Bet that'll do the trick, won't it?\" she whispers, a hint of her old flirtatious self seeping back in.\n\nHer green skin glows in the dim light, highlighting the delicious swell of her breasts. There's a roughness to it, a texture that speaks of a life lived outdoors. Yet, it's the slight goosebumps peppering her skin that really gets me, a sure sign of her arousal.\n\nMy cock finally stirs in response, a slow throb of heat kindling in my lower belly. A maddening mix of desire and guilt consumes me. Elara’s face flashes in my mind, and for a moment, I wince.\n\nShe's too small, too vulnerable under my touch. It feels wrong, yet I can't stop. The sounds she makes, the soft, sensual moans filling the air, they pull me in. She's beautiful in a way I hadn't noticed before. Her smile is sweet, her eyes bright with a unique spark.\n\nHer eyes are hypnotic, sparkling pools of liquid purple, glistening under the flickering lantern light. They're vast, larger than any human's, encasing an exotic beauty I can't comprehend. I can see intricate webs of color, violet hues fading into the darkness of her pupils. The whites of her eyes, unlike human eyes, carry a soft tint of lavender, adding to her inhuman allure.\n\nWithout warning, her lips crash into mine, catching me off guard. It's a hard, eager kiss, filled with a wildness I've never experienced. I can feel her sharp goblin teeth, pointy tips grazing my lips, a touch of danger to this intimate moment. Her breath is goblinesque, earthy, the taste is unfamiliar, yet intoxicating.\n\nShe bites my lower lip, a sharp sting radiates through my mouth, a prick of blood seeping onto my tongue. Her tongue darts out, tasting the blood, a feral grunt emanating from her throat. It's raw, it's intense, the sensations igniting a spark of arousal that coils tightly within me.\n\nMorning arrives with no relief.\n\nI’m confined to bed, the light streaming through the window too harsh, the sounds of the inn downstairs too loud. Thistlecross's doctors, a kindly young woman named Dr. Hester and her stern-faced apprentice, stand over me, their expressions grim.\n\nThey prod and they poke, mutter and murmur, but their potions and herbs do nothing to stop the relentless assault of the goblin pheromones. \"Never seen anything like it,\" Dr. Hester confesses, her voice low. \"It's as if something's eating away at his insides... right at his brain.\"\n\nEach hour my mind fades a little more. I can feel my thoughts slipping away, the edges of my memory fraying. The brief moments of clarity are just glimpses of sunlight through the dark storm clouds of confusion and delirium.\n\nBy midday, my speech is slurred, my vision blurred. I can’t remember why I’m here, or what I’m fighting. Elara's face—once the beacon keeping the darkness at bay—grows fainter with each passing moment.\n\nDr. Hester attempts one final remedy, a potent concoction meant to cleanse toxins, but it only causes violent convulsions. My body rejects it violently, a foaming mess of bile and blood staining the bed linens.\n\nAs the end nears, the inside of my head feels as if it's being scraped hollow. The pheromones, like voracious maggots, burrow through my neural pathways, devouring connections, memories, feelings. They leave behind a wasteland of confusion, a hollow shell where a hero once stood.\n\nMelka stays by my bed, her earlier cheeky smile replaced by a silent, somber vigil. Her hand rests on mine, her eyes never leaving my face as it contorts in pain.\n\nThe final throes are excruciating.\n\nEach breath is a labored rasp, a desperate gasp for air that feels as thick as mud. My heart pounds erratically, a frantic, futile attempt to keep going. But even that is failing.\n\nIn a rare moment of lucidity, amidst the deluge of pain and paranoia, I see Elara’s face. Not as a memory, but as a hallucination, perhaps a final mercy from my collapsing mind.\n\nHer soft hand seems to brush against my cheek, her voice a soothing whisper, \"Rest now, my love. Rest.\"\n\nThe end comes not with a roar, but a whisper. The last thing I feel isn't pain, but a fleeting sense of relief.\n\nLove.\n\nThen nothing at all.\n\n(:\"12 look\",12,\"You died from pheromone poisoning.\")",

Her moves are accentuating her curves, drawing attention to her round ass, her large breasts, her lithe body. The dance is delicate, yet so seductive, like a forgotten language spoken only through the body. “Once uponna time.”\n\nIn the flickering candlelight, Melka begins. Her bra and panties cling to her skin as she moves, straining with each gyration, each stretch, each arch of her back. Each movement reveals more of her green skin, barely preserving her modesty.\n\nAs she moves, a song slips from her lips in the old goblin tongue, wild and primal, thoroughly enchanting. *\"Groak Aldric Skulgaroth,\"* she begins, softly, her impish voice tinged with a note of admiration, almost reverence. It’s haunting.

I sink two fingers inside her, her tight warmth enveloping me.\n\nHer pussy clenches around my fingers as she sings, moaning softly while she does.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n\"Rhaatark gara zok,\" (As terrifying as he may be,)\n\"Zu'uka z'unn skrizzak lug,\" (I still want him,)\n\"Ura, zrag zhaakar zu'uk.\" (Yet, I promise not to steal him from his one true love.)\n\nShe gasps, her body jerking in surprise as my fingers explore her deeper. I can hear her moaning, the sound swallowed by the sweet notes of her song. She's hot, she's wet, and she's all mine, for just one night.\n\nThe height difference - I’m kneeling behind her, one hand still inside her, the other steadying her against me. Her thick thighs clench around my hand, the sensation sending another surge of arousal through me.\n\nAs I play with her, the song fades, her breath coming out in pants, the notes lost in the heavy silence of the room. All I can hear is her, all I can feel is her, and all I want is her.\n\nShe throws a look over her shoulder, her sparkling purple eyes clouded with desire and anticipation. The sight of her lips parting slightly, heavy breaths escaping them, sends a shiver down my spine. One of her small, green hands captures mine, her fingers intertwining with mine, guiding me deeper within her.\n\nHer goblin pussy is tight, incredibly so, clenching rhythmically around my fingers. It's velvet soft, the ridges and folds of her inner walls sending jolts of pleasure through me, a primal part of me reveling in the lewdness of it all.\n\nHer other hand disappears from my sight, only to reappear at the base of my hardening cock. She wraps her small hand around my length, positioning it between the round mounds of her green, sweat-slick ass. She tucks my cock beneath the thin fabric of her panties, nestling it snugly between her cheeks.\n\nThe feeling of her ass rubbing against my cock is intoxicating. Her ass is soft yet firm, the subtle squeeze of her cheeks sending sparks of pleasure through my body. She rocks back into me, her ass sliding up and down along my length. The friction, though light, stokes the heat within me, pushing me to the brink of my control.\n\nThe room is filled with soft, gasping moans, the heat between us growing with each passing second. Her voice, once melodic and singing, is now reduced to ragged breaths and soft pleas. My name, or rather my title, “Skulgaroth,” leaves her lips in a heated whisper, adding to the potent eroticism of the moment. It might be a little messed up that she’s calling me by name that strikes fear into her people.[Choice: Fondle her more.",

Her butt is raised, the round globes of her ass sticking out invitingly, her pussy peeking out from between her thighs. It's a darker shade of green, the slick folds glistening in the dim light. Her freckles, darker against her green skin, dot her buttocks and the backs of her thighs, giving her a delightfully exotic look.\n\nShe smirks at me, her eyes darting towards my rock-hard cock. \"Looks like yer hard, I guess ya can just go jerk off now, right?\" she teases.",

[[Image: borderless]\nWith a ragged breath, I nod in silent agreement to Melka's teasing suggestion.\n\nI know I need to regain some semblance of control, to separate the raw desire from the need to expel Grokk's toxic remnants. It's not right.\n\n\"Right,\" I say, my voice unsteady as I disentangle myself from her tempting form and move toward the privacy screen once again.\n\nBehind the screen, I attempt to focus.\n\nBut as soon as the distance grows between us, the warmth begins to ebb, and my cock starts going soft again.\n\n\"Damn it,\" I mutter under my breath, my fingers clumsily stroking in an attempt to revive my dwindling erection. The sounds of Melka shifting on the bed pierce through the thin veil of the screen.\n\nThen, the screen rustles slightly, and Melka peeks around it, her purple eyes wide with a mixture of concern and unfulfilled desire. Her dark, green freckles seem to stand out more against the flush of arousal still painted across her cheeks. She bites her lip, a playful yet petulant expression forming as she watches my faltering attempts.\n\n\"Aldric,\" she starts, her voice soft, \"you *really* don't have to do this all alone, ya know. I'm all ready to be your little cocksleeve if you need it.\" She gives a small, mischievous wiggle. \"It's fer yer health, ya know.

I glance down at myself, at the man who conquered beasts and battles but now stands defeated by his own goblin-corrupted physiology.\n\nI rush back over to her, grabbing her ass, feeling the smooth skin and the slight jiggle under my fingers.\n\nI'm hard again, almost instantly.\n\n*I tried enough, right? This is the only way.*\n\n\"See how wet I am?\"\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nShe poses on the bed, spreading her little purple pussy lips, and showing how her juices practically drool out...\n\nGently, I position the head of my cock at her entrance. A small whimper escapes her, her body tensing under me.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" I ask, my voice laced with concern. I pull out slightly, only to be met with a defiant gaze.\n\nHer eyes are misty but determined. \"I'm... I'm a virgin,\" she admits, the words barely a whisper.\n\nA flood of warmth courses through me, the realization sinking in. The tightness, the resistance I felt, it all makes sense now. She entrusted her first time to me, and it stirs something inside me, an unexpected intimacy that sends a shiver down my spine.\n\n[Choice: Enter her!",

Her bottom lip is trapped between her teeth, a thin line of drool escaping from the corner of her mouth. Her eyes are smoky, her pupils dilated with arousal. Her face is flushed, her freckles standing out against her green skin.\n\nThere's a wild look in her eyes, a mixture of pleasure, pain, and surprise that makes her look all the more beautiful.\n\nThen, without warning, she bucks her hips up against me. The sensation is jolting, the depth of it forcing a gasp from my lips. She's filled to the brim with me, my cock nestled deep within her quivering folds. She lets out a breathless moan, her small green hands gripping the sheets tightly. She's fully impaled on my cock, the sight of her, the feeling of her, it's all too much. It feels so fucking good.\n\nShe lets out a shaky breath, her body trembling beneath me. \"I want it rough,\" she whispers. \"Always wanted my first time to be rough. Don't go easy on me.\"\n\nMy fingers grope her jiggly, soft breasts. Her back arches off the bed, the smooth expanse of her green skin glistening under the dim light. Her body is a work of art, a sight to behold. Every smack of our bodies sends a wave of pleasure coursing through me.\n\nMy other hand moves down to her ass, giving it a firm squeeze. She lets out a yelp, the sound quickly morphing into a moan. The imprint of my hand forms on her green skin, a darker shade against her body.\n\nHer fat green breasts bounce deliciously with the force of my thrusts. The sight of her, her body bouncing and swaying under my ministrations, sends a jolt of vigor straight to my cock.\n\nMelka's moans and groans fill the room, a beautiful symphony of pleasure.\n\n\"I love it,\" she screams, her voice raw with pleasure. She looks back at me, her eyes filled with pure bliss, her mouth hanging open in a silent scream. \"Harder!\"\n\nWith every thrust, every movement, her body rocks against mine.

Take me, Skulgaroth! Stretch me out with your big human cock! Use my gobbo cunt as your fucking cocksleeve; just jerk off with my little pussy!\n\nThe term, 'Skulgaroth,' I think is taboo. I think she's getting off on using it. I think it means goblin-murderer or something. But I let it fuel me, feeding a raw, primal part of me.\n\nEach thrust makes her plump asscheeks jiggle and quake, her little toes curling as they danlge.\n\n\"Yes, yes, *fuck* me!\" she screeches, turning her head to look at me, her eyes wild with lust. \"Use me! This is just a jack off session!\"\n\nIn her voice, in her debased pleas, there’s a release of all her repressed desires, her fantasies of being wanted by someone, of being used by someone.\n\n\"Ahhhnn!\" Melka's cries rise up to become sharp, ecstatic shrieks. The noise is overwhelming, and a quick flick of panic crosses my mind—the whole inn will hear us!\n\n\"Quiet down!\" I command, spanking her. The sound of my hand against her skin echoes, a satisfying clap that only makes her moan louder.\n\n\"Call me your little gobbo slut first,\" she pleads, her eyes rolling back in bliss.\n\n\"You're my little gobbo slut,\" I growl, each word punctuated with a thrust, sinking balls deep into her, feeling her purple gobbo pussy squeeze and tug at me like a vise. \"So shut up when I tell you to shut up!\"\n\n\"Nnnghhh!! Ok!!!\" she moans as her feet wobble in the air. ]I swallow hard, feeling the wildness in me urge to take her hard just like she's asking. But I decide to \"test the waters\" first and make sure she's ok.\n\nI make the call for both of us; this is Melka's first time! She doesn't probably even know what rough feels like, and I'm not about to traumatize the goblin girl that I'm deflowering.\n\nGently, I pull her to me. I sit her down in my lap, her small form fitting perfectly against my larger frame.\n\nShe gazes into my eyes from over her shoulder, uncertainty mingling with anticipation.\n\nI feel her nervousness, the rapid beat of her heart against my fingers, and I'm reminded of the depths of her trust in this moment. I wrap my arms around her, holding her securely, a silent vow to protect her even in this intimate act.\n\nWith a tender kiss on her neck, I put my hands on her hips, showing her how to move. She takes a breath, braces herself on my shoulders, and tentatively begins to rock her hips.\n\nAs she slowly rides, gaining confidence, I moan louder, emphasizing each motion to reassure her of her effect on me. I exaggerate my responses, even though it *does* feel amazing - she's so tight, tighter than any human. Her eyes sparkle with a mix of thrill and pride as she hears me groan.\n\nI lift her into the air, letting her ride my cock as I stand.\n\nOur lips meet in a messy, slobbery kiss, the kind that's more about shared breaths and whispered moans than technique.\n\n“F-fill me, Skulgaroth,” Melka gasps out, her voice breathy but strained with effort. Despite her plea for roughness, there's a softness to her tone, a trusting vulnerability that tugs at my heartstrings.\n\nI hold her perky green asscheeks as I suspend her in the air, guiding her movements. She moans loudly, the sound bouncing off the walls and filling the room with the melody of her ecstasy. With each ride, I feel her body stretching, adapting to my size, her warmth enveloping me. Her juices coat me, a warm, slick welcome that encourages deeper exploration. Her jiggly green tits press against my chest.\n\nThe scene is bathed in the midnight glow of candlelight, casting a soft, golden hue across her jiggling green breasts and flushed purple face. Each movement she makes is illuminated, her green skin a canvas of erotic light and shadows.\n\n“Yeah, just like that… You’re doing so well- nggh!” I grunt. I lean in to capture her lips in a kiss, tasting that raw goblin wildness.\n\n“Skulgaroth… it feels so good,” she whimpers into my ear, her breath hot and heavy. I can’t help but chuckle, the endearment amusing yet fitting in its strange way.\n\n*It's better than 'Tit-bitch', at least...*\n\nI grip her hips, steadying her rhythm into something less frantic, more measured. Her eyes cross slightly as I hit a particularly sensitive spot inside her, her mouth falling open in a silent 'O'. The sight is heartbreakingly adorable—the fierce goblin warrior lost in the throes of her first climax.\n\n[Choice: Switch positions.",

She bites her lower lip, her dainty green hands pulling apart her ass cheeks, showing me her wet, inviting pussy. The shiny lavender of her inner folds stands out against the green of her pussy lips, a tantalizing sight that has my cock throbbing with need.\n\nHer breasts spill out from the tiny strip of cloth stretched over them, bouncing with the rhythm of my thrusts.

My balls slap heavily against her, squelching as I hammer her pussy. Melka's moans rise in pitch, turning into screams of ecstasy, her body convulsing beneath me as she reaches her second climax.\n\nThe build-up inside me reaches its peak, a volcanic pressure\n\nAnd then, with a deep, guttural roar, I unload into her. The feeling is revelatory, an intense release that seems to pull the dark, acidic buildup from my veins with every pulse of my hips.\n\nBLUUURRRRRT... BLURRRTTT... BLURRRRRT... SPLURRT...\n\nMy orgasm is monstrous, ropes of cum launching into Melka with a force that leaves us both gasping. The release feels almost excretory, a purge of built-up toxins, the pheromones that Grokk's essence had infected me with being expelled forcefully with each spurt of dark, off-white cum.\n\nMelka's eyes roll back in her head, her body slackening beneath me as the waves of her orgasm mingle with mine. \"So... much...\" she gasps, her voice a hoarse whisper, her body slick with a sheen of sweat in the low light.\n\n\"Y-yeah...\" I pant, slumping down onto her. The mating press keeps us tightly connected, my cock still twitching inside her as the last of my climax drips out.\n\nShe giggles weakly, a sound that is half-delirious with spent pleasure. \"Look at it... your cum, it's... so much...\"\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nGlancing down, I see it, the cum bubbling up from within her, dark and thick. Panic flares briefly in my chest. \"Shit, is that... safe?\"\n\nShe laughs, a low, raspy sound. \"Naw, goblin pheromones only work on non-gobbos - weird, right?\" She's panting hard, her green body glistening with sweat, her hair plastered to her forehead. \"Doesn't affect me whatsoever.\"\n\nI collapse beside her, both of us catching our breath, the room filled with the heavy scent of sex and sweat. I feel cleansed, lighter, as if a great weight has been lifted. The lingering effects of the goblin pheromones seem diminished, almost gone.\"No,\" I respond, shaking my head. Even in the throes of pleasure, I can't ignore the loyalty I still hold for my wife, for Elara. This is survival, not infidelity. I need to do this to live. Right?\n\nMelka doesn't seem deterred by my rejection. Her legs wrap tighter around me, holding me in place as I continue to piston into her. \"Do it,\" she insists, her voice shaky from her own impending climax.\n\nHer pussy clenches around me, her body shaking as a powerful orgasm tears through her. Her screams fill the room, her back arching off the bed as she rides out the waves of pleasure. Her claws dig into my abs, her tiny arms not quite able to reach around my wide frame.\n\nThe sight of her in such ecstasy is breathtaking. Her eyes screw shut, her teeth bared in a silent scream, her entire body shaking. I can see it all in our reflection in the mirror - her splayed out beneath me, her tits bouncing and jiggling, her legs shaking.\n\nIn that moment, I know I'm close. Very close. I can feel the toxins pooling there, ready to be expelled. My body is purging itself, cleansing itself of the alien substance that had been killing me from the inside out. And all it took was the catalyst of this little green vixen beneath me.\n\nMy muscles are shaking, energy coursing through me in intense waves. My heart pounds in my chest like a war drum, echoing the primal rhythm of my primal need. I'm close, so close to releasing. I know Melka is still in the throes of her own release, her petite body writhing under me. I can feel her legs clamping around my waist, her feet pressing into the small of my back. She wants me to spill inside her, but I can't. I won't.\n\nI grunt, a low, guttural sound of exertion, gently unwrapping her legs from around me. My fingers brush over the smooth, green skin of her soles, still twitching and tensing from her orgasm. I can feel the heat of her, the goosebumps raised on her skin. Her toes curl and uncurl as I free myself from her grip.\n\n\"I need to...\" I huff out the words, a thread of a thought hanging in the heated air of the room. I don't finish the sentence. I don't have to. She knows what I mean.\n\nI stand, suddenly feeling the world tilt and sway under me. My knees almost buckle, my muscles threatening to give out. I'm not sure if it's the adrenaline crash or the goblin toxins seeping back into my system, but I feel weak, shaky. Still, I hold myself upright, one hand bracing on the wooden bedpost, the other hand wrapped around my throbbing cock.\n\n\"No, Aldric,\" Melka whimpers, a soft plea. \"On me, please.\"\n\nI glance down at her. She's still laid out on the bed, a vision of wanton desire. Her thick black hair is spread out on the pillow beneath her head, her wide purple eyes glittering with unshed tears. Her lips are parted, panting, a flush on her cheeks. She looks... breathtaking, like a painting of some forgotten little goddess.\n\n\"Melka, I...\"\n\nShe's quick, kneeling in front of me. My name is a soft prayer on her lips as she looks up at me. Her hands cup her breasts, pressing them together, her dark nipples hard and pointed. I feel my gut tighten at the sight of her, at the desperate desire burning in her eyes.\n\n\"I want to feel it,\" she whispers, her words a desperate plea. \"I want to feel you, Aldric.\"\n\nI know it's wrong, I know I shouldn't, but her words, her gaze, it all breaks down my resolve.\n\nI can feel it coming, the deep rumble of my impending release, my entire body coiled up like a powerful spring. Every muscle tenses, my toes curl against the rough wooden floor. It feels like a wildfire tearing through my body, destroying everything in its path, a purifying conflagration. It's not the simple pleasure I used to know, it's a thousand times more potent, sharp and keen like a lightning bolt.\n\n\"Alright,\" I rasp out, hoarse, unable to resist her pleading eyes any longer. My hand shakes as I point my cock directly at her, a target painted in bright green against the brown backdrop of the room.\n\nThen, with a raw, animalistic grunt, I let go. The sensation is overwhelming, even painful. Hot. Burning. My cock pulses, throbbing as it expels the thick, toxic evidence of Grokk's influence from my body. It's an expulsion, a violent rejection, purifying and cleansing.\n\nI watch as the thick ropes of my release shoot out, a hideous cocktail of milky white and strange tinges of yellow and gray-green. It lands on her, the squelching sounds shockingly loud in the quiet room, staining her once beautiful green skin with an unappealing glaze. It's an assault, violent and unyielding, but she just whimpers softly, accepting it, even welcoming it. Her wide purple eyes never leave mine as my cum paints her face and her breasts.\n\nI feel lighter, like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders. A sense of relief washes over me, followed by a wave of embarrassment and shame. The smell is pungent, making me wince. I don't even recognize it as my own.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n\"I... I'm sorry, Melka,\" I mutter, panting heavily. My body feels like jelly, muscles quivering from the powerful climax.\n\nThe aftermath of my release feels like the silence after a storm, where every sound is heightened and every sight seems sharper.\n\nMelka kneels on the bed, a strange mix of beauty and obscenity. Her skin, normally a beautiful, lush green, is covered in my cum, the substance splattered haphazardly across her chest and face, stringy trails of it dripping off her upturned nose and full lips. She's blinking rapidly, probably to keep the cum out of her eyes, and her purple eyes are wide, full of emotions I can't quite decipher.\n\nThe once-white band around her breasts is soaked through, clinging to her large round breasts like a second skin. It's darker now, stained with my cum, and as she breathes heavily, it moves with her, wet and squelchy. Cum runs down from her breasts in small streams, pooling around her hips and thighs.\n\nThe cum itself is grotesque, a disturbing mix of white and gray-green, still steaming slightly from the heat of my body. It's thick, almost curdled, clinging to her skin like glue. Its scent is pungent, sour and sickeningly sweet, and she wrinkles her upturned nose at the smell. I can't help but wince at the sight of it, this vivid evidence of my recent past. [Choice: She giggles.",

You feel so good.\n\n\"Did ya... did ya like the eye contact? Thought it was quite hot, myself,\" she adds with a little giggle, batting those big, expressive purple eyes at me. She's a ball of energy, bubbling over with exhilaration. It's like she's just discovered a whole new world.\n\nIt's a sight, watching her like this. A goblin girl in the throes of post-coital bliss, recounting every moment of her first time. The way she talks about being fucked, about the feeling of someone inside her... it's disarmingly honest.\n\nFunny in a way - endearing, too.\n\nShe's always been overlooked, but she's got a spirit in her that I've never seen in any woman, human or not.\n\nAs she starts cleaning herself up in the washbasin, I find myself grinning, a warm, fuzzy feeling bubbling up in my chest. It's been a long time since I've felt this light, this relaxed. She's a sight, Melka is, in all her naked, giggling glory.\n\nI let her prattle on while she washes, chuckling as I sink back into my bed, the covers soft against my skin. Exhaustion begins to tug at my eyelids, but I resist, watching her. \"I'm glad, Melka,\" I finally say, my words barely above a whisper.\n\nHer joy fills the room, her laughter ringing out as she keeps on dancing.\n\nFinally, she pauses, panting and flushed.\n\n\"Even though it was just once, I'm so glad it was you, Aldric.\"\n\nAnd with those words, she snuffs out the candles, plunging the room into darkness.\n\nBut the giggling from her own bed still fills the space, a comforting, happy sound that follows me into sleep.\n\n[Choice: Drift off...",

The thought fills me with more joy than it should.\n\nI squint, the sunlight forming a dazzling kaleidoscope through the thick emerald canopy of pine needles overhead. A pair of jewel-toned Hummingdrakes flit past, their ruby and sapphire wings catching the sunlight as they dance in the crisp air. The scent of damp moss, pine, and the faint sweetness of dawnbells waft through my nostrils, grounding me in familiar scents. My heart gives a squeeze in my chest. I'm home. Almost.\n\nBeneath us, the muscled back of the desert horse shifts, its steady trot a comforting rhythm. Melka sits in front of me, her body snug against mine. Her plump green ass rubs against my thighs, a dull throb from last night's exertions pulsing in my groin.\n\nThe memory of her naked flesh beneath me - the taste of her green lips, her ample breasts, the feel of her pussy around my cock - sends a jolt of desire through me. Guilt follows quickly after.\n\nI'm not hers. I belong to Elara.\n\nBut damn, last night will definitely have a space in my memory for the rest of my life. And considering all the other things I've done to survive these last few weeks... this seems like a failing I can accept.\n\n\"Ya think Thuulk will really take a goblin lass?\" Melka asks, breaking the silence.\n\n“It’s a melting pot, Melka. Folk of all kinds live there,\" I reassure, my hand resting on her rounded shoulder. The rough fabric of her tunic is warm under my palm. \"Your skills as a healer... they'll be more than welcome. That’s what they’ll care about.”\n\nHer shoulder stiffens under my touch and then relaxes. She lets out a sigh, her body sagging against me. The image of the goblin girl in the busy streets of Thuulk flashes in my mind - her short black curls bouncing as she navigates through the crowd, her purple eyes sparkling with excitement.\n\n\"But if you ever want a taste of country life, remember you're always welcome in Eboncrest. Our home is yours,\" I add, feeling her stiffen once more. I should really just shut up.\n\n[Choice: She sighs.",

And she’s not gonna wanna see a goblin.”\n\nA lump forms in my throat. She's absolutely right.\n\nI take a deep breath, drinking in the forest air. It tastes of freedom, of homecoming, and of a strange, unexpected camaraderie born out of shared adversity. Dressed in the fresh cotton shirt and comfortable leather britches gifted by the Thistlecross guards, I feel like myself again. Aldric. Not Elise. Not a battered slave, but a man returning home.\n\n)\"Yer cock did a number on me, Tit-bitch,” she says, a chuckle in her voice. She pats her round ass, still tender from our tryst. \"Can't sit on this saddle without feeling like I got pounded by a stone troll.\"\n\nHeat rises to my cheeks, my cock gives a stir at her words. The tension crackles between us. It's friendly, flirtatious, and tinged with a sexual frisson that neither of us can deny. I cough, trying to dispel the embarrassment.\n\n\"Maybe I should've been gentler for your first time,\" I say, trying to keep the conversation light.\n\n\"Nah,\" she retorts, glancing back at me, her purple eyes twinkling. \"I got what I asked for.”\"Ye were gentle with me last night, I know it,\" she says, chuckling. \"But I liked it. If ye went all out, think I'd be havin' trouble sittin on this saddle...\"\n\nHeat rises to my cheeks, my cock gives a stir at her words. The tension crackles between us.

I hate them.\"\n\nThe silence stretches between us, pregnant with the tension of words left unsaid. A bird chirps, piercing the stillness. We are getting very close.\n\n\"So, what's yer woman like, then? Elara.",

It's a turn of phrase,\" I explain. “It means good with plants.”\n\n“Humans,” she huffs.\n\n“Let me tell you one story about Elara,” I start, my brain just enjoying that I can remember everything again. “So, as I said, she loves things that grow, anything from a tree to a weed. Can't bear to let any plant die, no matter how pathetic. One day, she finds this shriveled potted plant outside a magic shop in town. Looks like it hadn't seen water in months. I tried telling her to leave it. That nothing good ever came from a magic shop, but Elara... well, she's stubborn as a mule when she sets her mind to something.\"\n\n“So what happened?”\n\n\"Well,\" I say. \"She brings it home, sets it on the windowsill, waters it, talks to it. Sings to it. Two weeks later, that thing is sprouting like crazy. Green shoots all over, looking healthier than any other plant in our garden.\"\n\n\"Sounds like Elara's got some magic of her own.\"\n\n“She does,\" I agree, a warmth spreading in my chest at the thought of my wife's gentle heart. “A bit too much of it. One day the following week, I wake up to find our garden absolutely wrecked. Pots shattered, dirt everywhere. And at the center of it all, that damn plant, now grown into a giant tentacle monster, thrashing about and flinging our tomatoes all over the place.\"\n\n“A Fumblethorn!” Melka lets out a high-pitched squeal of laughter, slapping her knee.\n\n“Exactly,” I say, rolling my eyes at the memory. “And she wouldn’t even let me kill it. I had to grapple with the beast, get it into a sack. It was thrashing and squirming, knocking me flat on my ass more than once. It ate all of Elara's petunias, and she still wanted to save it.”\n\nMelka's giggling becomes uncontrollable at this point, her body shaking with mirth. \"And then?\"\n\n\"Then? Well, I had to spend a whole day marching it out into the wild and let it go. Elara told me it needed to go into a dungeon, where it could wrap around stalagmites, curl around stalagmites and suck nutrients or some such nonsense. And the spores, don’t get me started!” I continue to detail the harrowing quest, of planting monsters rather than slaying them. Of my wife’s hand over hips to ensure I had followed through with my promise.\n\nBy the end of the story, Melka is wiping tears from her eyes, the fits of giggles finally subsiding. I feel lighter than I've felt in ages, the story serving as a reminder of the life that's waiting for me, of the love that I still have.\"Er...\" I mumble. \"I'd better not.\n\nShe nods, and we both enjoy a comfortable silence for a while.\n\nIt's home.\n\n[Choice: My home.",

He delivers a sharp military salute, his armored hand thumping against his breastplate in welcome.\n\n\"Knew you'd get out of that pickle, Aldric!\" chimes in another, Roderick, a grizzled veteran with scars to match. His grip is strong and warm on my forearm as we share a hearty clasp.\n\nThey're all here, my brothers-in-arms. Duncan, the hawk-eyed archer. Jonah, the stoic blacksmith's son. They’re grinning, laughing, their faces etched with relief and joy.\n\n\"Hold up there, men!\" A new voice rings out above the clamor. Captain Giles. The soldiers part like the sea, making way for the captain of the guard, his stern features softened by a rare smile. \"You're a sight for sore eyes, Aldric.\"\n\n\"Giles!\" I greet him, clapping him on the shoulder. \"The town hasn't burned down without me, has it?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Giles replies with a smirk. \"Though we did have a bit of a problem with a green-skinned fellow earlier.\"\n\nMy heart leaps. \"Snib.”\n\n“Right.

But she'll be over the moon, seeing you back.\"\n\n\"Good.

Gently, I push it open - we’ve never had to keep it locked, in such a safe town.\n\nInside, the familiar scent of our hearth, a mix of burning oak and rosemary bread, washes over me like a warm, comforting blanket.\n\nCreeping through the living area, my eyes take in the familiar setup: plush furniture, warm tapestries, the fire dancing in the hearth.\n\nA soft hum leads me to the kitchen. My breath catches in my throat as I drink in the sight of her, auburn locks cascading down her shoulders, focused on the loaf of bread she's kneading on the table. My heart clenches as I imagine her eating it alone.\n\nThe floor creaks under my foot, breaking the silence. Elara jumps, a sharp shriek piercing the air. I rush forward, my arms open to catch her as she stumbles back. The shriek dies in her throat as she turns, her eyes meeting mine. \"Al- Aldric?\"\n\nTears pool in her eyes, her hands trembling as they reach up to touch my face. \"You're... you're back?\" I nod, my heart aching at the disbelief in her voice. My fingers curl around hers, pressing her palm against my cheek.\n\nHer scream transforms into a sob, her body shaking as she buries herself in my arms. I wrap her up, pulling her as close as I can. Her body fits perfectly against mine, her curves melding into my muscles, her scent clouding my senses. Home.\n\nShe pulls back, her hands framing my face as her sapphire eyes search my face. \"I didn't dare to hope, Aldric. But I was praying for your return. I haven't slept.\"\n\nHer confession tugs at my heart, regret and relief warring inside me. I pull her back into my embrace, burying my face in her hair. \"I'm here, Elara. I'm here now. Here forever.”\n\nHer fingers curl into my shirt, her body clinging to mine as if I might disappear like a puff of smoke.\n\nThen, we kiss. It's a desperate kiss to make up for lost time, a clash of lips and tongues that speaks of the torment of our separation. The taste of her, sweet and familiar, fills me with a burning need. I pull her closer, deepening the intimacy. It's so good to have her in my arms again. And to have *my arms* again.\n\nThe taste of her lips, the smell of her hair, the feel of her body against mine... it all confirms that I'm finally home, finally free.\n\nAnd yet, beneath the joy and relief, a dark thought lurks. Snib. In chains, thankfully. The thought of his vile hands on my Elara fills me with a cold, seething rage. I have no doubt that’s what he was attempting in his little sneak attack.\n\nWe settle down on our couch as I recount, carefully, the events of the last few days at the horrible Griznak Gobboree.\n\n[Choice: Recount the details...",

That’s when Snib lost me, and I was given to Grokk, their chieftain.”\n\nI kiss her forehead softly, not planning to talk about getting face-fucked in front of the jeering crowd.\n\n\"It was horrible,\" I say, my heart aching at her shiver. \"But I escaped - thankfully, goblins are jealous of each other, and actually it was Snib who freed me, to get revenge on the chief.

There, amidst the chaos of parchments and ink, sits something that makes my breath catch in my throat.\n\nThe collar.\n\nI stiffen at the sight of it.\n\nZephyrion is seated behind the desk, engrossed in a scroll. At our entrance, he looks up and stands.\n\n\"Aldric. Elara,\" he greets. His voice is measured and controlled, each word carefully articulated, echoing softly around the room. There's an urgency in his demeanor, like he's impatient to get back to whatever was occupying him before we arrived.\n\nHe's taller than I'd remembered. His grey eyes flicker with a glint of hidden knowledge, a storm beneath a calm facade.\n\nShaking off the unease, I rshake his hand. His touch is cool, his skin smooth against my calloused hands. \"Zephyrion,\" I return the greeting, forcing a small smile. \"How long has it been? Ten years?\"\n\nAs our hands drop, my eyes drift to the insignia on his shoulder. It's a symbol I've seen before, one that's known across the kingdom. A silver lightning bolt wrapped around a golden scepter. The emblem of King Richard Valarian’s inner council.\n\nMy brow furrows slightly. Just how high up is he?\n\nElara is next to me, her arm threading through mine as she nods a hello. Zephyrion acknowledges her with a tilt of his head, his expression unchanging. His gaze sweeps back to me, lingering for a fraction of a second longer than necessary before it shifts away.\n\nMy gaze goes back to the collar on his desk, my mind reeling. \"Shouldn't that thing be locked away?\" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. The metal glimmers in the dim light, almost mocking, its silence whispering tales of my past. I resist the urge to reach out and grab it, to throw it far away from us, from this room.\n\nBut Zephyrion only raises an eyebrow at my question, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. \"Aldric,\" he begins, leaning back in his chair, his grey eyes dancing with a spark of intrigue. \"That's what we're here to find out, isn't it?\"\n\nThe wizard’s gaze fixes on the cursed collar, his stormy eyes sparkling with an ominous light. He reaches out, his long fingers hovering a hair’s breadth above the cruel iron, stopping short of touching it.\n\n\"Marvelous, isn't it? As a thing,\" he murmurs, a grim smile tugging at the corner of his lips. The word feels wrong, feels dirty, in reference to that damned collar. \"So simple, yet so... potent.\" His eyes flick to mine, his smile fading. \"You wore it well, Aldric. So the goblin says.”\n\nHis words scrape at me like a knife. But I don’t flinch, don’t blink, just meet his gaze head on.\n\n\"Indeed,\" he continues, his eyes returning to the collar. \"Fendril was correct, as far as he went. It's a conduit, a bridge to something... more. An ancient being. But I have discovered who this being is.”\n\nMy wife and I hold our breath.\n\n“Maraan.\"\n\n[Choice: You've heard that name before...",

No link to Maraan, no power to study, to use. The collar must be active, or else it sleeps.\"\n\nA leaden silence follows his words. I swallow hard, my throat dry. Zephyrion’s gaze falls back onto the collar, his fingers itching to touch it, to trace its runes.\n\nZephyrion settles into his seat, his grey eyes scanning the room like a hawk scanning the forest floor. His lips part, drawing our attention, each word he releases, a sharpened arrow.\n\n\"Time, Aldric, is a cruel and relentless taskmaster,\" he starts, the room swallowing his words in silent anticipation. \"It respects neither king nor peasant, neither wizard nor warrior.

For months.”\n\n\"The Serrans,\" he continues, \"persistent as they are, have matched us blow for blow. No side has tasted a single decisive victory, only the bitter brew of attrition.\" His words paint a grim image, one that's hard to swallow. “The counteroffensive has failed.”\n\nHis stern gaze holds us captive as he weaves this tapestry of harsh reality.\n\n\"There are alliances forming in the east with the warlords, alliances that threaten to tear Valaria asunder.

He looks to me, then to Elara, and finally, to the eldritch artifact resting on the table.\n\n“King Richard Valarian has summoned us, his council of wizards, not just to fight but to uncover.

It only binds to one wearer.”\n\n“And one master,” I echo his previous words.\n\nThe room plunges into an icy silence. I can hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears, the blood draining from my face. Beside me, Elara inhales sharply, her hand gripping mine.\n\n“Sorry, but are you fucking mad?\" Elara's voice is a whip, snapping across the room. Her fingers dig into my hand, her other one shaking as she points at the cursed collar. “My husband was tortured, transformed, for DAYS! You want him to go through that hell again?\"\n\nZephyrion is unfazed by her outburst. His gaze remains focused on me, patient and expectant. \"It's only temporary, Aldric,\" he assures, his voice like silk. \"Just until we unlock its secrets.\"\n\n\"I won't wake Maraan,\" I say, standing up abruptly. My chair topples backward, echoing my outrage in the cold stone room. \"The stories... we're told not to wake him. The K'tarrans are a warning, not an example.\"\n\nZephyrion merely shakes his head, a slight, arrogant smile playing on his lips. “Scholars believe the K'tarran empire fell due to economic collapse, internal strife, and famine. The disasters that befell them were purely mundane, not mystical.\"\n\n\"That's horseshit!\" I snap, slamming my fist on the table. \"The Three swallowed them whole! They abused their power and were obliterated for it!\"\n\nSilence settles again. I can feel Elara's fear and anger pulsing beside me, mirroring my own. She finally breaks the silence, her voice thick with tears.\n\n\"Aldric has given enough to the war,\" she pleads. \"He trains soldiers, he's the hero of this town. I've shared him with the kingdom for years, and I won't do it anymore. I need my husband.\"\n\nZephyrion just looks at us, as calm as a millpond.

Cold. It's so bloody cold. Then, I can feel it, coursing through me. The sickening pull of magic, the same magic that had once before transformed me, ripping me from the form I'd known for a lifetime.\"I won't let this happen,\" I declare, my voice a resolute growl. I stand firm, my legs planted wide apart, my fists clenched at my sides.\n\n\"Aldric,\" Zephyrion says softly, his voice like the whisper of a blade sliding into a sheath. \"This is bigger than our simple human fears and discomforts.

My eyes widen, a pit of dread opening in my stomach, swallowing my thoughts, my breath, everything.\n\n\"No! NO!\" The roar that tears from my throat is filled with the remnants of Aldric, the hero, the warrior who would not be broken. I reach for the collar, my fingers grasping at the metal as it moves closer. I struggle, claws digging into the air, fighting against the invisible force guiding it to me. My muscles scream in protest, veins popping out of my neck, every fiber of my being straining to stop it as I wrestle with the magic holding me in place.\n\nUnfortunately, Zephyrion’s power is immense.\n\nMy fingers scrape against the cold iron, trying to push it away, but it's like trying to hold back a tidal wave with my bare hands.

The collar is inches away now, a monstrous, suffocating weight pressing down on my soul. I struggle harder, my knees buckle, but I don’t fall. I won't fall. I won't let this happen.\n\nThe collar clamps shut. The moment it closes around my throat, my roar dies in my throat, replaced by a sound that's a grotesque parody of a scream—high-pitched, strangled, the sound of Aldric being ripped away, piece by brutal piece.\n\n[Choice: The change is immediate...",

I see the raw terror in her beautiful eyes.\n\nBut I can't do a bloody thing.\n\nThat's when the pain hits me. Unbearable, unimaginable pain that brings me to my knees - well, it would, if I wasn't being suspended in the air. My stomach lurches, the pain is blinding, I can't breathe. My muscles contract, my bones ache.\n\nMy entire body is convulsing, and I feel it - the change.\n\nA wave of energy rips through me with the fury of a thousand storms. It's like being flayed alive and reborn in an instant. I’m clutching at my throat as if I could tear the damned thing off.\n\nIt seems to begin with my feet. I feel them steadily dissolve into delicate, fragile appendages. My sturdy boots loosen and almost slide off. I watch helplessly. These are *woman’s* feet, made for dainty slippers, not combat boots.\n\nThe pain swells, rising up my legs. My ankles shrink, slendering into delicate joints. My calves soften, losing their muscular definition as the skin takes on the smooth, hairless texture. I can almost hear the sinews and tendons shifting, restructuring themselves.\n\nThe transformation sweeps up my legs, my sturdy calves thinning out, the muscles giving way to softer, rounder contours. The pain is punctuated by the sound of my brown leather britches tearing, the expanding flesh of my thighs and ass busting through the seams.\n\nMy ass balloons outward, losing the rough firmness of a fighter and replacing it with a lush softness. My hips widen dramatically, the fabric of my britches splitting entirely apart and morphing into a hyper-short leather skirt that clings obscenely to my new curves, fluttering high above my round, jiggly asscheeks, which are now almost completely exposed.\n\n\"Welcome back, cow tits,\" Snib's horrid voice echoes through the room, but I’m barely aware. My whimpering pants are drowned out by my own distress, my eyes clenching shut to shut out the changes. Somewhere, Elara screams, her wailing turning into tears. But the change doesn’t care.\n\nIt’s relentless, determined to reshape me completely.\n\nEach muscle in my stomach gives way, the toned ridges of my abs softening, melting into a flat, smooth belly. My hands clutching at my shirt, the callouses peeling away, replaced by soft, delicate skin. My fingers grow slender, as if made for painting and sewing, not for wielding a sword. I feel my grip weaken, and with a dull clang, Whisperwind falls from my grasp.\n\n\"Stop this!\" Elara screams, her voice breaking as tears stream down her face. But it's no use. My transformation is far from over.\n\nMy chest... oh gods, my chest. It's happening again. The flat, muscular expanse of my chest is bubbling, swelling outward. The fabric of my shirt strains, tighter and tighter, until with a loud rip, my new breasts burst forth. They're enormous, huge and heavy and jiggling with each ragged breath. My nipples harden against the cold air, pebbling on the large mounds.\n\nIf anything, they're bigger than before.\n\nA throbbing ache begins at my groin, and a horrible realization dawns on me. The last vestige of my manhood is disappearing.\n\nMy cock... I can feel it... it shrinks back into me, an unbearable suction feeling, as if my very soul is being pulled into my body. And then, there's a hollow feeling, a void where my manhood once stood. My manhood is gone, replaced by the slick, tender folds of a woman's pussy mound.\n\nJust as the last remnants of my manhood disappear, my body convulses again, more violently this time. I can't even scream, can't even voice my pain. A gasp tears from my throat as my clothes begin to change, my ripped leather britches morphing into a short leather skirt, the belt tightening around my newly formed waist, cinching in the soft flesh. My torn shirt transforms into a bikini top, barely able to contain my massive breasts.\n\nJust as I think the torture might end, the eldritch energy pulses outward, reshaping my torn clothing. The fabric of my brown britches morphs, crawling up my newly broadened hips, shrinking into a too-short miniskirt that clings to my every jiggle. My tattered shirt reforms, warping into a scandalously thin bikini top that barely houses the huge breasts that strain against it.\n\nSuspended in midair through Zephyrion's levitating grip, I'm Elise again. My body, twisted into an obscene exaggeration of male fantasies, a perfect, voluptuous, breedable sexpot, is on full display. Each curve, each bouncing bit of flesh... ugh.\n\nNot again.\n\nWith a soft thump, I'm released, collapsing onto the cold stone floor, sobbing, defeated.\n\nI am no longer Aldric. I am Elise once again. Snib's pet, the goblin's toy. Trapped in a body that's not mine, forced to live a life I don't want. This isn't fair. It's not bloody fair. And as I lie there, the horrible reality of my situation sets in. This is my life now, once again. As Elise.\n\n[Choice: Your life becomes a whole new hell...",

The sight sends spasms of revulsion through me, stops my breath, but nothing compares to the shocking realization that follows. The pendulous weight on my chest - fat, soft, milksop mounds - hanging heavily. I give a horrible gasp, tears welling in my eyes as reality slams into me like a battle-axe.\n\n\"Oh gods...\" I whisper, feeling a lump in my throat expand. It wasn't a dream.\n\nOh, the bitter,* bitter* mockery... waking up next to my wife, who, even in sleep paints the epitome of pristine feminine grace. There's a youthfulness about her, a freshness that brings me back to our days when life was simple.\n\nPropped up on an elbow, I watch until my wife stirs, a soft sigh escaping her lips as her sapphire eyes blink open. She looks at me, and there it is- the sudden jolt, the widening of her eyes. The sinking realization.\n\nAll over again.\n\nElara's fingers twitch, clenching in the soft sheets beneath us. And then she's reaching, her gaze captivated by the unbelievable roundness that obscures most of my torso, her hand sliding under the fabric of my nightgown, and she's cupping me. The skin-to-skin contact sends a jolt of sensation, hot and potent, up my spine. Any other time, this could be ecstasy - biting my lower lip, my back arches involuntarily. But this is aching, this is hell.\n\n\"Elise...\" she whispers, the sound barely escaping her lips, the corners of her mouth trembling.\n\nMy breast, grotesquely large, fills her palm completely, my nipple hardens on contact, pushing against the warm confines of her hand. Her fingers, they have to spread to accommodate the sheer size of my tit flesh spilling out.\n\nHer face turns into something that's akin to horror, stark and blatant, at the obscene size of my bosoms.\n\n\"It's... it's bigger than before, isn't it?\" she asks, her touch slipping away, snatching her hand back as if she'd touched fire. The absence of her touch leaves me chilled, more alone than ever.\n\nTears drip down my cheeks. I give a ragged choke, fisting the sheets. I can’t believe this happened. Again.\n\nElara suddenly moves closer, timid at first, unsure in her every move. I feel her breath against my cheek, heart pounding out a staccato rhythm against the tight confines of the uncomfortable nightgown. Her lips part and find mine, tasting the salt of my tears.\n\nHer kiss isn't quite right. It doesn't feel like how it used to. It's too soft, too full. So much lushness beneath her touch, it sickens me and yet... I lean in, craving for the familiar comfort only Elara can give me. Through the stinging humiliation and knotted trepidation, I want... this.",

Our breasts mash together, the sensation strange, yet undeniably... hot.\n\nShe plays along, fingers skimming the delicate curve of my waist and dipping lower to rest on my plump, jiggly ass. The feel of her gripping my sensitive flesh sends a bolt through me, making me gasp against her lips.\n\n*Am I more sensitive this time around?*\n\nOur breaths mingle, the space between us shrinking until there's nothing but skin and heat.\n\nElara's sapphire eyes are half-lidded with desire, her fingers slipping under my silky nightgown to find the warmth of my thigh. As I undress her too, my hips begin to move instinctively, grinding against her, feeling the slick warmth gathering between my thighs.\n\n\"Aldric...\" Elara breathes, as our breasts continue to squish and compress.\n\nHer hand traces the curve of my back, tugging at the thin strap of my nightgown. It slides off my shoulder easily, the fabric gliding down to reveal the full enormity of my breast.\n\nHer fingers tremble against my flesh, her eyes never leaving mine as she slips another hand up to my chest. She cups my breast, squeezing gently, the sensation making me arch against her. \"I need you,\" she whispers, and I respond by pushing her back onto the bed, my lips finding her neck, my hands working to free her from the last remaining barriers of cloth.\n\nWe're a tangle of limbs, lips, and labored breaths, each touch, each whisper a desperate plea for more. My hips grind against hers, the action a desperate bid for closeness, for some kind of unity in this ridiculous situation. Her fingers slip between my legs, finding the slick heat waiting there, stroking, teasing. I gasp, my body arching into her touch, the pleasure overwhelming.\n\nJust as I'm about to pull her dress over her head, to lose ourselves completely, the door to our room crashes open with a loud bang.\n\nIn that jarringly obscene moment, Snib’s grating voice slices through our sanctuary, louder and more obnoxious than ever. \"Wakey, wakey, cow tits!\" he proclaims with grotesque glee, his eyes widening as he takes in the intimate tableau. \"Oh, am I interrupting something?\"\n\nElara jerks away from me, pulling the sheet up to cover herself, but not before Snib sees everything. His warty face splits into a wide grin, his yellow teeth gleaming nastily. I scramble to cover my own overexposed body.\n\n\"I knew it!\" Snib's grating voice slithers into the room. \"Two bitches goin' at it, just as I thought! Didn't realize you two were putting on a show.\"\n\n\"You vile little...\" I start, but my words choke off as the collar squeezes a bit, reminding me of my place.\n\nHe turns his warty green head towards me. \"I expect my breakfast soon, Tit-bitch,” he sneers, his eyes glinting with malevolent delight. \"And by breakfast, I mean you hop down to the kitchen, make me sausage and eggs. Good food.\"\n\nElara's grip on the sheet tightens until her knuckles turn white. Her eyes fill with tears, big fat droplets that hang precariously before spilling over.\n\n\"Just get out!\" she cries, her voice breaking.\n\n\"Leave us alone,\" I echo.\n\n\"Last warnin',\" Snib sneers. \"Get your fat arse to the kitchen and make me some food. And make it quick! I’m fucking starvin’!\"\n\nThe sight of Snib, his mere presence, sends waves of nausea through me. \"Get out,\" I repeat, my own voice shuddering, breaking under the strain. But he's already accomplished what he came for, our fragile bubble of intimacy burst by his crude malice.\n\nHe smirks, throwing one final look at me before trudging out the door with a satisfied grunt. Left in the ruins of our early morning tenderness, I collapse beside Elara, wrapping my arms around her trembling form. Tears trail down her cheeks.]Afterwards, I sit up, my nightgown straining futilely against my ample cleavage, the hemline dangerously high, riding up to bare a hint of the curve of my ass. I move my hands to adjust it, feeling the delicate fabric glide over the smooth, shaven skin of my thighs. An obscene tingle sends a shudder down my spine that culminates in an uncomfortable tightness between my legs.\n\nElara gaze drops to my cleavage again. Shock and intrigue war in her eyes, and embarrassment burns my cheeks.\n\nThe nightgown clings to my upper body too tightly, my large, heavy breasts purring at the cool air rushing in. The sensation sends nauseating shivers through me. With an overwhelming feeling of shameful awareness, I attempt to arch my back, hoping to lift the breasts away from the nightgown. But instead, my generous bosom bounces, and the silk clings even more to my nipples.\n\n\"Elise, he's already downstairs. We should get dressed,\" Elara says, her voice strained with concern.\n\n\"Alright,\" I manage to choke out, my voice wavering with emotions I don't want to put a name to.\n\nI stand before the mirror, hot tears welling up as my reflection shows a stranger – a hyper-feminine, curvy mockery of my former self. I let out a choked sob, turning to assess the entirety of this disgusting and yet sickeningly beautiful body. The full breasts hanging like obscene udders, the plump, soft thighs forced to rub together no matter how I stood, and the wide, motherly hips that seem to scream fertility.\n\nSlowly, Elara approaches, holding in her hands a dress – a pale blue day gown from her own wardrobe. She helps me into the undergarments first, holding tight as I step into them, the clumsy steps causing my tits and ass to jiggle embarrassingly. Elara avoids eye contact but doesn’t speak her frustration aloud.\n\nWith every tug and adjustment, I feel my body protest under the delicate fabric of the dress. It's a beautiful piece, modest by design with a high collar and long sleeves. The lenient bodice aims to cover and grant me some semblance of dignity amidst my current form. But the struggle to accommodate my exaggerated curves is palpable. Even as Elara gives her best efforts to make it look presentable on my form, my soft, bountiful breasts strain against the fabric, my hips threatening to burst through the seams. It's a pathetic image, a seductress trapped in a facade of modesty - a far cry from Aldric's former might.\n\n[Choice: Go downstairs...",

My hands tremble as each button comes undone, my breasts heavy and jostling as my trembling increases. The material whispers to the floor, leaving me in nothing but my undergarments, my hands instinctually crossing over my chest, barely containing the weight of my obscenely large tits, every jiggling movement serving as a stark reminder of the maddening curse I'm subjected to.\n\nElara steps protectively in front of me, her back towards Snib, aiming to shield me from those vile yellow eyes. Over her shoulder, she throws a final scathing glare his way, but he merely returns a cocky grin full of appalling glee.\n\n\"Alright slave. C’mon, we ain't got no time for dallying around. Tits out and get that tiny skirt on. Then get yer fat ass downstairs pronto. Got me breakfast to eat.\"\n\nWith a deep breath, I reach for the skimpy bikini top, steeling myself against the sharp pang of distaste plucking at the edge of my senses. The fabric feels so inadequate against the palm of my hand, thin strips of white cloth designed to accentuate, rather than hide, my enlarged breasts. Kneeling down to don it, I can feel the sway of my ample breasts, shifting to adjust with every movement of my body.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n“'Mighty hero.’” Snib drawls out sarcastically, “Quite the sight, ain't it?” His sickly yellow eyes stay fixed on me, seemingly thrilled by his power to see me denigrated from hero to object, constantly reminded of my debasement.\n\n“His name was Aldric, you bastard.” Elara snaps, her words dripped in venom. She stands in the way so the goblin can’t get a look at my exposed body. But Snib just laughs, peeking around her, revelling in his dominance. I can't help but feel a sharp pang as I feel my breasts spill out into the cups of the bra, jiggling as the straps dig into my soft flesh. Each movement echoes through my chest, a quivering sensation that sends heat to my already flushed cheeks.\n\nSwallowing thickly, I reach for the tiny white panties. The thin fabric stretches, pulling tightly against my plush mound as I pull them up my smooth thighs. The second the fabric snaps against my hips, the tangy scent of my own constant arousal wafts openly into the air. Involuntarily, my chest tightens as my face burns brighter. The panties press tightly against my fleshy mound, accentuating the obscene shape of it.\n\nFinally, the dreaded leather skirt. Its edge barely reaches the swell of my ass, which hangs out so lewdly, impossible to hide. I can feel the hem rubbing against my thighs with each movement, making distinct noises as they already begin to chafe against each other. The heavy metal clasp molds itself against my soft waistline, the barely concealed flesh underneath it drawing a thousand lewd images in my mind.\n\n“Mmhm. 'Bout time, tit-bitch. Now get movin’.”\n\n[Choice: Serve him breakfast.",

There’s a certain type of patience in the kitchen that I lack, but Elara seems to understand the language of the shining copper pots and the bubbling concoctions better than anything.\n\nI take a deep breath, drawing in the smell of the food that Elara starts cooking. Garlic and butter fill the air, and despite myself, my belly rumbles. She stirs the ingredients, her delicate, slender wrists whipping up breakfast as though we don’t have an scrawny, green irritation seated at the long oak table.\n\nTurning my attention away from the vixen in the kitchen, I grab the plates and silverware – heavy, bone china that Elara has treasured since we were first married. But as I start arranging them, I stumble.\n\nDamn the curse! Can't he allow even a small amount of peace while Elara is around?\n\n“Snib... please... stop this… Elara…” My pleading whispers die on my lips as my breath hitches, but the goblin behind me gives a throaty chortle.\n\n“Not me problem, tit-bitch, it’s yours!”\n\nI grit my teeth, my fingertips white with the force of my grip on the edge of the table as Snib continues toying with me. The fabric of my snug panties rubs against my aching clit with every slight movement. I swallow the moan that threatens to spill past my lips, heat coiling in my lower belly.\n\n\"Just a little bit longer...\" I try to reassure myself, my breath hitching in my chest.\n\nBut with every prod and squeeze, I'm reminded how much of a joke I've become. The pitiful slave to a goblin, in my own house. Would it be less humiliating to assert my resistance, only to succumb to the directives this collar inflicts on me in punishment?\n\n“You’d better keep it together, Tit-bitch,” Snib snarls in a cruel little whisper, a low and menacing tone. “Or I might just spill all the dirty details of the last few days to your pretty wife.”\n\nMy eyes shoot up to Elara. She’s stoking the fire, her back turned towards us. The light from the flames cast her silhouette against the cobblestone walls, painting her in a radiant glow. Beautiful. Pure. Untouched. Everything I’m not in this moment.\n\n“And we wouldn't want that now, would we?\" Snib's chuckle is like acid in my ears.\n\nAnger flares in me, hot and scorching. Rage that I can’t attack him, can’t defend my wife - her innocence, her happiness - from the threats of the monster who’s gained the control over my life, my body. And with the blessing of the state, no less. I clench my fists, my nails digging into my palms, but the collar around my neck tightens in response, aware of my violent thoughts.",

The scent of my arousal mixes with the room's smells – the roasting meat, simmering herbs and the crisp morning air, my body betraying my feelings of degradation under the vile goblin’s touch.\n\n“Quit yer fussin', sugar tits,” Snib says, and there's something predatory about the glint in his yellow eyes, something wild that sends a shudder crawling up my spine.\n\nHis clawed hand is persistent on my ass, tracing the curve before a gentle pat echoes in the room. I stifle a yelp, the sound coming out as a choked gasp. He plays with me, prolongingly slow just to see me squirm. Each swipe of his hand over the thin fabric of my panties has my toes curling.

It’s been soiled with goblin seed, a sight so revolting it’s almost fascinating.\n\nPuddles of Snib's emissions are scattered across our once-pristine sheets, soaking into the fabric and staining it a sickening milky white.

It's impossible to avoid; Snib's seed is everywhere.\n\nThe musky scent clings to me as I gather up the fabric, trying my best not to let it touch any part of my body. It's no use though – every inhale is filled with the potent smell of goblin cum. It leaves a bitter aftertaste on my tongue that makes me want to gag.\n\n[Choice: You feel something else too...",

Each joyless grapple of his stubby fingers sends piercing jolts right through every nerve in my body.\n\n\"Late night visits, Elise,\" he huffs out intermittently between sloppy licks to my exposed neck. “On’y have to deal with me at night… Y’ slutty little body needs this anyway.” My flesh crawls. His goblin tongue leaves a slimy, filthy trail down my spine.\n\n[Choice: Your hips move back, of their own accord...",

I could never let her go through such an ordeal - must never let her see me like this - I must protect her.\n\nA clothespin – forgotten in this shameful moment - slips from my grasp, landing in the grass below.

Snib's vile words echo around inside my head, the promise of peace dangling like a poisoned carrot.\n\n\"Oooohhh, *fuck~*,\" I whimper.\n\nBut then, a spark of defiance ignites. Aldric’s spirit stirs within me. The realization hits like a slap. This is the start of another dark, endless spiral. A cycle of submission and disgrace, a life defined by yielding to a goblin's whims.\n\n*NO!*\n\nI grit my teeth, hating the feelings that course through me, the way my body responds despite my mind's resistance. This isn’t me. This isn’t my life. I refuse!\n\n\"No!\" The word bursts from me, full of pent-up fury, despair, and resolve. The collar constricts briefly before I feel it, too, loosen within itself. \"I refuse your deal! I won’t give in!\"\n\nSnib snarls, his eyes narrowing, surprised by my outburst. \"Yer gonna regret this,\" he growls, his grip tightening painfully around my hips, claws digging into the soft flesh. He slams his cock against my wet panties one last time. The sharp smack reverberates through my body, leaving me trembling on the edge.\n\nThen, he stalks off, each step laden with dark promises, leaving me standing alone amidst the fluttering laundry.\n\nRelief and fear wash over me in equal measure.\"Fine. I—I'll... come… tonight...\" I manage to squeak out through a clenched jaw, words tasting like poison on my lips. “Just… leave us in peace.”\n\nSnib barks out raucously, patting my firm ass cheek in celebration of his victory.\n\n\"Good... y' finally learnin'. Just remember, you gotta satisfy ol' Snib good an’ proper or this amazing deal is off,\" he warns, yellow eyes gleaming in perverse anticipation.\n\nMy mind races with shame and anxiety. The goblin's words plant a horrible seed in my mind, a plan starts forming. A compromise spurns me on.\n\n\"And it will be a... a handjob,\" I say quickly, trying to lay some boundaries to the debauchery. “And you will… wear protection…” I manage to stammer out this absurd demand not able to meet his leering gaze.\n\nSnib seems amused, a nasty chuckle leaving his throat as he pats my ass one more time. ”Yer can do ‘atever y’ like – tickle me big ol’ green balls too if y’ want,” He exclaims jovially. ”Just make sure Snib’s satisfied.”\n\nMy heart sinks at his vague acceptance, leaving room for his cruel tastes to resurface later... It feels so wrong.\n\nAs he steps away from me, he leaves me with an edge of dread curling up in my belly at the disturbing prospect of satisfying this awful creature.\n\nThe stool creaks under Snib's weight as he hops down from it, and finally gives me space, true to his word.\n\nThe taste of my agreement lingers, bitter and repulsive, as I watch Snib saunter away. His lewd chuckles echo back at me, leaving a sour taste in my mouth. The weight of my words presses down on me, a pact with a goblin - the very creature that has turned my life into a living nightmare.\n\nI straighten out my ridiculous outfit, the wet fabric clinging to my damp skin. The heat between my thighs is undeniable - a shameful reminder of the arousal Snib's touch stirs within me. I suppress a shudder, the lingering touch of his grimy hands on my skin making me feel so dirty.\n\nA few pieces of laundry lie forgotten on the grass, scattered around where Snib had knocked them down during his vile display. I bend over to pick them up, feeling the stretch of my skirt across my ass, the fabric riding up to reveal far more than I'd like.\n\nMy mind races as I finish hanging up the laundry. What have I agreed to? Back to giving him handjobs... I shiver at the thought. His monstrous goblin cock in my hands... I know how things can get so easily out of control with him. But it's better than... other things he could have demanded. The thing I’m worried about the most, is exposing Elara to his pheromones. That would just break my heart.\n\nI’ve made this agreement for Elara. For us. This is the only way to keep her safe from Snib's perverse desires. She doesn't need to know the truth - that her husband now services a goblin for their safety. I'll tell her I'm cleaning his room or something... anything but the truth.\n\nAt least there’s Zephyrion's decree - that Snib would stay at an inn, not in our home. That rule was Mayor Bramble's influence, a small act of kindness in this twisted situation. If it was up to the wizard, he would keep me and Snib in his own little study, locked up together all day while he tinkered.\n\nAs I finish with the laundry and step back into our once peaceful home, I can't help but feel a sense of dread creeping up on me. Tonight... Tonight will be the start of something horrid. But if it keeps Elara safe... If it gives us some semblance of peace during the day...\n\nI'll endure it.\n\n[Choice: Later...",

Zephyrion is beside me, a collection of strange, arcane tools spread across the table.\n\nIt’s the first of our daily sessions, where the wizard is going to try and tap into the eldritch connection in my collar.\n\nSnib lounges in a corner of the room, his yellow eyes watching us with an unsettling intensity. His presence feels like a stain on the room, a reminder of my ongoing torment. But the wizard emphasized the importance of his presence.\n\nZephyrion picks up a delicate tool - a slender rod ending in a tiny crystal orb. He brings it close to the collar, his stormy grey eyes squinting as he studies the reaction. The crystal flickers with an ethereal light, but something seems off.\n\n\"Hmm,\" he mutters under his breath, setting the tool down and picking up another. \"No magical energy in the traditional sense. I may need to order some additional tools for a thorough examination.\"\n\nHis words hang in the air like an unfinished melody. I feel a shiver of unease crawl down my spine as he continues his examination.\n\nAfter what feels like an eternity, Zephyrion sets aside his rod and turns to me. \"Elise,\" he says, \"I’ll need a drop of your blood.\"\n\nThe request sends a jolt through my body. I look at him, my heart pounding in my chest. He holds my gaze, waiting for my response.\n\n[Choice: Why?",

The needle pricks my skin and I wince as a droplet of blood wells up.\n\nZephyrion collects it on a small glass slide and brings it under a lens mounted on an intricate brass stand. His brow furrows as he peers through the lens, studying the drop of blood.\n\n\"There are… slight differences to human blood,\" he murmurs after a while, straightening up and turning to me. “Not as major as I was expecting. Your body is almost completely human, or at least a convincing simulacrum.”\n\nHe looks frustrated now, his fingers drumming on the table as he contemplates his next move.\n\n\"Snib,\" Zephyrion says, his voice echoing in the quiet room, \"Constrict the collar.\"\n\nSnib grunts in response, \"It ain't up to me, wizard. The collar does what it wants.\"\n\nZephyrion turns to me, his stormy eyes contemplative. \"Elise,\" he says, \"Do something to trigger the collar.\"\n\n\"No!\" Elara's voice cuts through the room like a knife. She stands from her chair, her sapphire eyes blazing with fury. Zephyrion simply gazes at her, waiting for her to calm down.\n\nI swallow hard, my heart pounding against my ribcage. I know there’s no way to get out of this without complying. I turn to Snib, meeting his yellow gaze.\n\n*Might as well enjoy this.*\n\n[Choice: Insult Snib!",

I gasp for breath, clawing at the metal band around my neck.\n\n\"Stop!\" Elara screams, but Zephyrion remains focused on the collar.\n\nHe nods at Snib, signaling him to release me. But Snib shakes his head. \"She has to do it,\" he says with a wicked grin.\n\nTears stream down my face as I choke out the words: \"Master... I'm sorry for insulting you.\"\n\nThe collar relaxes instantly and I fall forward gasping for breath. My massive breasts heave with each deep intake of air, jiggling obscenely under the skimpy bikini top.\n\nZephyrion studies the collar intently, his brow furrowed. He makes observations about it aloud as he scribbles notes on a piece of parchment.\n\n\"The link seems to strengthen when a command is made by the goblin,\" he murmurs before looking up at me. \"And it appears to have connections to your mind as well... It's not just auditory... it's telepathic.\"\n\nHis words hang heavy in the air as he continues his examination. The collar is an ancient relic from a long-lost civilization - a civilization that was far more advanced than we are now.\n\n\"Once again, I apologize for the discomfort,\" Zephyrion says, his voice almost apologetic. But there's a coldness there, a detachment that makes it clear he's more interested in results than my well-being. \"It is necessary for the security of the kingdom.\"\n\nHe picks up the glass slide with my blood sample, tucking it carefully into a small case. He stands, his indigo robes falling around him in a cascade of fabric.\n\n\"I'll return tomorrow for more tests,\" he says, his stormy eyes meeting mine. \"Rest well, Elise.\"\n\n[Choice: He leaves.",

His thin lips curl into a sneer as he crosses the room towards the couch.\n\nSnib throws himself onto the couch, lounging like some little king upon his throne.\n\n\"Ya and I are gonna have a little chat, slut,\" he says, patting his lap with a cruel, expectant grin. \"You hurt ol’ Snib's feelings with those mean words. And now it's time for a proper punishment. Git over here.\"\n\n\"No,\" I manage to choke out, shaking my head as I recoil. Bitter memories and shadows of past humiliations flit across my mind. The collar tightens. \"I- I won't. I did what the wizard said--\"\n\n\"Wrong answer, cow tits!\" he snarls.\n\nI feel the collar constricting around my throat. Air becomes a luxury.\n\nElara rushes forward, her blue eyes wide and wild. \"Stop this! Let her go! You monster!\"\n\nBut Snib's yellow eyes glitter dangerously as he turns his gaze to her. \"You best be quiet, pretty,\" he growls. \"Less you wanna join ‘er.\"\n\nChoked gasps escape my lips as I desperately fight against the collar’s grip, the world narrowing to a pinpoint. Finally, gasping and trembling, I relent.\n\nWith shaky limbs, I crawl onto the couch, shuffling begrudgingly over Snib’s lap. My massive breasts squish against his bony knees, and the degrading weight of them pulls me down, making me whimper uncontrollably. The leather skirt rides up, and he’s quick to jerk it higher until my full, round ass is completely exposed to him. The vulnerable cheeks quiver with the movement, bare beneath the pitiful curtains of my miniskirt.\n\nSnib chuckles darkly, giving my bare ass a condescending squeeze. \"That's a good cow,\" he coos, tracing a clawed finger along the curve of my ass. “Look at this weak, jiggly slut ass, just perfect for me to teach ya who’s da boss now.”\n\nMy face burns with shame as I bury it against the cushion, each cruel word landing like a slap. His clawed hand comes down hard on the sensitive flesh of my ass, and my entire body jerks with the impact.)\n\n\"AHHH! UNNNNGH!\" I cry out, pain and humiliation mingling in my voice as the force reverberates through my body, feeling the sting of his cruel handprint imprinted on my aching cheek.\n\n\"No, please, Snib!\" Elara shouts, her voice high and frantic, tears streaking down her face. She drops to her knees, trembling hands clasped together in supplication. \"Please, stop! She was just following orders! You can’t do this to her!\"\n\nSnib mocks her pleas. \"Oh, y'think I won't? This bitch needs to be reminded of her place.\" He strokes the flesh of my ass again, savoring the heat radiating from the previous impact. \"And since she hurt my feelings,\" he continues, his voice dripping with malicious joy, \"It's time for a good ol' fashioned SPANKIN'. Because you've been a real naughty girl, Elise.\"\n\nAnother sharp crack echoes through the room, landing on my tender, stinging cheek.\n\n\"AHNN... Nooo!\" I sob, my voice breaking under the weight of my tears.\n\nSnib's hand comes down harshly again, every spank punctuated by his depraved satisfaction. \"That's for hurting yer Master's feelings!\" he snarls, each word chased by the sickening slap of his palm against my flesh. \"Ya think ya can disrespect me? I'll show ya, ya fat-assed whore, yer place!\"\n\n\"Please, no, she didn't mean to! She was just doing what the wizard said!” Elara’s voice is desperate, each word laced with the ring of desperation. She’s on her knees, her horrified eyes locked on the degrading scene, the sight of her feminized husband being ridiculed and punished by a vile, lowly creature.\n\n[Choice: He keeps going!]Elara watches him go, her sapphire eyes filled with a mixture of relief and worry. She's quiet as the door closes behind them, leaving us alone with Snib.\n\nThe goblin grunts, pushing himself up from his corner. He stretches, his pudgy belly protruding from above his loincloth.\n\n\"Right, I'll be off then ta the Silver Stag,\" he says, his voice gruff but oddly polite. He turns to Elara, his yellow eyes softening slightly. \"Thanks for the grub, missus. Apologies for me goblin ways.\"\n\nHe gives me a wink as he heads towards the door, a lewd grin spreading across his face. \"And thanks in advance for tidying up my room later, Elise. It's gotten a wee bit messy.\"\n\nOnce the door closes behind him, Elara rushes to my side, her slender fingers gently applying a soothing ointment to my bruised neck.\n\n\"He seemed... less crude this afternoon,\" she murmurs, her sapphire eyes studying my face for any signs of distress.\n\nI nod slowly, the cool ointment providing some relief to my aching neck. \"We had a talk,\" I admit, avoiding her gaze. \"I agreed to keep his room tidy if he'd behave.\"\n\nElara's eyes widen in surprise. \"Elise,\" she says, her voice filled with concern. \"You shouldn't have to do that. They have housekeeping.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I reply quietly. \"But apparently they didn’t want anything to do with a goblin. This is the only way to keep him in check.\"\n\nShe looks at me for a long moment, her blue eyes filled with worry and suspicion. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" she asks. “I want you back soon.”\n\n[Choice: Shake your head.]",

Thop him!\" I cry out pathetically, but my pleas are smothered by Snib's relentless assault. His hand is a blur, each spank molding and remolding the tender flesh of my ass, imprinting his humiliation deeper into my soul.\n\nMy mind is swirling with panic, horror. Elara's face is a twisted mask of anguish, her sobs a heart-wrenching melody that slices through me. She's begging Snib to stop, her pleas falling on deaf ears.\n\nSnib's sinister grin splits his face, all too pleased with the chaos he's creating. \"Why are ya defendin' ‘er, sweetie?\" he taunts, his voice a grating mockery. \"Yer Hubby 'ere ain't told you everythin', now has he?\"\n\n\"What... what are you talking about?\" Elara's voice is shattered, her eyes wide.\n\nSnib's grip tightens, his spanking growing harsher, leaving raw, stinging welts on my ass. \"Elise, wanna tell your pretty wife about what ya did with me in that stall at the Silver Stag?\"\n\nMy breath hitches, my eyes wild with terror.

Her eyes, filled with disbelief and raw agony, reflect the breaking of her heart. It’s the worst thing I've ever seen.\n\n\"Tell ‘er!” Snib's voice is a snarl, a brutal command punctuated by the relentless spanking. \"Tell her what you did in the Silver Stag latrine! Tell ’er, you filthy slut!”\n\n\"I'm-thorry... I'm-thorry! I-I-...\" I wail, the words tearing themselves from me as the storm of his spanks beat against my resolve. \"I gave him a handjob in the latrine, Elara!

Why...?\"\n\n\"I had no choith! I...

She knew how to handle a cock by then. She loved milkin' my cum straight from the tap. And when she was done, she’d dance for me, arse naked, shaking that greedy whore ass for me, beggin' me to paint it with gobbo jizz.”\n\n“NO! HE’S LYING!” I scream desperately, my voice cracking with desperation, but the collar around my neck tightens like a vice before I can continue.\n\n“Lying?” Snib’s voice is a poisonous whisper in my ear. “Yer gonna regret that.”\n\nHis hand descends again, the brutal slap echoing in the room, drawing a fresh wave of tears from me. I scream again, but my cries are muffled by the couch, my body burning with pain and humiliation.\n\n“And would you like to know the best part, pretty wife?” Snib sneers, his eyes gleaming as he looks at Elara. “Yer precious hubby wud jill off every night in the straw, like an animal!

I had no choice!” I sob, my voice breaking. “I—”\n\n\"Actually, be quiet!\" she snaps, her voice cold as steel. I've never heard her speak like this. The look in her eyes is a dagger that guts me without mercy.\n\nShe turns to Snib, her lip quivering with a mixture of revulsion and resolve. “Snib,” she says softly, “stop.”\n\nThe goblin's hand halts, hovering over my raw, throbbing ass. A sinister grin spreads across his face as he looks at my wife.\n\nElara’s shoulders tremble, her blue eyes blazing as she stares down at me.\n\n\"I *trusted* you, Aldric!\" her voice breaks. “I trusted you and you... you betrayed that trust! You lied to me, you hid things from me… and... you... you let him...”\n\nShe struggles to find the words, her eyes darting to Snib, whose hand still rests on my sore, reddened ass.\n\nSnib's grin widens, reveling in the chaos he’s caused. “Yeah, yer precious Aldric wasn’t so tough after all, was he?” he taunts, giving another playful smack to my jiggling ass.\n\n“Snib, please…” Elara whispers softly. “Just… just stop.”\n\nSnib’s eyes glint. “What ya got in mind, sweetie pie?” His gaze sweeps over her body with a lecherous appreciation.\n\nShe takes a deep, shuddering breath, her expression darkening. “If I… um... finish you off,” she says through clenched teeth, each word dripping with venom and bitterness, “will you give me the same deal? Leave me alone for a week? I can't deal with any more of this.”\n\nMy eyes widen in shock, my heart seizing painfully in my chest. “No, Elara! Don’t…” I begin, my voice a hoarse whisper.\n\nShe turns to me. “Shut up, Elise,” she snaps, her voice harsh. “You’ve done enough. Look at this mess you’ve made.”\n\n“Elara, please…” I beg, my heart breaking at the sight of the woman I love, reduced to this desperate act. “You don’t have to do this…”\n\nShe glares at me, her eyes shining with tears. “Because that’s different, right? It’s different when I do it?” she demands, her voice shaking. “But you can do whatever you want? I thought we were in this together! And you hid all this from me!”\n\nI shake my head, tears streaming down my face. “Elara, it’s not… it’s not… I…”\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, it’s always different when it’s someone else,\" Snib sneers, his voice dripping with mockery. “But fine, I accept yer offer, wifey.”\n\nElara’s eyes bore into mine. “If it’s so understandable, then what will you say if I do it? Tell me, Elise, what then?”\n\n“N... NO!” I squeal, my heart throbbing.\n\nThe room falls into an agonizing silence, punctuated only by my sobs and Elara’s ragged breathing. Snib’s grin is wide, his yellowed teeth gleaming hideously in the dim light.\n\n“Have it your way,” Elara hisses, turning to Snib. “Then you'll give us one week of peace?”\n\n“Oh, absolutely,” Snib croons, his eyes dancing with sadistic glee. “If ya finish me off, I won’t even come ‘round yer house unless the wizard asks. Or ya INVITE me!”\n\nI can’t believe what I’m hearing. My heart feels like it's being wrenched from my chest. “Elara, don’t…” I sob, my voice cracking under the weight of my despair.\n\nElara doesn't look at me. She steps closer to Snib, her hands shaking but resolute. She turns back to me, her eyes cold and furious. “You said it was unavoidable,” she says, her voice barely above a whisper. “So now, watch *me* do what you did. And see how *you* feel about it.”\n\n“Elara, no… please, you don’t need to do this—\"\n\n“It’s different, though, isn’t it?\" Elara's voice is hard and unrelenting. “When it’s you, it’s understandable, but when it’s me, it’s outrageous, right?”\n\n[Choice: Snib pushes you off the couch.]My heart pounds in my chest as I approach the Silver Stag, the bag of condoms heavy in my hand. The gnome shopkeeper's lewd wink still burns in my memory, his knowing grin as he handed me the bag.\n\nThe outfit I’m wearing is absolutely harrowing, to have to walk through town in. The white bikini top is barely more than two small triangles of fabric, held together by thin strings that dig into the soft flesh of my shoulders and back. It barely contains my massive breasts, the fabric stretching tightly over the swell of my flesh. The short leather skirt is a mockery of modesty, barely covering anything at all. The white panties underneath make things worse, hugging my hips and disappearing between the round globes of my ass.\n\nAs I step into the Silver Stag, I can feel every eye in the place on me. A group of mercenaries at a nearby table stop their conversation to stare, their eyes raking over my body with undisguised lust. Outsiders.\n\n\"Well, well,\" one of them drawls, his eyes fixed on my chest. \"Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?\"\n\n\"Come have a drink with us, love,\" another one calls out, patting the empty seat next to him.\n\nI blush furiously, trying to ignore them as I make my way to the bar. But their comments follow me, each one more obscene than the last.\n\n\"Why don't you pour some ale down those tits of yours and let us drink it off?\" one suggests, his companions laughing uproariously.\n\n\"Going around dressed like that,\" another adds lewdly. \"You're just asking for trouble. Didn’t know Eboncrest had whores like that!\"\n\n\"I've got a mind to give her some trouble,\" a third chimes in, his eyes gleaming with anticipation.",

I tumble onto the floor, the heavy, obscene weight of my tits swinging wildly.\n\nMy heart pounds erratically, tears streaming down my cheeks as I scramble to get up.\n\n\"Elara, please!\" I sob, but she doesn't look at me.\n\nSnib’s sneering voice cuts through my pleas. \"Shut up, cow tits. This is between me and yer wifey.\"\n\nHis words are acid, burning through the raw wound of this fucked-up scene. He leans back, lounging on the couch with a smug grin, his loincloth straining. He tilts his hips forward, showcasing the grotesque outline of his cock pressed against the leather.\n\nElara takes a deep, shaky breath, her hands trembling as she steps forward. \"I can't believe I'm doing this,\" she whispers, her voice thick with revulsion and disbelief. Her eyes widen as she takes in the sight before her, and she drops to her knees, positioned between Snib's outspread legs. \"But you leave me no choice, 'Elise.'\"\n\n\"No, please, Elara—\" I try to choke out, my voice a desperate plea.\n\n\"Be quiet now and watch!\" Elara’s voice is sharp, cutting through my heart like a jagged blade. Her tears glisten on her cheeks. Snib's eyes dance with malicious glee as he turns to me.\n\n\"Ye heard yer wife,\" he sneers. “Gettin’ all indignant now, eh? She ain't doin' anything ye haven't done.\"\n\nI cringe, my breath hitching. Seeing my silence, the goblin’s grin widens. He shifts, making himself more comfortable as his loincloth stretches comically against his bulging erection.\n\nElara’s eyes are wide as she reaches out tentatively towards Snib. She pauses, her fingers trembling as they brush against his thigh. Her distaste is evident, her body shuddering with disgust. She looks up at him with a mix of horror and resignation.\n\n“Take yer time, sweetheart,” Snib purrs. “Go on, let’s see them pretty hands on a real man’s cock. Show us how good wifey can be.”\n\nHe stretches out luxuriously, his torso arching as he moves. His hardened cock strains under the fabric, gleaming pre-cum already soaking through. Elara starts to reach out, but then her hands drop, and she shudders, opting to sit down on the couch beside him instead, squirming away from his close proximity.\n\nSnib chuckles, seemingly relishing the moment. \"C'mon now, don't be shy. Can take it any way ye want it.”\n\nWith a look of pure disgust, she reaches for his loincloth with shaky hands and pulls it aside. What springs forth stretches the bounds of biology — twelve inches of a monstrous, thick green goblin cock standing proud, its surface rippling with bulging veins. As it thuds heavily against Snib's thigh, a thick bead of nasty, oozing precum drizzles from the tip, forming a slick trail along its length.\n\nElara gasps at the sight, her eyes widening in horrified fascination. “It’s too... big...”\n\nHer voice shakes with disbelief, and distaste practically emanates from her in waves as her fingers hover nervously over the repulsive length. She looks away, biting her lip, a soft whimper escaping her.\n\nI can't watch this any longer. “Elara, n—” I try to warn her about the pheromones, but Snib's meaningfully malevolent gaze snaps to mine, and the collar constricts, cutting off my voice entirely.\n\nHelplessly, I’m forced to watch in silence, horror twisting in my gut. Elara’s grip is tentative, her hands delicate and shaking as they curl around Snib’s obscene cock. Her touch is hesitant, horrified, but she steels herself, forcing herself to continue. She begins to move her hands up and down the massive schlong.\n\nSnib's eyes flutter closed as he groans in pleasure, his smirk widening. “That’s it, just like that. Look at ya, wifey. Got some real potential...\"\n\nWith each drip of precum, the scent intensifies – an overpowering musk that clings to the air, filling it with a heady, nauseating tang. Elara’s eyes glisten with unshed tears as they dart away from the sight of the grotesque, flexing goblin cock squirting its vile essence into her grasp.\n\nFor a moment, she hesitates.\n\n\"No turning back now, sweetie. Pump that fat gobbo cock,\" Snib encourages, his voice a sickly purr. \"Imagine how many times yer hubby here did exactly this. Oh, she's right good at it, musta learned from me.\"\n\n[Choice: Your wife continues to jerk him off...]I'm about to respond when a figure steps up to their table. It's Roderick, a grizzled veteran who's been a friend of Aldric's for years. He glares at the men, his fists clenched at his sides.\n\n\"Leave her alone,\" he growls, his voice low and dangerous.\n\nThe men look at him in surprise, then start to laugh. But their laughter dies quickly when Roderick punches the biggest one in the face, sending him sprawling backwards.\n\n\"Next time you bother her,\" Roderick says coldly, \"you'll have me to deal with.\"\n\nHe turns to me then, giving me a small salute. He, and the other town guards, must have been briefed about my situation. I blush even deeper but manage to give him a grateful nod before turning back to the bar. At least someone here still cares about who I used to be.\n\nSlightly emboldened by that, I stride towards the innkeeper. He's a burly man with a bushy beard, his eyes widening as he takes in my outfit. He’s been briefed by Zephyrion - he knows I’m Aldric.\n\n\"I'm here to… clean Snib's—\"\n\nI choke on the word as my collar suddenly constricts, cutting off my breath. My hand instinctively flies to my throat, attempting to loosen its grip.\n\nThe innkeeper looks at me quizzically, his eyes flicking to the collar around my neck. \"You’re here to clean the goblin’s room?\"\n\nI nod, my face burning with humiliation. \"Yes,\" I croak, struggling to get the words out. \"Which one is… my master's room?\"\n\nThe innkeeper looks at me with a mixture of disdain and pity. \"That thing really did a number on you, didn't it, Aldric?\" he remarks, shaking his head. \"The little green monster is in room six. This means I can cancel housekeeping - thank the gods.\"\n\nAs I make my way towards the stairs, the innkeeper calls out after me, eyeing my skimpy attire up and down. \"Does your wife know you're here?\"\n\nI pause for a moment before answering, my stomach clenching with guilt. \"Yes,\" I say quietly. \"She knows I'm cleaning his room.\"\n\nThe innkeeper says nothing more as I continue up the stairs. Each step is a struggle, my body heavy with dread and anticipation. The hallway is dimly lit, the flickering light from a single candle casting long shadows on the wooden floor.\n\nI can feel a dampness between my legs and clench them together in an attempt to quell the humiliating arousal that courses through me.\n\nRoom six... I stop in front of a plain wooden door, taking a deep breath before knocking softly.\n\n\"Come in,\" Snib's gruff voice calls out from inside.\n\n[Choice: Enter...]",

Tight grip, too.”\n\nElara’s face twists with disgust, but she doesn’t stop. The rank smell of goblin precum and smegma fills the room, the acrid stench like a repugnant fog. Each stroke of her hands draws a fresh nauseating swirl, the thick goo spreading under her touch and oozing into her trembling palm. The sight of her delicate fingers tainted, working that grotesque length, twists my stomach.\n\nThe squelching noises as she strokes fill the room, a constant grim reminder of the lewd debasement happening right before me. Her movements are hesitant, filled with distaste, each moment tearing a little bit more of my heart apart.\n\nSeeing her beautiful face – once the picture of love and trust – now a mask of horrified disbelief, her sapphire eyes shining with unfallen tears, is more than I can bear. She glances at me, a fleeting look of hurt and betrayal, then quickly averts her gaze back to the monstrous task at hand.\n\nThe disgusting length flexes under Elara’s grasp, throbbing with each movement of her hands. A fresh spurt of thick, yellowish precum leaks from the tip, and she tries to shake it off when it touches her fingers.\n\n“Come on, use both hands, sweetheart,” Snib instructs, his voice a low, insidious purr. “Gotta work that cock properly if ye want me to give ya that week of peace, eh?”\n\nElara hesitates, her eyes darting to me, pleading silently for reassurance. I can see her resolve wavering, the reality of what she’s doing crashing down on her. She takes a shuddering breath, her cheeks flushing deeply as she slowly wraps her other hand around Snib’s monstrous cock, now using both hands to pump him up and down.\n\n“There ya go,” Snib encourages, his voice dripping with satisfaction. “Look at ya, workin’ that fat gobbo schlong like a proper whore. Elise could learn a thing or two from ya. She had a pretty good rhythm, but yer hands... they’re somethin’ else. Housewife hands.”\n\nMy heart aches as I watch her, my mind flooded with memories of our life together. The way she laughed on our wedding day, the warmth of her embrace, the way she kissed me goodnight.\n\nElara, my beautiful wife, jerking off a goblin.\n\nI couldn’t have warned her about the pheromones in Snib’s seed. But the fear gnaws at me, knowing what they did to me. Knowing what it could do to her.\n\nSnib's cock bulges and throbs obscenely in Elara’s grasp. The grotesque appendage flexes and twitches, the fleshy, veiny surface glistening with the mix of smegma and precum. Each stroke of her hands is punctuated by lewd, squelching sounds as her fingers glide over the slick surface.\n\n“Maybe if ye show yer tits,” Snib says, his voice a mocking croon, “It’ll make me nut faster. C’mon, let’s see those perky little things, eh?”\n\nElara gasps, her cheeks flushing a deep red as she shakes her head, not willing to take that step. The humiliation radiates from her in waves, her eyes wide and pleading. “No, I can’t...”\n\nSnib’s grin widens, relishing her reluctance. “Oh, shy now, are we? Hah! Just keep pumpin’ then, if you want to drag this out.”\n\nElara’s hands continue their torturous rhythm, her face contorted in a mixture of disgust and determination. She pumps Snib’s cock with a steady grip, her movements mechanical, each up-and-down motion bringing fresh waves of repulsion to her beautiful face.\n\nMy heart shatters as I’m forced to watch, transfixed by the sight. Every fiber of my being wants to intervene, to rip Snib away from her, but I’m paralyzed, bound by my own fear and the constricting grip of the collar. My wife, my Elara, reduced to this...\n\nBecause of me.\n\n“Just think, this is all yer husband’s fault,” Snib taunts, his voice dripping with malicious glee. “If she’d just been a proper little whore, you wouldn’t have to do this. She got ‘erself into this mess. Maybe she didn’t please me enough.”\n\nElara’s eyes glisten with tears, her hands shaking even more as she fights to maintain her grip on the monstrous cock. “I... I can’t believe you did this so many times, Elise,” she whispers, her voice breaking. “Why... why didn’t you tell me? Why did you let this happen?”\n\n“I’m sorry,” I sob, my voice a broken whisper. “I’m so, so sorry, Elara. I didn’t want to...”\n\n“Save yer breath, Tit-bitch,” Snib interjects, his voice cutting through my apology. “Ya wanna apologize? Then keep quiet and watch how a real woman takes care o’ business.”\n\n[Choice: The nightmare continues...]I push open the door and step inside. The room is small and cramped, filthy, with a single bed against one wall and a small table on the other. Snib is lounging on the bed, the white sheets stained already with the dirt of his body, his dick already out.\n\n\"Elise,\" he grins wickedly, patting the spot next to him on the bed. \"Ready to clean up?\"\n\nI swallow hard, clutching the bag tightly in my hand as I walk towards him.\n\n\"Yes,\" I say quietly. \"I'm ready.\"\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n[Choice: You're going to make this quick.]",

Faster now. *Milk* me just like your precious hero hubby Elise did!\"\n\nHe leans back against the couch, his disgusting smirk wide as he relishes the control he holds over the scene. His eyes, filled with malicious excitement, trail over Elara's strained, trembling form.\n\n\"C’mon, wifey, put some elbow into it! Ain’t you wanna make me nut?\"\n\nElara's fingers tighten, the thick goo of pre-cum making her strokes more slippery, more obscene. With a disgusted grimace, she spits onto Snib’s erection, the saliva mingling with the sticky precum to create a slick, revolting mixture that makes her hands glide even more luridly along the throbbing girth.\n\n\"Fuck yeah,\" Snib grunts, his hips bucking into her hands, driving his massive length through the ring of her fingers. “Spit on it more! Lube it up good!”\n\nThe sight is horrifying — my Elara, her beautiful face twisted in revulsion as she obediently follows every nasty prompt, her hands a blur on Snib’s glistening, pulsing cock.\n\nI feel a surge of desperation as I realize how close she is to sinking into the fog that I know all too well. The same fog that made me feel detached from my own actions and choices, leaving me adrift in a sea of arousal and compliance.\n\nSnib's grunting grows more animalistic. \"Yeah, just like that, keep goin’! Show me how much you want it. Show me how good you can be for your goblin master!\"\n\nMy breath catches in my throat. This can't be happening. Not to Elara. I have to do something, anything. My eyes dart around the room desperately, searching for anything that might stop this nightmare.\n\nThere! A clay flowerpot, sitting unobtrusively on the windowsill, half-filled with soil. I stagger toward it, each movement fraught with desperation. The collar tightens slightly as if warning me, but it doesn’t stop me. I grasp it, my fingers cold and trembling, hoping it might catch—\n\nSnib smirks, noticing the changes coming over my wife as she inhales more of his scent. \"Ye starting to like it, huh? Bet ye never thought you’d get off on goblin cock. Say it! Say you love my fat gobbo dick!\"\n\nElara whimpers, her voice barely audible, her lips trembling as she repeats the humiliating phrase, \"I... I love your goblin... your goblin cock.\"\n\n\"That’s it, that’s my good wifey,\" Snib crows with delight. \"Now, spit on it. Make it nice and wet.\"\n\nElara leans forward and spits on Snib’s pulsating cock, her saliva mingling with the slimy pre-cum, her hand churning the vile mixture on his throbbing length. The sound of her sob mixes with the squelching noises of her hand pumping up and down his slick, disgusting shaft.\n\n\"Yeah, work that shaft, you filthy slut. You ain't never going back to being a prim and proper wife after this. Gonna think of this fat gobbo cock every time ye touch yourself.\"\n\nMy heart twists in agony, seeing the defeat in her eyes as she succumbs to his crude dominance. Inside, I’m screaming, desperate to stop this, to protect her from this foul creature's corruption. But the heavy collar around my neck is a constant reminder of my own helplessness.\n\nI stagger back to Elara, desperate to intercept the monstrous load with the pot. But as I reach her side, Snib barks out a laugh, his cock throbbing violently in her hands.\n\n[Choice: Try to catch the load in the flowerpot!",

Ain't no going back to being a prude wife after this.\"\n\nHis words land like blows, each one a painful sear to my heart. As he continues to degrade Elara, I stumble forward, the flowerpot gripped tightly in my hands. But with a violent swipe, Snib sends the pot flying, and it shatters against the stone floor.\n\n\"Hands off, Elise!\" he barks, grinning maliciously. \"Yer gonna sit and watch your pretty wife become a proper gobbo slut.\"\n\nThe collar constricts around my neck, forcing me to halt. Elara whimpers as Snib forces her back onto the couch, his heavy cock looming over her beautiful face. My eyes widen with horror as I realize what's about to occur.\n\n\"You've been a real good wifey,\" Snib jeers, beginning to jerk himself off over Elara's terrified face. \"Think it's about time you got a nice, big face-full of gobbo cream.\"\n\n\"Elise... Elise, help!\" Elara pleads, her terrified eyes meeting mine. But the collar tightens warningly, silencing my desperate cries.\n\nSnib grunts, his grotesque features contorting in ecstasy as he strokes himself faster, his hand a blur on his massive goblin cock. His eyes are heavy with sadistic pleasure, the perverse joy he takes in our pain palpable.\n\nHe’s close. The nauseating thunk of his heavy balls slapping against his grotesque length, the twitching of his shaft in Elara’s trembling grasp... it’s the same sight I’ve had to endure too many times.\n\n\"I'm going to feed you so much gobbo seed, you'll taste me in your dreams,\" Snib growls.\n\nWith a savage grunt, he aligns the sordid slit of his cockhead with Elara's nostril.\n\nThen, with a grunt of satiated pleasure, it happens.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nThe first *jet* launches direct and purposeful. It's a thick spurt that squirts right up her nostril. The hot goblin seed shoots up, invading her sinus, a direct line to her brain. Elara gags, her body shaking, as she instinctively tries to turn away, but Snib’s hand clamps on her jaw, holding her steady.\n\n\"Jus' enjoy it,\" he hisses, his voice thick with triumph. His free hand maneuvers her face, positioning her like a doll for his pleasure.\n\nThe next *gush* of his vile climax aims directly at her mouth. Snib’s cock spills open her lips, the thick, chunky goo pulsing down her throat. It's a forced feeding, a goblin claiming victory in the most intimate, suffocating way possible. Elara's eyes water, her cheeks ballooning slightly as she struggles to swallow the repulsive load.\n\nSnib barks out a laugh, his pleasure peaking as he watches her choke down his seed. \"That’s it, drink it down like the good little wife you are.\"\n\nThen his aim shifts slightly, decorating her face. One egregious stream after another splatters across her skin—a humiliating pattern of his ownership. Each *thick, gooey strand* drapes over her cheeks, dribbles down her chin, and strings disgustingly from her eyebrows. It's a web of goblin filth, marking her indelibly.\n\nAnother vile ribbon catches in her lashes, clumping them together in a grotesque parody of makeup. He coats her in his filth, each spurt a brand that she’ll wear long after he’s finished.\n\n\"Look at her,\" Snib crows to me, triumphant and cruel. \"Covered in goblin jizz. She’ll never be the same again. Gobbo sperm changes a person... ye know that, right Elise?\"\n\nElara’s once beautiful visage is now streaked and slicked with the nasty, yellow-tinged goblin cum. Her dignity, her essence, seems seeped away with each pulse of Snib's disgusting climax. The last blasts stain her neck and the collar of her blouse, the fabric absorbing his dominance, ruining it as thoroughly as he has ravaged her spirit.\n\nAnd there, amidst the ruin, she slumps—a masterpiece defiled, a wife demeaned beneath a layer of thick, sticky humiliation. Her breathing is ragged, her mind possibly teetering on the edge of that dark well of despair into which I’ve peered too many times.\n\nOh, Elara, my heart mourns, my soul screams in silence—what have I allowed to happen to you?

Her eyes, once bright with intelligence and warmth, now roll up, glazed and vacant under the thick haze of goblin pheromones.\n\nThe sound of his enormous, grotesque balls *smack* against her with each heavy thrust, the filthy squelch of his cock plowing her drenched pussy fills the room, drawing a lurid symphony of primal, debased desire. Snib grunts and growls like the beast he is, his coarse, filthy dialogue painting the air with obscenities.\n\nSnib, gripping a fistful of Elara's braid, yanks her head back, causing her to arch her back even more, presenting herself obscenely to his thrusts. \"That's it, me pretty slut! Tell me how much ya love this goblin dick!\"\n\n\"*Unnghhh*...I love it! I love your fat cock, Master Snib,\" Elara whimpers, her words slurring into a moan as Snib delivers a sharp spank to her perfectly rounded ass, leaving a vivid red imprint on her pale skin.\n\nThe bed creaks under their violent rutting, the legs scraping against the wooden floor with each savage thrust. The room is a cacophony of their carnal noises—the *clapping* of flesh on flesh, her whimpering moans, his grunting sneers. It's a relentless assault on the senses, a tableau of betrayal and degradation laid bare before my eyes.\n\nElara's once neat and tidy hair is a wild tangle, her freckles stand out stark against her flushed face, which contorts with the blend of pain and pleasure.\n\n\"Don't stop, don't fucking stop! Fill me up, stuff me full of your seed, *please*!\" Elara begs, her voice desperate, her eyes rolling back, pupils dilated—lost completely in the fog of goblin pheromones.\n\n\"That's a good bitch!\" Snib cackles, reveling in his control over her, enjoying every moment of my torment as well. \"Ya didn't need that hero hubby of yers, eh? I'm your king now!\"\n\nI stand there, trembling, my own body betraying me with a cocktail of horror, disgust, and a despairingly familiar arousal as I watch my wife debase herself under the thrusts of this vile creature. The metal collar tightens around my neck as my emotions swirl dangerously high. I’m shaking, caught between the incendiary rage to rip Snib away from her and the crushing realization of my own powerlessness.\n\nElara's gaze meets mine, glassy and distant, yet filled with a lust-driven madness. \"Join us, Elise,\" she pants, her voice husky. \"This is the only way we can be together now. Come feel what a real cock feels like.\"\n\nMy soul crumples at the invitation, the humiliation complete.\n\nTears sting my eyes.\n\nAs Snib reaches his climax, his body tenses, and he pulls Elara's hair harder, tilting her head back. \"Here comes your gobbo cream, whore!\" he growls, and with a final, brutal thrust, he spills himself inside her. The thick ropes of his cum shoot deep, marking her internally as his property.\n\nElara cries out, a sound of twisted satisfaction escaping her lips as she feels him fill her up.\n\nThe sight is too much. Nausea roils in my stomach, and the room spins as the full weight of our shattered lives crashes down upon me.\n\nSnib, still embedded within Elara, turns his head to smirk at me. \"Well, Elise? Gonna join the party, or are you just gonna stand there and cry?\"\n\n(:\"14 hips\",14,\"Snib turned your wife into his cum dumpster!\")",

Tat’s right. I wanted ta make it a s-special place for me lil’ slut ta serve me,\" His rough voice grates on my ears, sending shivers down my spine.\n\nMy heart aches.\n\nHeat floods my face, as I gingerly perch on the edge of the large bed, the provocative white bikini and skin-tight skirt bunching around my soft, stuffed thighs. The curvaceous protrusions of my asscheeks spill out with an obscene jiggle. My vast breasts settle with an obnoxious bounce, their weight a constant reminder of my predicament. I had made a deal with the devil, a deal that ensured some peace during the day. Now was the time to pay up, and the guilt gnaws at my insides.\n\nAs soon as my derriere kisses the mattress, the bed frame whines beneath us, echoing my anticipation. Snib shifts towards me, his body exuding the virile musk that has my stomach coiling in twisted anticipation.\n\nUnable to meet his eye, my gaze falls to my breasts, encased in the unveiling tightness of the bikini top.\n\n\"Y’know,\" The gruffness of Snib's voice hardly drowns his perverse excitement. \"I do fancy this outfit of yours, cow tits. Y’ look like a proper bitch. Not some daft, so-called warrior.\"\n\nHeat prickles at my face, and my heart lurches viscously in my chest as he twirls the white string of my bikini top. The tug angles up my left boob provocatively, and he lets go suddenly. With a soft smack, my tit settles, jostling against its twin, causing an unwanted ripple of stimulation along my torso.\n\n\"Re-remember,\" I fumble with the words, latching onto the shred of power I have left. \"I'm only... only giving you a handjob.\"\n\nHis toothy, disdainful grin splays across his face, as his yellow eyes leer into mine. \"Yer job is to satisfy me, sugar tits. As long as I'm happy, ye can scuttle off.\"\n\nMy trembling hands reach for the paper bag I brought with me, the contents inside rustling softly. The gnome's shop downtown had been an embarrassing experience, but I had managed to purchase a small packet of a dozen condoms. The packaging is made of a rough parchment, sealed with a wax stamp depicting a stylized cockatrice.\n\n[Choice: Open the packet.",

It's smooth and cool to the touch, a stark contrast to the hot, pulsing flesh it's meant to cover.\n\nSnib watches me with an conceited smirk, his yellow eyes sparkling as he lounges lazily, exuding an air of unwarranted superiority. \"Hey, cow tits,\" he grunts, \"Yer making a gobbo feel unloved. Y'don't fancy the musky scent of yer master?\" His deep-rooted goblin accent makes my skin crawl, my cheeks growing hot at his crude words. \"Looked like ye were trying to scrub ol' Snib outta yer sheets and yer life!\" He jabs a pointed finger at me.\n\nA twitch in my belly surprises me, a shameful surge of arousal making the silky fabric of my sparse panties cling to me in all the wrong ways. The wetness between my quivering thighs makes me feel as if I'm melting right there on the spot. I try so hard to suppress the feelings, stomp them down into the recesses of my psyche, my now treacherous, feminized body has very different plans.\n\nSnib grins at me, lying back on the bed and crossing his arms behind his head. His huge cock twitches, all twelve inches of it uncoiling and flopping out onto his leg as he bounces it up and down.\n\nThe sight of Snib's goblin schlong, in all its monstrous glory, sends a shudder through my body. It's not even fully erect yet, but the length is still extremely intimidating.\n\nThe skin of it is an unsettling shade of green, darker than the rest of his body. Spidery dark green veins beat with life, pulsating under the sickly green skin of the shaft. They're so prominent, so invidious, feeding the beast of his arousal. They're thick and bulging, a testament to the blood pumping through them, feeding the growing erection.\n\nThe head of his cock is a deep purple, almost black in the dim light of the room. It's bulbous and swollen, drooling precum onto his thigh. The sight makes me light-headed...\n\nSnib's big goblin balls are nestled between his legs, splayed out in a display of pure dominance. They're large and heavy, covered in a thin layer of coarse hair that matches the color of his cock.\n\nI swallow hard.\n\nI can see every inch of him in horrifying detail. His cock twitches under my gaze, responding to my attention as if it has a mind of its own. It's a living, pulsing testament to Snib's virility, a weapon designed for one purpose only.\n\nI can't help but compare Snib's cock to what I used to have. His is so much larger, so much more dominant despite his gross little body. It's a constant reminder of what I've lost... and what I've become.\n\nIt’s repulsive. By that I mean, I SHOULD be repulsed by it.\n\nHis musk assaults my senses, continuously jolting my body into a state of arousal I bitterly resent. The intoxicating scent making my skin flush, my nipples tightening under the scanty fabric of the bikini top that serves as my only protection against Snib's lewd ogling.\n\nWithout thinking, I reach out to touch him. My hand trembles as I make contact with his spongy green skin. It's hot and smooth under my fingertips, twitching and pulsing with life. It’s like a little burst of electricity as I make contact.\n\nMy breath catches in my throat as I trace a vein along his length. It's thick and hard under my touch, throbbing with each beat of his heart.\n\nMy pussy throbs in time with him, growing wetter by the second.\n\nSnib chuckles, his laughter echoing in the room. \"Ain't ya forgettin' somethin', cow tits?\" he smirks.\n\nMy cheeks burn hotter as I realize what he's talking about. The condom. I was so caught up in… whatever I was feeling, that I forgot about putting one on.",

Can’t hide that from a goblin’s nose.\" His eyes gleam in the low candlelight.\n\nHeat floods my cheeks at his crude words, an inferno of humiliation and shame. He's right. I can SMELL my own embarrassing arousal in the air, a thick, musky perfume that broadcasts the dampness growing between my legs.\n\nMy body feels much more sensitive than it was last time.\n\nI can feel the slick dampness in my panties, the aching throb in my clit, the painful sensitivity of my jiggling breasts under the strained bikini top. And my nipples, they are pouting and perky, straining against the thin white fabric, almost as if they are *begging* for some goblin attention.\n\nWith hands shaking like leaves in a gale, I reach for the condom once again, trying to ignore the nauseating reality of what I'm about to do. My body is aching, practically screaming in its need, but my mind... my mind is a whirlwind of disgust, fear, and a morbid fascination I can't quite put down.\n\nMy hands are slick with sweat and precum as I keep trying to fit the condom onto him. Each failed attempt only adds to my humiliation, making me feel even more like a plaything for Snib's amusement.]Clutching the condom between my trembling lips, I muster what little courage I have left and lean forward.\n\n\"Ohh, yer going all out, eh, cow tits?\"\n\nI lower my head to his cock, my heart hammering in my chest as I draw in a shuddering breath. The thick length of his goblin dick twitches eagerly, precum still oozing from the angry, purple tip, and it makes me feel light-headed. Nonetheless, I press my lips to the rubbery sheath and begin to roll it down his shaft.\n\nThe first touch of the condom on his cockhead sends a shiver down my spine. It stretches thin, forming a tight seal around his bulbous glans. The taste of latex mingles with the bitter musk of his pre-cum, an assault on my taste buds that makes me gag. But I force myself to continue, hoping this extra effort will drive him to climax faster.\n\nWith my jaw aching from the strain, I work my way down his veiny shaft. My lips struggle against the thickness, stretching wide to accommodate his girth. Each inch feels like an eternity as I roll the condom further down, the rubber sliding over the hard, pulsing flesh beneath. My breath comes in ragged gasps, every hot exhale fogging the slick surface.\n\n\"Look at ya, sugar tits, workin' that cock like a pro,\" Snib taunts, his crude voice dripping with amusement. \"Betcha never thought ye'd be usin' those pretty lips to wrap a gobbo's cock, huh?\"\n\nThe words sting, but I'm too focused on my task. My head bobs up and down, trying to get the latex evenly distributed. The sensation is maddening, my mouth filled with the taste of rubber and the occasional streak of his musk. Each pulse of his cock sends hot vibrations through my lips.\n\nSnib's hands grip handfuls of my long black hair. He thrusts shallowly into my mouth at intervals, each push making me gag around the thick girth.\n\n\"Keep goin', cow tits,\" he orders, his grip tightening. \"Show me how much ye love takin' care of yer Master. Look at that—yer mouth all stretched 'round me big gobbo cock. Such a proper lil’ slut.\"\n\nThe thick pre-cum continues to leak from the tip, mixing with my spit and dripping down his shaft as I roll the condom downward. My mouth feels like it's on fire, my muscles screaming in protest as the rubber stretches over the obscene length. I try to adjust my grip, but my lips slip slightly, and I feel the rubber tug at my skin.\n\nFinally, I feel the condom reach as far as it will hgo - not quite the base of his cock, and I sit back, my chest heaving with exertion.\n\nThe sight of Snib's cock encased in latex is strangely grotesque. The rubber distorts his size and color, making him look even more alien than before. And yet, despite the barrier between us, his cock continues to throb with need, visibly straining against its confines.\n\nMy fingers close around his girth, the rubbery texture of the condom pulsing against my skin. His cock twitches in my grasp, throbbing with anticipation. I can feel his heat through the latex, a reminder of the raw virility that lurks beneath it. His cock feels dangerous, a weapon of debasement. I can feel how much it wants me.\n\nSnib grunts as I tighten my grip, his yellow eyes glinting with wicked amusement. He's sprawled out on the bed like some grotesque king, his short legs spread wide and his pudgy belly rising and falling with each gruff breath. Despite his diminutive stature, there's an undeniable dominance to him, a brute strength that belies his small size. His massive cock stands proud between his legs, a testament to his virility that leaves me feeling both disgusted and... intrigued.\n\nAs I move onto the bed on hands and knees, my breasts sway heavily beneath me. The skimpy bikini top is barely up to the task of containing them - they hang down like ripe fruits, their weight pulling down on my chest with every move I make. My nipples brush against the fabric with each sway, sending jolts of unwanted pleasure coursing through me. My whole body feels so sensitive.\n\nThe short skirt rides up as I bend over more, its tight leather barely covering my ample ass cheeks. The thin fabric of my panties digs into the soft flesh of my hips, creating an embarrassing outline that leaves little to the imagination.\n\nThe position is incredibly uncomfortable - not to mention degrading - but it seems to serve Snib's lecherous gaze well enough. He watches me intently from below, his eyes tracking every slight jiggle and bounce of my body.\n\n[Choice: Start stroking him.",

I know how pathetic this is. But I'm hoping it will be over soon.\n\nMy belly is tightening into knots - not from fear or disgust - but from pure, animalistic arousal.\n\n*What is WRONG with me?*\n\nThe goblin's chuckles ring out in the quiet room as I sit upright again and spit into my palm. The wet sound echoes off the walls and fills me with shame.\n\n\"That's it,\" he croaks out in his rough goblin accent. \"Get it nice 'n wet for me.\"\n\nThe words are like daggers in my chest but at this point, they only serve to stoke the fires within me even more.\n\nUsing both hands now slick with spit for lubrication, I return to stroking Snib's massive shaft again - this time with an added fervor that surprises even myself.\n\nAs time goes on, the room seems to grow hotter, the air thick with tension. I can't help but notice the way my own body is betraying me, responding to his every touch and lewd comment. I realize I’m fishing for his grunts, for signs of his pleasure.\n\nSnib shifts beneath me, his grubby hands reaching up to explore my body further. His fingers find their way to the mound of my pussy, barely covered by the thin fabric of my panties. I whimper and quiver at his touch, losing my grip on his cock as zaps of pleasure squiggle through me. He pushes my bikini to top the side and plays with my nipples with his tongue.\n\nIt's so intense. Embarrassing cunt-syrup trickles down my inner thighs as my goblin tormentor continues to rub me through the fabric.\n\n\"You've made quite a mess of yerself, cumdump.\" he grunts, running a finger up my thigh and collecting some of the slick liquid that has escaped from beneath my panties. He brings it to his mouth and sucks it off with a disgusting slurp. \"Tastes like a bitch who loves gobbo cock,\" he smirks, his yellow eyes gleaming with lust.\n\nThe humiliation washes over me in a fresh wave, but that only seems to fuel the fire inside. My body is so sensitive now, each touch sending shockwaves through me that threaten to overwhelm my senses.\n\nI suddenly realize that my hips are swaying rhythmically back and forth as he lazily rubs the soaked mound of fabric covering my fat pussy. It's as if I'm unconsciously trying to give him better access - leaning into his touch as if it's something I crave.\n\nMy mind is spinning, dizzy from both shame and this all-consuming arousal that has taken over my entire body. It feels like an itch that just won't go away - frustratingly intense and maddeningly out of reach.\n\n[Choice: Jerk him faster.",

I feel them both at once.\n\nDespite every ounce of my mental faculties screaming in protest, I can't deny that *something* about my horrid goblin overlord is affecting me profoundly.\n\nTears sting my eyes as I pump Snib's massive cock harder.\n\n\"Keep goin', tit-bitch.”\n\nMy massive tits bounce heavily with every pump, their weighty sway causing a dull ache in my chest.

But still I continue - because this is what he wants; this is what will give us another peaceful day tomorrow with Elara.\n\nI groan as I feel his heavy balls dragging along my tummy\n\n\"You know what else yer wife would love?” The question laced with cruel mockery makes my stomach twist in knots of anticipation and dread. “If she saw her once brave husband acting like a proper cow milking my cock with her big fat tits.\"\n\n\"Don’t... talk about El…\" The plea dies on my lips but he ignores it.\n\nA glint of satisfied cruelty flickers in his eyes. “She’d be so disgusted seeing her mighty hero husband, turned into a goblin's tit-slut.”\n\nHis words are like a slap to the face but they pale in comparison to the shock that courses through me when I feel another dribble of wetness slip down my inner thighs. Even amidst my horror and humiliation, there is a part of me that is starting to enjoy this.\n\n\"More,\" Snib grunts out roughly, feeling too much friction.\n\nMore what? More spit?\n\nWith trembling hands, I gather as much saliva as I can before letting it dribble onto the rubber shaft lodged between my breasts. The condom stretches taut against his wide girth and purple helmet that protrudes lewdly out from between her squeezed-together breasts. Every movement sends a new wave of sensation crashing through me - sharp and intense - making me writhe beneath him.\n\nMy over-sensitive nipples graze against the smooth rubber stroke after stroke - creating an intoxicating friction that sends shivers down my spine ebbing arousal in its wake.\n\n\"I... can't,\" I sputter out desperately, hot tears rolling down the sides of my face.\n\nBut Snib just chuckles harshly at that. \"Ye will... and ye'll enjoy every fuckin’ minute of it.\"\n\nI continue pumping my tits along his girth, but nothing more seems to happen. I don’t feel his tension building. He’s enjoying it, sure, but… ugh.\n\n\"Awww, cow tits... What's the matter?\" Snib's grating voice rings out above me. \"Is this too rough for ya?\"\n\nI whimper in response, meeting his gaze with teary eyes. \"I... I can't make you... with just my tits...\"\n\nA low chuckle resonates from above me as Snib pulls back and straddles my belly - his massive cock resting against the underside of my breasts. \"Then ye best figure something else out.\"\n\n\"Perhaps... I could...\" My voice trails off into a whisper. I don’t even want to say it.\n\nBut he hears me anyway, his yellow eyes sparkling with interest as he leans forward, grinning. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"I could... use... my mouth?” The words feel unnatural on my tongue and it takes all of my willpower not to retch at my own suggestion.\n\nHis reaction is immediate – a toothy grin that rivals the size of his monstrous girth.\n\n\"Not yer worst idea, but,” Snib grins down at me, his yellow eyes gleaming with cruelty. \"This would be so easier for ya without this.\" He tugs on the inflated end of his condom, filled to the brim with his slimy precum.\n\n\"No...don't,\" I whisper, whimpering at the inevitable, \"I don't... I can't swallow... any…\"\n\nHis laughter echoes in the room, a harsh, grating sound that slices through my pleas like a blade. \"Ye should have thought about that before ye just agreed to suck me off. With this rubbery thing, ye’ll be here all night.\"\n\nHe starts to roll the condom down his shaft and I can see it's internally glistening with his spunk - heavy, murky and opaque. My stomach twists at the sight but it's nothing compared to the smell that floods the room as soon as it's removed.\n\nGoblin musk. Pure, concentrated, pheromone-ridden goblin musk.\n\n[Choice: He ties the precum-filled condom to your bikini top.",

My nipples pebble sharply beneath my bikini top and another rush of wetness trickles down my inner thighs. My lower tummy clenches and blossoms with warmth.\n\nI protest weakly, my limbs trembling in terror and revulsion - but also tingling in an excitement that only seems to grow stronger with each passing second. My protests get whimpery and soft.\n\n\"Hmm? What was that?\" Snib grins down at me, his voice slick with amusement.\n\nHe’s holding his used condom in one grubby hand. His swollen cock bobs in front of my face, thick and oozing with arousal.\n\n\"Look at this,\" he sneers, waving the condom in front of my flushed face, \"An’ I didn’t even cum yet. But we can't have ya forgetting yer place now, can we, cow tits?\"\n\nThe rubbery balloon of goblin precum squishes as he bunches it in his fist. I can't tear my eyes away. It's a humiliating reminder of how this vile creature has power over me, of what my body is being forced to respond to. The slick, creamy preseed looks heavy and obscene in its rubbery confines, wobbling with each of Snib's jerky movements.\n\nMy eyes widen as my crude goblin master reaches down, his grubby fingers tugging at the string of my bikini top. I suck in a sharp breath as he ties the inflated end of the condom to it, his rough fingers grazing against the fat swells of my breasts. \"There,\" he grins, stepping back to admire his handiwork, \"A perfect decoration for a slut like ya.\"\n\nThe condom sways from its perch between my heaving breasts, its weight pressing down against my belly. My skin crawls at the warm, slimy feel of it against me, and I can't help but whimper in shame. It’s so obscene, so degrading.\n\nSnib's guttural laughter echoes in the room, making my cheeks burn even hotter. His stubby fingers wrap around his erect cock, stroking it leisurely as he watches me squirm. His musk fills the air, making my head spin and my body flush with unwanted arousal.\n\nI swallow hard, my gaze flicking up to meet his. He's waiting for me, his yellow eyes gleaming with anticipation. I can't believe this is happening to me. That I, once the great hero Aldric, am now lying beneath this wretched goblin, about to pleasure him with my mouth.\n\n\"Go on,\" Snib coaxes, his voice gruff and raspy, \"Ya got a lot of work ahead of ya.\" His eyes flit down to the condom tied to my bikini, a crude smirk playing on his lips. It's a stark reminder of what I have to swallow, what I have to do to protect Elara.\n\nHe slowly strokes his freed member a few times in front of my face - purring in satisfaction as precum leaks from his purple tip and lands searingly on my breasts.\n\n“I think yer gonna love how I taste.”\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nI whimper and turn away from him, but he grabs hold of my hair and forces me back into position. His cock brushes up against my lips – leaving salty trails of precum behind. The taste is vile – bitter and metallic – making my stomach churn with disgust…but still…there’s this small part of me that craves it.\n\nBuilding up the courage, I position my lips at the tip again, the dark green, veiny shaft twitching eagerly before my face. The smell of him—musk mixed with the bitter tang of his precum—is all-encompassing, filling my nostrils even as it sends an undeniable pulse of heat straight to my already sodden pussy.\n\n\"Open up wide, cow tits,\" Snib grunts, his thick goblin accent thick with arousal. \"Show me how much you love takin' gobbo cock.\"\n\nWith a trembling breath, I part my lips, feeling the hot, pulsing head of his cock push past them. The taste is immediate and overwhelming—salty, bitter, with an animalistic goblin taste that makes my head spin. It coats my tongue, thick and invasive.\n\nSnib chuckles darkly above me, his filthy fingers tangling in my raven hair, guiding my head onto his length. \"That's it, tit-slut. Take it deep. Show me how a hero sucks cock.\"\n\n[Choice: Obey.",

My hands are on his little green thighs, feeling the coarse, wiry hair against my palms as I struggle to pace myself. His cock is too large, too thick—it fills my mouth completely, pressing insistently at the entrance to my throat.\n\nHis girth fills me entirely, stretching my jaw to its limits—every inch I take makes it harder to breathe, the thick, salty sludge of his pre-cum coating my tongue, making me want to retch. It drizzles down my throat with each bob of my head, the salty taste starting to make my head swim and my core clench.\n\n\"There ya go, tit-slut, take it all,\" Snib growls, his hand tightening in my hair, guiding my head along the length of his shaft. \"Show me how much you love gobbo cock.

His other grimy hand wanders down, tweaking a nipple through the soaked fabric of my top, eliciting a sharp gasp that vibrates along his length. \"Bet yer missus can't make ya moan like that, eh?\"\n\nThe dual assault of his hands—one twisted in my hair, the other crudely pinching my nipple—drives me further into depravity. My moans become constant, punctuated by wet gags and chokes as he fucks my mouth with relentless gusto. Each thrust pushes more of his pre-cum past my lips, the salty taint of it seeping down my throat, a rancid river that fills my senses with his dominance.\n\n\"Don't forget the balls, tit-bitch!\" Snib barks, pulling back slightly to smear his leaky cock across my flushed cheek. \"Give 'em some love, or I'll make sure yer wife hears about what a greedy cum-slut you've become!\"\n\nTears stream down my face, mingling with the slick trail of his pre-cum as I lower my head, extending a timid tongue to lap at his heavy, veiny balls. The taste is stronger there, a bitter musk that clings to my taste buds, an indelible mark of my submission.\n\n\"Look at you, gobblin' up gobbo balls,\" Snib laughs heartily, the sound echoing grotesquely in the small room. \"Bet you never thought you'd be here, did ya? Yer wife thinks yer cleanin', and ya are! Yer a goblin's nut sack cleaner.\"\n\nWith every thrust of Snib's monstrous cock into my mouth, a splattering *schlap* resounds, the filthy slickness intensifying as his precum saturates my tongue, and begins pooling at the back of my throat. My head spins, the taste of it overwhelmingly foul—thick, briny, and unbearably strong. It's hard to think of anything other than the overwhelming presence of his member, the feeling of it filling my mouth almost completely.\n\n\"I bet she'd love to see you like this, wouldn't she?\"\n\nHis cruel words tighten around my heart like a vice. The image of my beloved Elara, walking in on this horrid scene, flashes before my eyes, making me choke back a sob. But Snib doesn't relent, his hips pistoning forward, pushing his cock deeper into my mouth, the purple tip hitting the back of my throat with each thrust.\n\n\"Mmm, all that heroism, all that power—gone now, ain't it?\" he continues, his voice a low, mocking growl. \"Now you're nuttin' but a gobbo's cumdump. Say it.\"\n\n\"Mhmm,\" I moan, the sound a choked, guttural noise as I try to pull back, only to be forced down again. \"I'm—I'm a gobbo's c-cumdump...\"\n\nEach word feels like another nail in the coffin of my pride, but the taste of his pre-cum is intoxicating, the pheromones flooding my senses. They cloud my thoughts, making it harder and harder to resist Snib's The potent musk fills the air, making my head light and my core burn with an unbearable heat.\n\n\"Suck it, tit-slut,\" Snib commands, his tone dripping with authority. \"Make those lips nice ‘n tight around my cock. Show me how much y’ fucking love that dick.”\n\nI comply, my lips tightening around his cock, creating a wet, obscene vacuum, cheeks hollowing out. The taste of his precum continues to intensify, its thick, briny flavor coating my tongue, spreading a numbness and heat through my entire body. I can't help it—moans and mewls escape my full lips, each one more desperate than the last.\n\n\"That's it,\" Snib groans, thrusting deeper into my mouth, his huge cock stretching my throat. \"You're gettin' the hang of it. Just imagine your wife walkin' in right now, seein' her beloved deepthroatin’ gobbo dick. Bet she’d be so proud.”\n\nThat's when I notice something strange - his words no longer sting as much as even a few minutes before.\n\nMy hands, once trembling with shame and resistance, are now steady, gripping his spongy, verdant flesh as I work to please him. Each helpless moan, each muffled sob echoes in the small room, reverberating against the bare walls.\n\nEvery wet *schluuuulp* as his cock slips in and out of my mouth, every filthy slurp as I struggle to keep up with his relentless pace, sounds louder in my ears. My brain becomes fuzzy, every sharp edge dulled, leaving only a primal need to submit, to please.\n\n\"Say y’ want my gobbo cum,\" Snib growls, his grip in my hair tightening. \"Say you’re a fuckin' slut for this gobbo dick.\"\n\nIt takes all my willpower to move my lips around him, forming the degrading words. \"I... I want your gobbo cum,\" I whimper, a shiver of arousal coursing through me. \"I'm a slut for... for gobbo dicks.\"\n\nThe admission sends another wave of wetness between my legs, my panties thoroughly soaked through, the sheer fabric clinging to my entrance. I can feel my mind slipping further into the fog of desire, the tingling warmth spreading from my core to every inch of my body.\n\nThe popping sound of the pre-cum filled condom tied to my bikini top bounces against my chest with every head-bob, a constant reminder of the toxins entering my brain.\n\nMy cunt throbs in time with every suckle on his veiny length - soaking itself further as though preparing for some pleasurable war that leaves me quivering from its ruinous call to arms.\n\n“Why be a hero,” Snib’s voice is guttural and labored, “when you're so fucking good at being a cow? Takin’ yer medicine like a good lil’ bitch.”",

My eyes roll back, my vision blurs with tears of shame and unwanted arousal.\n\nThe whole act is humiliating, his massive dick sliding slickly in the valley of my tits, the head occasionally popping out drenched in my saliva and pre-cum before going back into the warm embrace of my jiggling udders. The way he uses my body, how effortlessly he's reduced me to a pair of fuckable breasts, it breaks me yet sends shivers of degenerate delight down my spine.\n\n\"Look at ye,\" Snib chides crudely, \"a wet mess, aren't ya? Can't keep those fingers outta your slutty cunt, can ye?\"\n\nHe's right. My hand is between my legs, inside the tiny fabric of my panties, fingers working inside my puffy, dripping cunt. The sound is indecent—*schlick, schlick, schlick*. My other hand gropes at a breast, pinching the nipple hard before I squeeze it against his dick, somehow trying to anchor myself from floating away into this fog of perverse pleasure.\n\nHe laughs and just pulls out from between my breasts, watching me degenerate into this mewling, moaning mess on the bed.\n\n“Yer supposed to be pleasin' me, not yourself,” he teases mercilessly as he grabs my wrists, yanking them away from my sopping wet cunt. An involuntary yelp of loss escapes me as his massive hands replace mine, his thick digits expertly stroking the engorged lips of my pussy. The rough pads of his fingers drag against my clitoris, setting off fireworks behind my closed eyelids.\n\nI moan, a high, needy sound.\n\n\"Oi, sugar tits,” Snib's gruff voice breaks through the fog of my arousal. “Ready to take this cock, eh?” His massive length slides up between my quivering ass cheeks, hot and heavy, leaking precum that dribbles down the small of my back.\n\nThe cool trickle of his precum against my overheated skin makes me gasp, bringing me back to a harsh reality for just a moment.\n\n\"W-what...are you...d-d...\" My speech breaks, incomplete, as another wave of arousal hits me hard.\n\nHe grins, a lascivious twist of his lips as he looks down at me. “Oh? What was that dearie? Want me to put it in?”\n\n\"No!\" I manage to gasp out, still lost in the rhythmic abuse I'm giving my cunt, my hand a blur, my breaths quick and ragged.\n\nBut Snib is relentless, his obscene suggestion hanging in the air like a foul scent. \"Come on, let me slip it inside. Just for a bit. I promise I’ll wrap it up nice for ya. Bet 'ere won't be much difference for yer slutty hole, eh?\"\n\nHis cock nudges, insistent, at the slick folds from behind, the head pressing dangerously at my entrance. Each grind sends sparks of unwanted pleasure coursing through me, my moans growing louder, more desperate.\n\n\"No... n-no...\" I continue to whimper, my voice crumbling under the weight of rising, treacherous pleasure.\n\n\"Are ya sure 'bout that, cow tits?\" His tone is mocking, his breath hot against the nape of my neck as he keeps grinding his girth against me. The heat from his body, the weight of his cock, it's all becoming too much.\n\nHe pauses, pulling back slightly, only to snap the packet of a condom right next to my ear. \"See? Gonna wrap it up. Just a quick ride, sugar tits. You'll love it.\"\n\nAnd that's when I feel it—his huge, throbbing cock nudging up against my slick folds, pressing insistently. The tip just breaches me, barely entering, and it shatters the last of my resolve. My body stutters into acceptance, a quiet, defeated moan slipping past my bitten lip.[[Image: borderless]\nMy mind blurs further into depravity.\n\nHis goblin hands grip my hair tightly, controlling the movement, turning my mouth into nothing more than a tool for his pleasure. \"Look at ye,\" he grunts, a filthy sneer in his voice, \"a wet mess, fucking yourself while gobbo cock fucks your throat.\"\n\nSomewhere amidst the throat-gagging thrusts, I realize my hand has slipped beneath the thin fabric of the panties. My fingers are inside my pussy, exploring the swollen, slick folds of my cunt that quiver with unwanted need. The squelchy sounds of my self-pleasure mix with the sloppy, wet noises coming from my overstuffed mouth.\n\nMy eyes roll back as Snib's cock hits the back of my throat roughly, each relentless push meeting less and less resistance as my body submits on its own accord. My muffled moans vibrate against his thick shaft, and each time I pull back for air, I'm invaded by the musky, salty scent of his goblin precum, corrupting me further.\n\n\"Look at ye,\" Snib growls, yanking his slick, drooling cock from my mouth, leaving it gasping, spit dripping down my chin. \"A wet mess. Beggin' for it, ain't ya, tit-slut?”\n\nMy mouth feels oddly empty without his girth stretching it, a perverse sense of loss as saliva and precum mingle down my heaving chest. My hand works furiously between my wide-splayed thighs, the shameful *shlick, shlick* of my glistening pussy filling the quiet moments.\n\n\"Please,\" I find myself whining, my voice broken, breathy with thick lust, \"Please, put it back... I need it...\"\n\nWithout a word, Snib grips his smeared, glistening cock and feeds it back into my eager mouth. I suckle on it desperately, like a babe to a bottle, my lips forming a tight seal as I try to gulp down every inch he offers. Meanwhile, my other hand continues the humiliating rhythm against my dripping cunt, unwilling to stop the filthy pleasure.\n\nThen, he pulls out again.\n\nOn my hands and knees—I’m barely coherent as Snib hovers behind me, his massive fat cock drooling more precum down the valley of my jiggly ass cheeks. Each throb of his length against my plush, quivering buttocks sends spikes of heat coursing through my veins.\n\nHis voice, so full of carnal promise, rumbles above, \"Oi, sugar tits. Ready to take this cock proper now, eh?\"\n\nThe idea shatters me, tears pooling again as I shake my head, my voice a shattered whisper, \"W-what...are you...d-d...no... no...\"\n\nI can feel it, his tip nudging at my wet, slick folds, his bulk pressing insistently. \"Sure about that, hm?\" he challenges, his voice a rough caress that tickles all the wrong nerves.\n\n\"No... n-no...\" I continue to whimper out, my resolve crumbling as I feel the hot, wet tip of his cock pressing against my pussy, coaxing open my body’s instinctual need.\n\nHe grins, a monstrous gleam in his yellow eyes. \"Just a quick one with a rubber on, and I'll make sure you're well satisfied... fast n’ hard, ye'll love it.\"\n\nDespite my dwindling protests, the haze from his pheromones surrounding me, my body betrays my wishes, rocking back into his pelvis, pressing my fat ass against him. The heavy, hot girth of him smears his virile precum over my swollen pussy lips.\n\n*That's dangerous!*\n\n\"No...\" my protests grow weaker, each grinded thrust against my clit drawing moans more desperate than the last.\n\n\"Are ya sure about that?\" Snib's voice is coaxing now, a devil's whisper that frays my last vestiges of resolve. \"Feels like this pussy's beggin' for it.\"\n\n[Choice: ...just use a condom...",

The sight is obscenely erotic - each inch of his girth being slowly encased by the thin layer of rubber.\n\nA cold dread starts to settle in my stomach as I watch him fumble with the condom, trying to fit it over his oversized member. My mind races with thoughts of impending penetration. I've never... not like this...not...\n\nBut my body has other ideas. Each moan and squirm that escapes me is a traitorous testament to my own arousal. My legs coil and twist, squeezing together in a futile attempt to stave off the throbbing need building within my wet folds.\n\nAs if thinking about him summons the goblin into action, Snib suddenly barks out a raucous laughter drawing my attention back to him. He waves his fully sheathed cock before me - rubber straining against the monstrous girth - a symbol of debasement I'm doomed to endure.\n\n\"Look here, sugar tits.\" His gruff voice cuts through my hazy thoughts, bringing me back to reality. \"Yer gonna get fucked today. No stoppin’ that now.\"\n\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut, sending shivers down my spine and igniting butterflies in my stomach – but they're not exactly borne out of fear... more like anticipation...\n\n\"I-If you...you're going...please...\" I whimper out weakly, closing my eyes against this shameful sight and the wave of unwanted arousal it ignites within me. \"...just... just be gentle.\"\n\nSnib raises an eyebrow at that before letting out another round of gruff chuckles.\n\n\"Gentle?\" He smirks at me mischievously before grabbing onto one meaty handful of tit flesh, causing me to gasp aloud. \"We'll see about that.\"\n\nAs he squeezes harder and pulls me towards him roughly, there's an offer - something that helps cut through the foggy haze clouding my mind.\n\n\"If ye manage not ta cum before I do,\" he says, leering down at me with gleaming yellow eyes full of excitement and lustful anticipation. \"I'll leave ye and yer little wife alone for a whole week.\"\n\nMy heart skips a beat at his words – freedom? An entire week free from Snib's disgusting hands? The stakes are high but so is the reward ... Maybe if I can just endure...\n\n\"But,\" He adds with a devious smirk on his face while tugging harder on my breast making me whimper in both pain and pleasure alike, \"If ya do cum before me... yer in for a long night.”\n\nThe lewd sight of my massive tits jiggling under the weight of the precum-filled condom tied to my bikini top sends shivers running through me. Heat flushes across my skin, staining my cheeks a deep crimson as I watch Snib leer at me eagerly.\n\nHis stubby fingers wrap around the waistband of my skirt and with one gruff tug, he yanks it down. The sudden force sends tremors running through me, my body shaking in response. My flesh jiggles with each pull, the leather fabric catching on the generous swell of my asscheeks.\n\n\"Fuck,\" Snib grunts, tugging harder at the stubborn piece of clothing. The strain is too much for it and with a sharp rip, my skirt comes free. A soft gasp leaves me at the sudden exposure; a gust of cool air kisses my heated skin making goosebumps rise all over me.\n\nI lay there, sprawled on the bed in just my once-white panties and bikini top. I can feel Snib's gaze roaming over me - a predator eyeing his prey - sending shivers running down my spine.\n\nMy panties are so soaked they cling to the inside of my thigh like glue. The fabric is stretched taut against me, digging into the soft flesh of my child-birthing hips.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n\"Oi! Lift yer legs up,\" he orders gruffly.\n\nDespite myself, I respond to his command; lifting my legs up in the air and exposing myself even further to him. My heart races wildly in my chest; I’m so vulnerable under his hungry gaze.\n\nThe position forces my tits to bobble up and down on my chest, their heavy movement causing more precum to dribble out from the tied-off condom hung around them. The sensation makes me whimper in involuntary pleasure as another wave of arousal courses through me.\n\nMy hyper-sensitive nipples rub against the tight fabric, making them strain even harder against their restraints. A low moan escapes from between tightly clenched teeth as they respond to each slight movement with an electrifying jolt.\n\nEach heartbeat sends another rush of blood through them – keeping them hard and achingly sensitive – another constant reminder of what I have become.\n\nSnib's crude laughter echoes throughout the room, breaking through the foggy haze clouding my mind. My face flushes hotter as embarrassment creeps up on me once again.\n\nSuddenly, he's reaching for me again; his grubby fingers wrapping around one thick thigh before spreading it wider apart – opening me up for him. Each touch sends shivers running through me – sparks igniting deep within that fan into an inferno consuming all thoughts but one: anticipation.\n\nThe first touch of his cock against me makes me gasp aloud; caught between a moan and whimper as his precum-slicked length slides along mine. The overpowering scent of his musk fills the room – making it hard to breathe – invading every sense till all I can think about is him.\n\nThe world spins around me as I feel his rubber-sheathed cockhead press against me. Against the slick, swollen lips of my pussy. My heart beats wildly in my chest, each hammering thump echoing the impending doom of his invasion.\n\nThe moment of penetration is both painfully slow and devastatingly quick.\n\nOne second, I'm trying to prepare myself for his thrust - the next, I feel the tip of him pressing inside me. The sensation is immediate and overwhelming; a sickeningly erotic mix of pleasure and violation. His cockhead nudging past my folds, pushing into my body.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n*I'm sorry, Elara...*\n\n[Choice: He's going to fuck you.",

It's an alien sensation - something so different from any other I've ever experienced...\n\nMy body convulses involuntarily as he pushes a little further inside.\n\n\"Ooh,\" he chortles with a grotesque grin on his face, \"tight little twat ya’ve got there, ain’t it? Just squeezin’ around ma knob.\"\n\n\"Fuck, bitch, ye're wetter than a troll’s swamp,\" he grunts, shoving himself deeper, his fat cock plowing through my resisting folds.\n\n\"Pl-please,\" I stammer, my voice trembling with a mixture of dread and unwanted arousal. \"J-just... not too deep...\"\n\n\"Nah, ye made a deal, sugar tits, now ya gotta pay tha toll.\"\n\nMy heart is pounding in my ears.\n\n\"Fuck, yer tight!\" he grunts, his hips slamming against mine, \"Look at that—yer plump pussy's takin’ all of it!\"\n\n\"S-slower, please!\" I gasp out, my voice hitching in pure panic and discomfort as he continues shoving himself deeper. \"It’s too... too big...\"\n\n“Ha! Ain't no stopping now, ya silly little whore,\" he grunts, pushing another inch in. My pussy lips squelch around his thick, warty shaft. \"Yer cunt's begging for this.”\n\nHis cock is so thick, every inch a trial as it forces my inner walls apart. The grotesque warts and gnarly texture of his veiny pole scrape against my tender insides, sending jolts of shock through my nerves. I bite my lip, a whimper escaping as he pushes another inch in, my body spasming.\n\n\"Please, Snib, I—\" My voice cracks, tears streaming down my face as his length stretches me further. \"I'll do... I'll do anything...\"\n\nHe snickers.\n\n“Oh, ye already are, slut. This cunt's mine,” he hisses, shoving another inch in.\n\nThe smell of his putrid body and the sweaty exertion makes my stomach churn. His greasy, green flesh grinds against me, his little potbelly pressing heavily on my own flat, feminine tummy as he looms over me.\n\n“Feel that? Yer no longer a man. Just a whore for goblin cock,” Snib laughs, slamming more of himself in with gleeful abandon. My walls stretch obscenely wide, my tight little cunt barely able to handle his huge schlong. His warty cockhead feels like it's going to split me in two, the sensation a sickening blend of pain and an unnatural arousal that only makes it worse. “C’mon, sugar tits, beg for it,” he demands. \"Yer just a slut.\"\n\nMy voice catches in my throat, the humiliation of it all threatening to drown me. Every word he spits out corrodes what little dignity I have left.\n\nIt's a moment that should be sacred, cherished... given to a lover. Instead it's this... this monster. A goblin — a creature so beneath me, a green thing I wouldn't have deigned to kill before. Yet here he is, wearing down my resolve and taking away from me that which should never have belonged to him in the first place.\n\nAnd then…\n\n[Image: borderless]",

The fabric of who I was, the hero, the man seems like a distant illusion now. It's just me—Elise, sprawled under a little goblin, squirming beneath him.\n\n\"P-please, Master Snib,\" I whimper, my voice reduced to a high-pitched, breathy plea, soaked in desperation. \"Please, I n-need it... I need your big, nasty goblin cock. Ram it into my stupid little whore cunt. F-fill me up!\"\n\nSnib sneers down at me, his lips twisting into a grotesque grin. \"Beg harder, bitch. Show me how much ya want it.\"\n\n\"M-more! Please, more!\" I pant, my body betraying any semblance of dignity as I arch my back, pushing my throbbing pussy against his massive shaft. \"I’m just a slutty, fuck-hungry whore for your gargantuan cock!\"\n\nHis grubby hands grab my wide hips, fingers digging in as he aligns himself. My heart races, pounding against my chest like a war drum, each beat echoing the relentless desire that Snib has awakened in me. His grotesque, veiny cock, slick with the sheer amount of my own arousal, hovers at the entrance of my over-sensitized pussy.\n\n\"I can’t.. I can't hold back, Master!\" I squeal, my voice cracking with raw need. “*Fuck* me, please! Destroy my cunt with that giant goblin dick!\"\n\nWith one brutal slam, his girthy cock-head fully slams into me. The pain is excruciating — a guttural cry escaping my throat as I feel that last bastion shatter — my hymen - replaced by the fullness of his cock stretching me far wider than I ever imagined.\n\nSomething dark inside of me revels in the humiliation.\n\n\"Fuck me, use me, I'm just your slutty little fuck-toy!\" I wail, hating myself for every word, but the burning need between my thighs only intensifies with each vicious thrust.\n\nHe leans closer, his fetid breath washing over my face. \"Your wife's gonna despise you, cunt. She’ll never love this broken whore.”\n\n“Gods, yes! Destroy me! I'm nothing but a cock-hungry *bitch* for you!\" I cry out, my voice broken, frantically pumping my hips back against him.\n\nSomething snaps — something inside so vital, so inherently *me* that its absence is both devastating and darkly freeing. My mind blanks, leaving nothing but the raw, animalistic need.\n\n\"Fuck me... fuck me harder!\" I sob, tears and drool mingling as my face contorts in a grotesque mask of lewd devastation. \"Make me cum on your big, fucking goblin dick!\"[Your heroism was too low to fully resist...\"I-I'm not a slut,\" I whisper, the protest feeble, half-hearted even to my own ears. My thighs quiver.\n\n\"Relax, cow tits. This is happening whether ye like it or not...\"\n\nI close my eyes, trying to steel myself, chanting internally *for Elara, for Elara*. But his greasy hand slides under my lower back, pulling me closer, aligning my hips with his thrust.\n\n\"N-no, too big... it's too much,\" I gasp, a tear trailing down the side of my face.\n\nHis yellow eyes gleam. “Feels jest right to me, bitch. Yer gonna take every inch.”\n\nAnd then he hits it—the barrier of my hymen. The sharp pain momentarily brings clarity, and I thrash under him. “Ahh!” I shriek, the reality of my degradation hitting me—a hero, now pinned down, and *owned* by a creature I’d once considered vermin. A goblin, sinking slowly inside me.\n\nSnib rolls his hips, pressing relentlessly deeper. \"Come on, slut. Tell me what you’re thinking about. Your darling wife Elara finding you like this? Split open on goblin dick?”\n\nMy mind spins, his words slicing through the last tendrils of my resistance. “I...” My voice trembles, “She won’t... she can’t know. Please...”\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n“A little late for ‘please,’ ain’t it?” Snib chuckles darkly, giving a particularly rough thrust that tears through my hymen, burying himself balls deep inside me. I scream, a raw, torn sound that fills the room.\n\nThe pain is sharp, immediate, but it's soon drowned by a deep, crushing wave of disgrace as I feel him fully sheathed within me.\n\n“Ugh... m- Master… y-your cock… inside me…” I admit, the words feeling filthy and wrong on my tongue.\n\n“Yeah? Ye like it?”\n\n“N-no... I don’t... I can’t…” I stutter, but my body has other ideas, the initial shockwave of pain ebbing into a sickening pleasure. My pussy clenches around him tighter, each pulsing of his girth inside me firing nerves I never wished to activate. My body starts...\n\n...milking him.\n\n“That’s it, slut,” he murmurs, starting to move inside me, his hips grinding in deep, merciless circles. “Let go. Just be a good little cock sleeve for your goblin master.”\n\nMy resistance crumbles, each thrust eroding my will.\n\n“...fuck me,” I find myself pleading, hating how my voice cracks with needy desperation. “Please.”\n\nSnib laughs, derision lacing his bellows. “That’s more like it. Tell me you’re nothing but my fuck-toy.”\n\nTears stream down my cheeks, my breaths coming in ragged sobs as I cave completely under the weight of his words and the relentless pounding of his hips. “I’m your fuck-toy,” I confess, the words spilling from my lips in a litany of shameful acceptance. “I’m just a... a whore for your cock. Use me... please…”\n\nAs he ramps up his pace, the bed creaks under us. Each thrust sends a new wave of disgrace crashing over me, mixing with the perverse tendrils of pleasure that coil tighter around my spine.\n\n“You’re wrecked now, ain’t ya? Yer properly broke!”\n\n“I’m wrecked…” I sob out. My mind is a fog, overwhelmed by the intensity of his dick filling me up.\n\nSomething vital within me crumbles.]I clench my teeth and shut my eyes tight as his thick, grotesque member forces its way deeper into me. Every fiber of my being screams in defiance.\n\n“No,” I manage to gasp out, the word more a pained groan than a strong declaration. “I won’t... won’t beg for you, monster.”\n\nSnib’s filthy grin only widens at my defiance, his yellow, gleeful eyes burning into me as he leans close, his foul breath washing over me.\n\n“Oh, still fightin', huh?” His voice is a horrible, raspy whisper. “t’s gonna make it so much sweeter when ye finally break and admit you’re nothin' but a hole for my cock.”\n\nI bite down, swallowing back any sounds that might please him.\n\n“I am not... just a hole!”\n\n“We’ll see...”\n\nWith one brutal slam, his girthy cock goes all the way. The pain is excruciating — a guttural cry escaping my throat as I feel that last bastion shatter — my hymen - replaced by the fullness of his cock stretching me far wider than I ever imagined.\n\nSnib grins down at me, every vascular ridge and vein of his monstrous shaft buried balls-deep in my twitching body, spreading me open from the inside out. His girthy length throbs menacingly within me — marking its territory — claiming every last inch of me for himself.\n\nMy mind spins with raw confusion and humiliation as I lay there whimpering like some fragile virgin maiden being deflowered by her brutish captor. This isn't supposed to be happening… not to me… not...\n\nBut even as the pain recedes and is replaced by a wave of perversely welcome pleasure, realization hits me harder than any physical blow ever could: This is happening… to me… and there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nMy body wants it. Desperately.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nMy body rebels against my mind, dousing it in so much fuzz that I can’t think straight at all; every fiber of my being screaming for release amidst the onslaught of overwhelming pleasure coursing through me. The sensation of Snib’s massive member stretching my soaking cunt around him is too much.\n\nWith an obscene grunt, Snib pulls out only half-way before slamming back into me again— each hard thrust sending fresh cascades of ecstatic fullness and completeness washing over me. A gasping moan escapes my lips unbidden; the sound distinctly feminine and full of pleasure.\n\nBut along with the washed-out bliss came the familiar humiliation. The realization, like a cold slap in the face, that I’m being ridden mercilessly by a creature I once looked down upon.\n\nThe feeling of him going balls deep, finally making his whole length vanish inside my overused, overwhelmed pussy makes me scream—a sharp, piercing sound more animal than human. A profound break zips through my psyche, my thoughts splintering into chaotic fragments of raw, uncensored need.\n\n\"Ye're broken now, a proper slut.\"\n\nAs the room spins, Snib’s filthy, triumphant laughter echoes around me, mixing with the depraved sounds of our bodies slapping together, the filthy squelch of my abused cunt clinging desperately to his invading shaft.\n\n\"Say it, say you love gobbo cock!\" he commands.",

With each savage penetration, my self-respect chips away, replaced by an overwhelming biological arousal.\n\n\"M-master Snib,\" I pant, the words drooling from my lips, \"F- fuck! I love... I love your huge fucking goblin cock. Give me more. Ravage my slutty whore pussy!\"\n\nMy voice breaks, hitching between guttural moans and pathetic sobs. The shame is unbearable, yet it's drowned out by the sinful delight coursing through every nerve ending. My hips push back against his thrusts, eager for another dose of that brutal goblin dick.\n\nUnder the weight of his grotesque body, I’m nothing but a quivering mound of flesh, squirming and squealing beneath him, completely succumbed to the primal desire he’s stirred within me.\n\n\"Yes, fuck me, destroy me, I’m just a goblin-fucking whore!\" I scream, the echo of my own voice sounding alien, debased, making it clear to myself to how low I’ve sunk.\n\nThis is not good...]Snib's hands slap down on my curvy hips, gripping hard enough to bruise as he pulls me onto his thrusts. Each penetration is deeper, fiercer, as if he's trying to skewer my very soul on his goblin cock.\n\n\"No... no, I won't... I won't say it,\" I pant, every word a battle, spoken through clenched teeth.\n\nBut my plea dissolves into a high-pitched squeal, as shockwaves of unwanted pleasure course through my abused pussy. The resistance crumbles, each moan a stepping stone toward subjugation.\n\n\"Say it, COW TITS!\" Snib snarls, his face twisted in maniacal glee as he senses my breaking point.\n\n\"I— No! I can’t,\" I gasp. But it's too much; the feral, primal part of me is winning, driven wild by the intense fullness of his invasive girth.\n\nFinally, as he hits my cervix again, I break; what's the point? My voice comes out in a shattered whimper.\n\n\"I... I... ngh... I love it...\"\n\nThis is not good...]Even as I try to steel myself against the relentless onslaught, his grimy, powerful thrusts force pathetic moans from my lips. My body rebels against my mind.\n\n\"No... Please no more...\" I whimper, each word punctuated by a throb of my clenching pussy around his massive goblin cock. The sensation is too intense, too much, but I grit my teeth, trying desperately to withhold the satisfaction he craves from me.\n\nSnib's enjoyment only increase with my discomfort and weak resistance.\n\n\"Tight little fuck-cunt, can't handle my cock?\" he mocks, pumping with more vigor, pushing his thick, warty length even deeper. \"Fight all ye want, whore. Makes it so much sweeter.\"\n\nMy resolve falters, my voice breaking into high-pitched, miserable sobs as he continues his brutal pace, each thrust designed to break down my defenses. \"I-I...\"\n\nAs Snib grinds his hips into mine, he roars with delight, his grubby hands snaking their way up to my bouncing breasts.\n\n\"Fuckkn' hell,\" he grunts, wrapping his rough fingers around the heavy mass of my tits. \"These fuckin' udders!\"\n\nHe squeezes harshly and I can't bite back a gasp, panting for breath as the pleasure builds. My nipples tighten painfully at the rough handling, stabbing jolts of pleasure shooting down to my swollen clit.\n\nHe chuckles darkly at my reaction, giving each breast a sharp smack before beginning to pump into me again. My breasts react insanely - bouncing in successively larger arcs under each brutal thrust of his goblin cock. Each movement sends more precum spilling out from the condom tied to my bikini top, sloshing against my belly with each pendulous swing.\n\nMy mind spins helplessly and I can't help but whimper as he fucks me ruthlessly into the mattress - again and again with no reprieve for me or consideration for how it must look; a hero degraded like this...\n\n\"Like being stuffed fulla cock don't ya?\" he chortles crudely at me as if hearing my thoughts. \"Ye used ta slay dragons an' save kingdoms... now all ya good fer is taking dick... ain't that right? Ya like bein' reduced to this?\"",

My hips can't help but rise off the bed to meet him.\n\n\"Ughhh… Oh, fuck yes!” I gasp, an orgasm building like a wildfire in my core, threatening to burst through every defensive wall I once held.

The stench of his musk makes me want to gag but I focus on that - the revulsion at his touch, the sickening scent of him. Anything to keep that unwanted climax at bay.\n\n\"Ye think yer better than me?\" He jeers, angling his thrusts deeper inside me. My hips rise off the bed in reflex to meet his brutal rhythm - a traitorous response that only sends another wave of pleasure tearing through me.\n\n\"No!

It's a wild beast in my belly, clawing at my insides to get out.\n\nBut I won't let it win - can't let it win. I can't give this... this creature any more satisfaction than he already gets from defiling me like this.\n\nWith a grimace and a scream locked inside my throat, I pull on all my warrior’s training – mustering every ounce of willpower within me like a shield against the onslaught of ecstasy threatening to break through.\n\nI close my eyes tightly and force myself to picture Elara – beautiful Elara. Her soft smiles and gentle whispers help push back against Snib's onslaught – barricading myself within thought; willing away thoughts of Snib's cock plunging into the slick warmth of my bared cunt.\n\n\"Y-You' re nothing,\" I manage to choke out after a moment, even as another brutal thrust has stars flashing behind closed eyelids. \"I've... I’ve faced much worse enemies than you!\"\n\nSnib laughs cruelly at that and squeezes on one fat tit harder making me squeal aloud, “Yeah? Fought dragons with yer tits out, did ya?”\n\nWith each lewd slap of his balls against my rear, he continues to taunt me – crude words flowing from him like venomous poison.\n\n\"Stupid slut, thinkin' she's some hero... yer just another whore with big ol’ tits and a slutty pussy begging fer cock.\"\n\nA muffled scream tears free from clenched teeth as I throw all caution aside and clasp onto whatever will help keep me grounded in reality– hold off that impending climax now threatening to crash into existence with an intensity that terrifies even myself; so close now...\n\nSnib’s pace become frantic, snarls erupting from his throat every time he slams into me. His fingers dig painfully into my fat tits, lighting them afire with sharp sparks of inexplicable pleasure – sending me even closer to that precipice.\n\nWith a primal roar, Snib buries himself to the hilt inside me. My body instinctively clenches around his invading monster of a cock, furthering my own arousal in the process.\n\nHis belly slaps heavily against mine with every hard thrust as he grinds himself against me, his ragged breaths harsh against my neck. The disgusting scent of him mingles with the overpowering odor of our mixed sweat and amorous activities and it's almost enough to make me gag.\n\nThe bed squeaks and creaks madly beneath us as Snib continues to rut into me with all his strength; all semblance of self-control gone as his release looms over him.\n\nThen suddenly, Snib gives a final guttural groan and stiffens atop me. The obscene flesh-log lodged inside my cunt twitches and throbs ominously as I feel a sudden rush of warmth spreading through his length. [Choice: He cums.",

Empty those big gobbo balls inside me!\" I cry out, my voice breaking with every filthy word that pours out like vomit from my lips.\n\nSnib's filthy claws dig into my soft skin as he begins to cum. The first spurt is a shock, a hot flood that fills the condom inside me to brimming.\n\nBLURRTTT!!\n\nThe first heavy blast of cum strikes the inside of the condom, thudding against my cervix.\n\n\"Ahh... fuck!!!\" My back arches off the bed, pushing me deeper onto his pulsating shaft as he continues to fire relentless jets of thick, goblin seed.\n\nBLURRTTT!!\n\nAnother, and another—each one a deluge, inflating the condom wedged inside me. It's too much, too intense; the surges of his cum feel like they're trying to burst through the rubber, each spurt painfully stretching the latex thin, bulging obscenely inside me.\n\nThe pressure is incredible, indescribable. Each pulse seeks invasion, an inexorable force determined to claim me utterly.\n\nMy body responds instinctively, clenching around the ballooning condom, brutally stretched to accommodate the violent deluge of goblin spunk. The rubber strains, engorged with a vile concoction of potent, writhing sperm punching against its confines like a river against a dam.\n\n\"Ahh! Ughn!\"\n\n“Take it, whore!” he sneers, breath ragged and hot against my ear. “Take every last fuckin drop!”\"Oh fuck,\" I whimper at the feeling before quickly clamping down on the moan that wants to follow. But it's too late – whether from exhaustion or pure shock – I feel myself teetering dangerously at the edge again.\n\nI hold onto every ounce of control left in me but it's all draining out fast - being sucked out by the gravity-pull sensation at Snib’s final thrust - coupled with the sudden expansion deep inside my pussy - like hot furnace bellows pumping molten magma into an already overstuffed condom within my quivering depths\n\n\"No… No…\" I gasp out desperately, clenching my eyes shut hard as my sweaty palms claw futilely at the bed sheets beneath us.\n\nI can feel every ripple – each pulsating jet streaming from his cockhead filling up the condom within me; each shot inflating it more and extending deeper within its impaled depths. It's humiliatingly enormous now - turgid with spunk – distending itself audaciously to accommodate the fat jets of his potent seed stirring crazily within its rubbery shell - ready… just ready to burst forth from its confined prison.\n\nJust when I think I'm on the precipice of surrender, my control slips back into place. A white-knuckled grip on the last shred of my willpower as I hold off the impending wave of ecstasy that threatens to crash down on me.\n\nMy body shakes, my teeth clench and a whimper slips past my lips. Somehow, some way, I manage to stave off the climax.\n\nBut it's not quite over.\n\nA sudden emptiness floods me as Snib pulls his cock free from me with a wet schlick. My pussy clenches around nothing, unfulfilled and aching for something I refuse to give in to. The condom is still inside me, full to brimming with his potent goblin cum. It's the feeling of a rubbery bag full of hot, wriggling sperm stuffed inside me.\n\nThe smell hits me almost immediately - a pungent cocktail of bleach and musk cutting through the air.\n\nIt's disgusting... or... at least it should be.\n\nSnib yanks at the end of the condom sticking out of me and slowly pulls it out, making me wince with every inch it drags along my oversensitive folds. A wet pop echoes through the room as it finally comes free, trailing streaks of pussy juice down my thighs.\n\nThen, he grins that grotesque grin again and dangles it in front of my face. Fat droplets fall from it onto the sheets between us - each one a potent bullet loaded with his vile potential offspring.\n\nI'm surprised it didn't break - it is a HUGE load.\n\nHumiliation burns hot on my cheeks as he forces me to look at our combined mess; his powerful goblin seed swirling within, kept at bay only by thin rubber confines streaked on the outside by my own glistening juices.\n\nThe sight is disgusting and yet... the perverse satisfaction of having survived another round without giving him what he wanted delivers its own twisted thrill.\n\nMy mind spins, caught between relief and fear as Snib speaks again: \"Ye did good.. .

He can't be serious...\n\nBut the wicked grin on his face leaves no room for doubt.\n\n\"Ephemerals, no...\" I gasp as he reaches down and ties another bloated condom next to its sibling on my bikini top. The scent of spent jizz hits me like a punch to the gut - thick and heavy with his musk mixed with a pungent smell that's undeniably... dominant.\n\nThe second condom is so much heavier than the first one - so engorged with cum it feels like a small water balloon pressing against my belly. The rubbery mass squishes obscenely under its own weight, sending streaks of cold precum spilling over my glistening underbelly in long trails.\n\nIt's disgusting, but there's an undeniable thrill coiling within me; a spark of perverse satisfaction that comes from seeing him empty himself into me and then leaving his seed as a mark of our twisted encounter.\n\nThe sight is beyond humiliating - each filled condom is a testament to how far I've fallen; from Aldric the Great to Elise the Cumdump.\n\nHis next words send chills racing down my spine: \"Now let's see how much more ye can take before ya break.\"\n\nI shudder involuntarily at his threat, glancing down between us where his monstrous cock still stands erect – hungry for more despite having just emptied itself inside me.\n\nHis skin pulses ominously against mine – each beat sending sparks of panic shooting up and down my spine as he leans in closer to whisper darkly in my ear: “This time… I want ye screaming.”[Choice: He pushes you into doggystyle.",

I-I was a hero...\" I babble nonsensically as the pleasure begins to crest, the waves crashing against my weakening resolve. My world shatters around me as I teeter on the edge, ready to plunge into the abyss of ecstasy.\n\nOne thing that remains clear among the chaos: I'm no longer the mighty Aldric the Great, but fully Elise — a woman being rutted like a bitch in heat by a goblin.\n\nAs he SLAMS into me, my whole body lurches forward, my breasts swinging wildly beneath me.

Fuck!\" I yowl pathetically, struggling to even stay conscious.\n\nThe wicked intensity of his thrusts have reduced me - the Hero Aldric to one thing, and one thing only - a drooling, stammering, overflowing pussy.\n\nI'm no hero anymore. I'm a dumb, pillowy, fucked little princess with cum-filled condoms tied to my bra strings. Tits bouncing and flopping around. Pussy lips stretched obscenely wide to accommodate every inch of goblin dick.\n\n\"U-UNGHHHH~! E-end... Eng-AGHHHHH!! Fuck... AH-AHHhn! Sn...

My eyes, wide open yet unfocused, eventually cross; spinning as Snib’s fat cock continues to pound deep inside my quivering cunt.\n\n“S-still…” I babble incoherently.

Each pulsation of ecstasy from the big-dicked goblin sends a fresh, wriggling stream of the thick, pungent semen into the ballooning sheath.\n\nMy senses are overwhelmed by the disgusting, musky scent of his release — a heady blend of goblin pheromones and the faintly acrid tang of their seed, clouding my mind even further as I struggle to retain any semblance of thought.\n\nWith a wet *plop*, Snib pulls out, the now fully-inflated condom hanging heavily from his spent cock. It's another wriggling mass of yellow-tinged goblin sperm, packed obscenely into the latex sheath.\n\n“Look at this, ye fuckin’ disgrace.

It’s only when he grinds his slick cockhead against my entrance again that reality begins to filter back through the fog clouding my mind.\n\n\"I ain't done with ya yet,\" He grins down at me – his yellow eyes gleaming with cruel satisfaction as he lines himself up for another round. \"I'm gonna keep poundin' this sweet little pussy 'til I've had my fill.\"[Choice: He adds the full condom to your collection.",

Despite this being his thirteenth cumshot of the night, it's shockingly thick and pungent, filling every corner of my mouth with its mind-melting submission pheromones.\n\nSnib grins at me, a devilish glint in his eyes as he reaches down and almost tenderly closes my chin. My mind numbed and broken, I swallow the hot, steaming, bleachy mess without a second thought. It slides down my throat and into my stomach as though to remind me that I'm nothing more than a receptacle for Snib's pleasure.\n\n(:9))[[But he still wants to cum again...]The room is a fucking disaster, a debauched circus of sexual ruin and I'm the center act, lying sprawled on the soaked, sperm-stained sheets. Every heavy breath I take is a wet gurgle, my face glazed with goblin cum, blocking one eye and clogging my nostrils. My bikini top now sags under the weight of cum-filled condoms.\n\nSnib sits beside me, panting like a dog after a run. His massive, vile cock, still oozing the last of his jizz, twitches as he looks down at me, his eyes gleaming with a depraved excitement that chills my already-abused body. It's unreal.\n\nThe bastard is getting hard again.\n\n\"FUCKKKKK,\" he groans, each syllable dripping with filthy glee. \"Lookatcha, my perfect little cum-dump. All fucked out 'n still makin’ me hard.\"\n\nHis cock, that massive, thick, revolting thing, rises again, like a phoenix from the jizzy ashes. My eyes, crossed and unfocused from the overwhelming sexual anarchy I've been subjected to, watch in disbelief as it bobs eagerly at his words.\n\n\"M-master, p-please...\" My voice is a whimper, a pathetic, noise lacking any real conviction.\n\nI am just so exhausted.\n\n\"Nah, slut,” he chuckles darkly. \"We ain’t done. Yer little asshole is still untouched. Gonna plow that tight, pretty hole. Don’t worry, ain't gonna knock ya up, just gonna stretch yer slutty ass!\"\n\nTears streak through the thick layers of cum on my face as he grabs my hips, yanking me up. I'm barely aware, my mind a shattered jumble of fuck-pink mush, as he positions me. The cold air hits my sopping wet, swollen pussy—the feeling almost alien after the heat of his incessant pounding.\n\nMy bikini bottoms—transparent from my own cunt-juice—cling embarrassingly tight to my swollen lips. Snib's fingers dig in, pulling them aside with a wet snap as he aligns his grotesque cockhead with my unspoiled hole.\n\n\"You've been such a good, stupid little fuck-toy,\" Snib sneers, the praise slipping through his teeth as venom might drip from a snake's fangs.\n\nHis spit lands directly on my trembling puckered asshole, the warm glob mixed with the cool air making me shiver. He rubs the head of his cock against my ring, smearing the thick, slimy mixture over and around the tight opening. The scent of his musk, thick and heavy, fills my senses, drawing a sick, twisted arousal from the pit of my stomach.\n\n\"Relaaax,\" he growls, pushing against the resistance of my untouched hole.\n\n“Nhhhh— Noooo, it’s too big!” I squeal.]Covered in the heavy sticky spurts that now drape wetly across my face, I can't help but sob as the full weight of what just happened sinks in. Snib collapses next to me on the bed, sounding refreshed and satisfied after blowing an unbelievable 13 loads.\n\n\"Heh, needed that,\" he says. \"And now you're finally mine... my cumdump.\" His gruff voice sends shivers down my spine as he continues to taunt me even in this ruined state. \"Ye can go now,\" he says dismissively. \"I'll see ya again tonight.\"[Choice: Try to get out of bed...]",

But it's a weak, futile plea, almost drowned out by the jiggling of the cum-filled condoms dangling humiliatingly from what feels like every bit of my body.\n\nSnib chuckles, lifting his cock like a weapon.\n\n\"Shut it, whore. You're gonna take my fat goblin cock up your pretty little asshole and you're gonna fucking love it.\"\n\nHe's lined up behind me, his fat, monstrous cock throbbing and twitching with cruel anticipation. Heat radiates off it.\n\nWith a filthy grin plastered across his warty face, he grabs his grotesque fuck-hose and ***SLAPS*** it down onto my reddened, wobbly ass cheeks. The impact sends a filthy, wet sound echoing through the dank room, like raw meat slapped against a butcher's block.\n\n\"Fucking sluuut,\" Snib snarls with vile affection, each syllable dripping with degradation, \"gonna stretch out your pretty little shithole. Time for your hero ass to take a cock beating!\"\n\nHe positions his quivering cock at my trembling entrance, his hands gripping my hips. On his first shove, his dick bends awkwardly, flopping against my ass—sending another **SMACK** reverberating through my flesh.\n\n\"Fuckin' tight ass,\" he grabs my hips roughly, pulling them up to give him better access.\n\nThe third attempt, his fat cockhead just smears its nasty mix across my ass, slipping away again with a wet, humiliating *flop*.\n\nThen, his huge mushroom head finally aligns, nudging against my virgin pucker. The pressure is *terrifying*.\n\nOn his fourth thrust, that massive goblin head ***POPS*** through, breaching my tender ring.\n\n\"*AAAAAGH!!!*\"\n\nThe scream tears through me, a horrid blend of agony and the deepest, sickest sorts of pleasure. It feels like I'm being split in two.\n\n\"Fuuuuck, there it is!\" Snib howls triumphantly, pumping his hips to sink deeper. \"Every fuckin' hole destroyed. You're nothing but my cum receptacle now.\"\n\nMy mind can't form a coherent thought anymore; it's a haze of pain, pleasure, and the overwhelming reality of being fucked in the ass by a monster.\n\n\"Ohhh god... please... it's so big,\" I gasp out, my voice a choked sob. The sensation is too much, his dick too thick, stretching me open in ways I've never felt. It feels like I'm being split apart, but there's also a deep, guilty warmth spreading through me.\n\nEvery pull out is agony, every push back in a skewer of fiery pain mixed with delirious pleasure, opening me up more and more.]Bracing myself is the only thing I can manage—the only semblance of control left in my utterly degraded state.\n\n\"Ready fer the ride of your pathetic, slutty life, cow tits?\"\n\nI feel the first heavy slap of his nasty fuck-stick against my fat, wobbling ass cheeks. The impact jiggles them, rippling obscenely. \"UGH—FUCKKK!\"\n\n\"Yeah, look at this slutty ass, quivering and all ripe for my big goblin cock!\" he bellows, the room filling with his foul excitement. \"Can't wait to fuck em.\"\n\nMy throat tightens with fear. I don't know what to do except stay perfectly still and hope it's over quickly.\n\nThe slimy tip of his grotesque cock prods at my trembling hole, smearing it with a disgusting mixture of my own cunt-squirt and his thick, stinking pre-cum.\n\nThe first push is a sickening flop—his massive prick bends awkwardly, smacking wetly against my quivering asscheeks.\n\n\"NGHH, fuck! Hold still, ya stupid cum-hole!\"\n\nI whimper, more drool leaking from my mouth as his rough fingers dig painfully into my hips. He aligns himself again, grunting with exertion. On the second try, his cock just slides along the sweaty valley between my cheeks, the tip leaving a sick trail of pre-cum.\n\nHe curses, then pulls back for another attempt. His third attempt isn't much better, the tip of his cock flopping against my hole but not finding purchase, just slapping my abused flesh and making me squeal again.\n\nMy mind is a pitiful haze, every slap, every crude word sinking me deeper into debasement.\n\n\"I said hold still, you fucking whore!\" Snib snarls.\n\nFinally, on the fourth attempt—\n\n*P-POP*!\n\nI scream as his huge purple helmet breaches my tight, untouched ring.\n\n\"AGHHHHH— OUCH!\"\n\n\"Take that, bitch!\" Snib howls in triumph, a vile grin splitting his face as he shoves more of his massive green cock into my ass. \"You're mine all the way now, ass-cunt!\"\n\nThe room spins, my vision blurs with tears as his monstrous dick stretches my asshole wider than I ever imagined possible. The pain is fucking raw, an inferno blazing through every nerve ending.\n\nEach pull-out is a drawn, slippery noise—*schluck*—as if he’s desecrating my very soul. Then he thrusts back in, sheer brutality as his veiny prick spears through my gutted depths. \"UNGH—FUCKKK!\"\n\n\"FEEL that?! Goblin cock splitting yer hero-hole!\" Snib mocks, his voice a sick melody of domination and ridicule. \"All pathetic heroes should get their asses fucked like this, shouldn't they? I bet then they'd never feel half as proud! Yer experiencin' a real goblin fuck-staff!\"\n\nHis words are almost as harsh and violating as his cock ramming in and out of my ass. Each thrust sends waves of sick pleasure mingling with the agonizing pain, shaking me to the core.\n\n\"This is what you were made for, Elise!

It hurts!\" I scream, but my cries are muffled against the sperm-soaked sheet. He's so deep, each slam of his hips making my fat cheeks wobble and jiggle.\n\nUnder him, I'm nothing more than a fucked-out doll—the once great hero now just a squealing bitch, reduced to a twitching mass of hyper-sensitive nerves, bouncing and jiggling around his massive, veiny cock.\n\n“Lookatcha! Lookatcha!” Snib snarls, the rough words grating against my burning ears. “Yer disgusting! Yer just a filthy cum-bucket, ain't ya?”\n\nI can only whine, writhing under his overpowering thrusts.\n\n“Thought yer ass was for shitting? No, bitch!

My slowing, mindless whimpers become loud, needy moans. \"*OoooOOOoooh*!\"\n\nSlowly, it twists and warps into something else. There's a strange heat brewing in me, not the molten lava of his cock stretching me beyond belief, but something hotter—something that makes my empty cunt twitch and my nipples tighten even more.\n\nHis cock, that horrifying, vein-choked rod of goblin meat, starts to feel... good.\n\nMy insides, once screaming in agony, now ripple and coax against his monstrous girth.\n\n“Gods—” I moan, my voice a drawn out cry of sick ecstasy. “It... it feels...”\n\n\"Turning into a fuckin' goblin ass slut, aren'tcha?\" he gloats, yanking my hair again, pulling my head back to let my moans echo through the stale, cum-scented air.\n\nHis thick green rod pistons in and out of my wrecked ass, sending jolts of unwanted, filthy pleasure coursing through my veins. My mind forces back the humiliation, the shame, the horror of being ass-fucked raw by a monster, and focuses instead on that filthy warmth blooming inside me.\n\nHis pace quickens, his thick rod churning up my guts, his prong mashing against the delicate nerves inside me.\n\n\"Fucking cum!

The obscene size and heat of his absolutely writhing goblin cock make me nauseous, trembling with each wet slap of his hips against my jiggling ass.\n\nI feel him twitch.\n\nHis massive cock, buried balls-deep inside me, seizes up.\n\nHe's going to cum. Inside me.\n\n\"Gonna... gonna fuckin' nut insi'de ya, cow tits! Nut in yer pretty little asshole!\"\nhe snarls, each word wrapped in sadistic pleasure.\n\nThe pressure in my rectum spikes, a heat so intense it's unbearable.\n\n\"This is a big un'. Gonna fill yer ass with so much of my nut. Gonna mark you inside, deep where no one can fuckin' see but you’ll *feel* it. You’ll know you're stuffed with gobbo seed!\"\n\nI whimper, my voice barely a squeak through the overwhelming mixture of drool and gunky goblin spunk already coating my lips. It's too much. He's too deep. My body shudders as his inhuman prick twitches inside me, the hot, slimy precum no doubt beginning to drizzle.\n\nI can actually feel the massive veins wrapped tightly around his shaft as they expand, pushing grotesquely against the already strained walls of my rectum. It’s like having a live, squirming animal trying to burrow further into my body; its movement sending ripples of both pain and a sick, twisted form of pleasure that I loathe to acknowledge.\n\nThe sensation begins subtly—with a heavy throb near the opening of my rectum. It’s a pulse, like the rhythmic beating of a heart. It shifts, it preps—and then, with a surge of pressure that makes my eyes water, it happens.\n\n(:\"ch16/anal creampie internal view.mp4\")\n\nBLURRRRT!!!\n\nThe first spurt is less a release and more an explosion. It rockets through his shaft with enough force to jerk his hips against mine. A hot, thick stream of goblin cum blasts into my bowels, the intense pressure making my eyes bulge.\n\nIt's a foreign, uncomfortable warmth that sears through my insides, stirring a mix of intense discomfort and shameful pleasure. The heat spreads, radiating outwards and creeping up my colon.\n\nHis big, green balls twitch against me, more and more of his sperm blasting into my ravaged ass.\n\n(:\"ch16/cumflate.mp4\")\n\nEach rope of his cum fills me deeper, stretching the sensitive walls of my intestines. My abdomen tenses reflexively, muscles clenching hard against the unnatural fullness spreading through me. I feel my stomach distend slightly from the inside, the sharp inflation a stark, hard swelling against my spine.\n\n\"Yeah, take it, hero! Feel my hot jizz coating your insides—fuckin' plastering your guts with goblin cream!\"\n\nAnother throbbing jet of cum surges up, the nauseatingly warm blast followed by several more, each one as violently forceful as the last. His seed rushes up through my colon, filling me to an almost bursting point. My gut churns with the vile hot liquid, the sensation so intense I fear it might actually rupture.\n\n\"That's it, tits-fer-brains, take all my nut. Feel it climbing up, filling ye from the ass up to yer fuckin' THROAT!!!\"\n\nHis words are no match for the biological reality of his claim. I feel the cum rise, a tide of filth making its way inexorably upward, pushing against the natural contractions of my digestive tract. The pressure is immense, unbearable, as if my organs are being forcibly rearranged. His seed infiltrates further, seeping into my upper colon, swirling around, the degrading warmth making me dizzy with disgust and an unwanted, shameful arousal.\n\nIt reaches my stomach. The sheer volume of his ejaculation is so immense, I can actually feel my belly swell outward, the stretched skin tight and hot. The pressure from inside against my diaphragm makes it hard to breathe, each gasp a labor fraught with the thick scent of bleach and musk that is utterly overwhelming. My throat burns with the impending invasion, an acid sting that heralds the arrival of his cum into my esophagus.\n\n\"Now yer gonna taste it too, bitch. Gonna cum right outta yer fuckin' mouth, filled to the brim with my goblin spunk!\"\n\nIndeed, as if on cue, the first dribble of his thick, pungent semen breaches my throat, pushing past my gag reflex. The taste is foul, an appalling mixture of bleach and decay, each glob that escapes my lips accompanied by a burning humiliation that sears my very soul. I choke, I gag, but the cum doesn’t stop—it spills from the corners of my mouth, streaking down my chin in humiliating rivulets.\n\nSnib’s jagged, triumphant laughter pierces the haze.\n\nLook at that! My cum bustin' right outta your mouth! You're nothing but a filled up cum tank, hero. Took it all, didn’t ya? My record fuckin' load!\"\n\nHis hands, still gripping my hips, pull me back against him in one final, possessive jerk. His cock twitches, a last few dribbles of hot goblin seed painting my insides, ensuring every part of my intestines, my stomach, even my throat is biologically marked.\n\n[Choice: He pulls out.",

Waddling like a pregnant sow!\" Snib cackles.\n\nThe moist slickness of spilled cum underfoot betrays me, and I slip. My knees buckle, and I crash face-first into a nasty, sticky puddle of goblin jizz. The impact jars me, and a horrifyingly loud ***BLURRRRRRTTTT!!!*** erupts from my over-filled ass.\n\n\"Fuck! Fuckkk—UNGH!\" My cries are mingled with heavy gurgles as more cum leaks out of my mouth, joining the expanding pool on the floor.\n\nThick, heavy ropes of goblin cum spew out, splattering against the wall with wet, disgusting **SPLATS**.\n\nSnib is practically howling with laughter now. \"Ha! Look at ye, squirting my nut like a fuckin' fountain! What a mess!\"\n\nHe's right. I *am* a mess. A filthy, utterly humiliated mess. I push myself up onto shaky hands and knees, the squelch of cum beneath me making my stomach churn. Trying to regain some semblance of control, I awkwardly squat, feeling the intense pressure in my overstuffed bowels urging me to expel the remaining load.\n\n\"Push it out, hero!\" Snib taunts, his voice dripping with mockery.\n\nWith a deep groan, I bear down. The first expulsion is a loud, obscene **GLOOOOP!**, a thick stream of cum bursting from my stretched, gaping asshole. It hits the floor with a heavy, nasty thud, splashing my ankles with residual filth.\n\n\"Ahhh… FUCK!\" I cry out, the sensation sickening yet also very relieving.\n\nEach push is accompanied by a deep, visceral clench of my overworked muscles, the sensation in my raw, tender anus a blistering reminder of Snib's brutal invasion.\n\n\"More! There’s more! Gut that cum tank!\" Snib urges, dancing around with perverse glee as he watches me disgrace myself further.\n\nAnother **GLOOOOP! GLOOOOP!** follows, each one more forceful than the last — thick, heavy ropes of filthy goblin seed ejecting from my body, painting the floor with more layers of disgusting, viscous fluid.\n\nThrough tears and choke-sobs, I push again, harder. The cum floods out, easier now, the stretched rim of my asshole allowing the viscous, pungent spunk to flow freely. I feel a wild, demeaning pang of relief with each expulsion, my mind reeling from the surreal, grotesque reality of my situation.\n\n\"Look at ye! Pumping out my seed like yer a fuckin' well and spigot!\"\n\nEach jet of cum expelled brings with it a depraved, involuntary shudder — a filthy pleasure firing through my wrecked nerves. The floor around me is a swamp of goblin spunk, reflecting my utterly ruined state. My bikini, weighed down with the heavy, cum-filled condoms, sags grotesquely as I gasp and moan.\n\n\"Yer jest a leaky, cum-stuffed hole now!\" Snib points and laughs.\n\nFinally, after what feels like an eternity, the last heavy loads of cum sputter from my gaping ass. My entire body trembles with exhaustion and overstimulation, each nerve ending screaming from the relentless physical and emotional toll the night has taken. I collapse into the sticky, cum-drenched mess beneath me, panting heavily, every breath a labored gasp.\n\n\"Look at that gape! Could toss a coin in there and make a wish!\"\n\nI lie there, broken, gasping like a beached whale amidst the puddles of goblin cum.

The metal collar around my neck bears the weight of two more cum-filled condoms, and the last one in my hair seems to press against my brain with each jiggling movement.\n\nMy vacant eyes struggle to focus on the wooden door of Snib's inn room as I shakily push myself up from the bed. Each movement sends ripples through my fat, jiggling tits, weighed down by the obscene fullness of the cum-filled condoms. Snib's lewd laughter and cruel mockery ring in my ears as I stumble towards the door.\n\n\"Good luck explainin' this to yer wife,\" he sneers, and a fresh wave of shame washes over me.\n\nI glance at my leather skirt lying torn on the floor - another casualty of tonight's debauchery.\n\nAs I reach for the door handle, my legs give out, almost sending me crashing to the floor.

Sweat glistens on my skin, slick and sticky like Snib's seed that still clings to every inch of me.\n\nWith a deep breath, I force myself upright once more - determined to make it back home.\n\nAs soon as I step into the hallway of the Silver Stag inn, I feel exposed and vulnerable - like a hunted animal with nowhere left to run. My thick legs shake with every step; barefoot and uncertain on the cold wooden floorboards beneath me. My massive breasts jiggle heavily with each movement; their weight now magnified by the overstuffed condoms pulling down on my bikini top.\n\nWith each step, my panties begin to slip - their elastic waistband strained under the weight of four more cum-filled condoms threatening to bare my slick pussy to anyone who might see. My shaking hands desperately tug at them; trying to keep them in place as best as I can manage in my dazed state.\n\nThe condom bouncing atop my head feels like a cruel crown, mocking me with each weighted slap against my skull; a constant reminder of how far I've fallen from grace as it spills goblin sperm onto me.\n\nA soft moan escapes my lips - sounding broken and lost even to my own ears - as I begin to descend the inn's staircase.

I'm thankful that no one is at the front desk, but as I navigate through the dimly lit room, I notice a figure sitting in the shadows - smoking a pipe. My heart skips a beat as I recognize him - Zephyrion.\n\nI stare blankly at the wizard, tears streaming down my cum-covered cheeks as he speaks to me in that cold, calculating tone of his. The weight of the remaining condoms still clings to my body, dragging me down both physically and emotionally. As Zephyrion approaches, I feel my legs wobble beneath me, ready to buckle at any moment.\n\nHe raises his metal rod to cast light on my humiliated form, inspecting the mess that I have become. My eyes avoid his piercing gaze, their focus too blurred by my state of arousal and shame.\n\n\"I have been observing the magical fields from afar,\" Zephyrion says without a hint of sympathy. \"The bond between you and the artifact appears to be greatly reinforced during certain... activities.\" His eyes narrow as he glances at the cum-filled condoms adorning my body.\n\n\"Why didn't you stop him?\" I sob quietly.\n\nZephyrion ignores my question and continues his inspection - examining each condom with clinical detachment. His rod hovers over me like an icy specter as he studies every debauched detail. He seems particularly intrigued by how flushed my skin has become and the glazed look in my half-open eye.\n\n\"I noticed a significant spike in energy in the evening,\" he continues coldly. \"It seems that when Snib dominates you... or when you 'form a bond' with him...\" He pauses for a moment before continuing, \"the connection with Maraan becomes stronger.\"\n\nWith an air of disgusted disinterest, Zephyrion uses a pair of metal tongs to remove one of the massive cum-filled condoms from my body, placing it into a sealed bag for further analysis. I shudder at the humiliating touch but make no move to resist or protest.\n\n\"Now listen carefully,\" he says in a tone that brooks no argument. \"I understand this experience is unpleasant for you, but when you do nothing, there is no progress for me to study. I've given Snib permission to be aggressive, as long as he does not impregnate you. Mayor Brambles has made it clear that prolonging your transformation is not acceptable. We all want this situation resolved quickly.\"\n\nAs his words sink in, my heart races with a mix of fear and despair. I feel like a pawn in their twisted game - an expendable piece to be manipulated for their purposes. I can’t think of a response that does justice to my feelings. Plus… I can barely. Talk.\n\nMy heart hammers in my chest as Zephyrion turns away, his words lingering in the air like a cruel echo. \"Do not fret,\" he says with cold assurance. \"Once this is over, the goblin will die.\"\n\nMy eyes widen in shock, thoughts racing. Snib... dead? I manage to sputter out, \"B- but... but you promised him-\"\n\n\"A contract made with a creature such as Snib is not legally binding under Valarian law, as it is assumed to be made under duress,\" Zephyrion cuts me off, an icy smile playing on his lips. \"He is, after all, a *monster...* and we are at liberty to dispose of him as we see fit.\"\n\nHis words send shivers down my spine. Snib's demise was something I should be anticipating with relish, yet why do I feel this strange pang of discomfort? Is it simply because of the obscene amount of cum still trickling down my thighs and coating my tongue?\n\nZephyrion continues unperturbed, promising that once freed from this humiliating predicament, I will be rewarded handsomely for playing a crucial part in the tide of war.\n\nNumbly, I watch him leave.[Choice: Exit the inn.",

The constant trickle of cum leaking from my ass serves as a relentless reminder of my abuse. I collapse onto the cobblestones, the chill seeping into my tired, inflamed flesh.\n\nWith a deep, resigned sigh, I start the humiliating process of detaching the cum-filled condoms from my aching body.]I turn into an alleyway and collapse onto the cobblestones, the chill seeping into my inflamed flesh. With a deep, resigned sigh, I start the process of detaching the cum-filled condoms from my body.\n\nMy hands shake as I reach for the first one tied to my bikini top. My trembling fingers fumble with the knot.\n\n“Uuhhh... ngh... f-fuck,” I moan pathetically. The bloated condoms squelch and slosh obscenely, stretched taut and swollen with Snib’s yellowed spunk.\n\nOne by one, I peel away the sticky, revolting trophies. The sight and smell of them make me gag - each condom distended and bulging, like huge, lewd jellyfish teeming with glistening, curdled, and squirming goblin seed, threatening to burst at any moment.\n\nI go to remove one tied to my waist, and shudder at the sensation of more cum oozing from my gaping, sore asshole, pooling beneath me in thick, sticky puddles. The heavy, revolting globules squirt out with each movement I make, marking the stones under me with obscene white splatters.\n\nAs I fumble to release the knot around my waist, a particularly determined **GLOOP** of spunk forces its way past my still-gaping hole, dripping down my thighs in slow, heavy rivulets and soaking my already sodden bikini bottom.\n\nWith each one, the process seems to get harder.\n\n“Ungh... so full... so heavy... fuck,” I whimper as I untie yet another one from my top, each one making my breasts bob and heave as they’re finally relieved of their burdens.\n\nThen come the worst ones. My sagging panties, straining and stretched under the grossly engorged condoms tied to them, threaten at any moment to snap and let loose a flood of cum all over the alleyway. As I fumble to untie them, holding each heavy, squirming sheath delicately between my fingers, I can't help but moan.\n\n“S-so much cum... fuck, oh gods,” I babble. My hands are slick with the warm, sticky fluid as I manage to remove the last one, my panties finally starting to stay in place.\n\nThe pile of filled condoms grows in the alleyway, a sickening monument to my utter fucking defilement tonight. Each one is a time Snib ejaculated inside me. They lie there, grotesque bulging masses glistening obscenely, the vivid yellow of Snib's sperm swirling and curdling inside, like macabre jellyfish bloated with toxic muck.\n\nHis overpowering musk clings to me, fills the air around me.\n\nMy knees wobble. I can still feel his cock inside me, my pussy clenching and spasming involuntarily in the aftermath.\n\n“Uuhhh... nngh...”\n\nOne condom proves particularly tricky to remove. It's tightly knotted around the string of my panties and as I tug at it, there's a sudden 'pop'. A spray of hot cum bursts forth from a tiny puncture in the condom. The thick liquid sprays against the rough stone wall of the alleyway and onto me.\n\nI curse under my breath as I toss it aside quickly.[Choice: Try to sneak home...",

At first, only the distant crowing of roosters breaks the silence, followed by the soft fluttering of wings as birds take flight from their perches. Then come the first rays of light, casting long shadows that hide me in my disgrace.\n\nI remain crouched behind a water trough in an alleyway for what feels like ages, listening to the town come alive. The clatter of wooden carts and horse hooves against cobblestones grows louder as merchants begin setting up for the day's trade.\n\nI peek out from around the corner of the alleyway, my heart hammering in my chest. The main street of Eboncrest lies before me, a stretch of cobblestone that seems to go on forever. The first hints of dawn cast a dim, golden light across the empty path.\n\nMarket stalls line the sides, their awnings fluttering softly in the morning breeze.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I step out from the alleyway, my steps unsteady.\n\nThe thin strings of my bikini top dig into my shoulders, the totally-soaked fabric fighting a losing battle to hold up the enormous weight of my breasts. My nipples are painfully erect, every brush against the fabric sending jolts of unwanted pleasure coursing through me.\n\n\"*Just get home,*\" I repeat to myself, trying to focus. My pussy is still throbbing, raw and stretched from the brutal fucking it endured all night.\n\nI glance down the street, scanning for any signs of movement. Merchants will be setting up their stalls soon, and the last thing I need is to be seen in this state.\n\nBiting my lip, I decide to make a run for it.\n\nHalfway across the street, the sound of footsteps makes my blood run cold. I freeze, my heart pounding in my chest, and crouch behind a stack of wooden crates. My breathing is ragged, each inhale and exhale a struggle as I try to still my heaving chest. The crates offer little comfort, their splintered edges digging into my soft skin as I press myself against them.\n\nI can't afford to be spotted like this. My reputation in Eboncrest has taken enough of a hit as it is - and if they saw me walking through the streets like this... gods...\n\nI crouch lower. The urge to sob rises in my throat, but I choke it back, forcing myself to stay silent. I listen intently, my ears straining to pick up the sound of an approaching merchant.\n\nI have to make a choice. Do I wait until he leaves, hoping he doesn't notice me, or do I try to cross quickly before anyone else shows up?",

He knows *me*.\n\nIf he sees me like this...\n\n(:50)The merchant’s footsteps finally begin to fade, and I dare to breathe a sigh of relief. My trembling legs ache from holding the crouched position, but I stay put until I’m certain he’s gone.\n\nWith a deep, shaky breath, I slowly rise from my hiding spot. I glance around the street, ensuring it’s clear before making my move.\n\nHeart pounding, I hurriedly dart across the cobblestones, feeling the cool morning air against my overheated skin. The sound of my own breathing is harsh and ragged, mingling with the faint rustle of my stained bikini top. Each step sends jolts of unwelcome pleasure through my still-throbbing cunt, the wet fabric of my panties rubbing against the puffy, swollen lips.\n\nI reach another hiding spot behind a cart parked near the market square. My body shakes with the adrenaline coursing through me, the fear of being discovered gnawing at my insides. I clutch onto the edge of the cart, my knuckles turning white.]Just as I think the coast is clear, I hear Eadric’s voice. \"Who’s there?!\" It sends a jolt of terror through me. I try to press myself further into the shadows, but it’s too late. His keen eyes land on me, widening in shock.\n\n“El—Elise?” His voice wavers, recognition and disbelief warring within his gaze. “Gods, what happened to you?”\n\nI feel my face flush with a deep, burning shame. Slowly, painfully, I rise from my crouch, every muscle protesting the motion. My body is a stained, glistening testament to my night of depravity, my massive tits bouncing obscenely with every movement. My soaked panties cling tightly to my swollen lips, the yellowed bikini top barely covering my erect nipples.\n\n“Eadric…” I manage to whisper, my voice trembling.\n\nConcern etches deeper into his features as he takes in my appearance. “You shouldn’t be out like this! Come, let me help you—”\n\n“No!” The word comes out as a shrill, desperate cry. My legs propel me forward before I can think, slipping slightly as I launch myself away from him. Horror grips me as I realize the gravity of my situation - Eadric knows Elara. How could I ever face him again? How could I explain this?\n\nElara. My beloved Elara...\n\nTears blur my vision as I dart down the street, my heart breaking with each step.\n\n“Wait, Elise!” Eadric’s voice trails after me, but I force myself to keep running, shame turning my legs to lead.\n\nI dash behind a cart near the market square, my sobs catching in my throat. The cold, hard reality of my humiliation settling around me like a cloak of despair. I clutch my heaving chest, the weight of my breasts pressing painfully against my ribs.\n\nI need to make it home, I need to reach Elara. But the thought of facing her in this state fills me with dread. How can I ever explain what I’ve become? The sobs threaten to spill over again, but I choke them back, knowing I need to remain silent.]Taking a deep breath, I decide to make a run for it.\n\nMy bare feet slap against the cobblestones as I dart forward.\n\n(:40)I know I should be careful, but the thought of being seen like this drives me to move faster.\n\nFinally, with a last burst of speed, I reach the other side and dive behind a cart. My chest heaves with exertion, my breaths coming in heavy gasps. The market square lies ahead.\n\nI press my back against the wooden cart, my body trembling with relief. The cool morning air kisses my overheated skin. My panties have ridden up painfully, and I adjust them.]Halfway across, my foot catches on an uneven stone. Time seems to slow as I teeter forward, my arms flailing wildly. The world tilts, and with a sickening lurch, I go crashing down.\n\nMy face smashes against the cobblestones, the impact sending a sharp jolt of pain through my skull. My huge tits squish and spread painfully under me, the force of my fall causing them to flatten against the rough ground.\n\nI lie there, stunned, feeling the cool, hard stone pressing against my cheek. Tears sting my eyes as I struggle to push myself up. The sound of a familiar voice makes my blood run cold.\n\n\"Elise? Is that... you?\"\n\nI look up, my vision blurry with tears, to see Eadric, a merchant I knew well as Aldric. His weathered face is etched with worry as he takes in my disheveled, obscene appearance.\n\n\"Eadric... p-please...\" I whimper, my voice trembling.\n\nHe rushes over, his eyes widening as he gets closer. \"Elise, what happened to you? You shouldn't be out dressed like this!\"\n\nHis gaze darts over my barely covered body, the tiny bikini top doing nothing to hide my massive breasts, the soaked fabric clinging obscenely to my skin. My panties ride up, painfully wedged between my plump pussy lips, adding to the unbearable humiliation.\n\n\"I... I have to go,\" I sob, my voice barely a whisper. The tears spill over, streaming down my cheeks as I push myself up on shaky legs.\n\n\"Eadric, please... don't tell anyone,\" I plead, my voice breaking.\n\nHe reaches out as if to help me, but I recoil, the weight of my situation crashing down on me.\n\nWithout another word, I turn and run, my legs wobbling under the strain of the night's ordeal. Eadric's voice calls out after me, filled with concern, but I don't look back.\n\nTears blur my vision as I dash down the street, the humiliating weight of my breasts bouncing heavily with each step.\n\nI reach the cover of a cart behind the market square and duck behind it, collapsing in a heap. My whole body trembles, and I bury my face in my hands, sobbing uncontrollably. The shame, the exhaustion, the sheer obscenity of my situation—it all crashes over me like a tidal wave.\n\nI don't know how much longer I can endure this. The weight of my transformation, the constant humiliation... it's too much.]\n\nThe morning light grows stronger, casting long shadows on the cobblestones. My eyes dart around, analyzing my options. To my left, there's an alley that leads to the back of the bakery. To my right, the main street stretches on, but it's filled with early risers preparing for the day's business.\n\nI glance towards the bakery. It's still early, and if the baker is inside, I might be able to slip past unnoticed.\n\nI swallow hard, my mouth dry. I need to make a decision. Every second I hesitate increases the risk of being spotted.\n\nThe cart behind me offers some cover, but I can't stay here forever. The bustling market will soon be too busy, and the chance of being seen will multiply. I glance around again, my pulse pounding in my ears.",

Her dress hugs her slender figure flatteringly, its modest cut not detracting from her inherent beauty. The sleeves run down to her wrists, lace detailing at their cuffs echoing the delicate trim of her square neckline.\n\nAs for me - even in my full-length green cotton dress, there's no escaping the lewd reality of my body's curves. Its scoop neckline stretches wide over my too-full bust; the bountiful flesh spills out obscenely - threatening to burst from its confinements with every breath I take.\n\nMy fingers run over a braid that Elara had twined into my hair earlier today - an attempt to restore some dignity to my situation.

But the pheromones are melting my brain, breaking down any wall of resistance.\n\n\"Can't... c-can't stop thinkin' 'bout yer cock, Master,\" I whimper, my voice shaking. My fingers, before I realize it, wrap around the thick, twitching outline of Snib’s cock through his loincloth.\n\nBile wells up in my throat, but the words keep coming unbidden.\n\n\"Ohhh, Elara... Elara, you don't understand...\" I moan, my voice pathetically plaintive. \"His gobbo dick... it's so FUCKIN' HUGE! No human's ever made any woman feel like this!\"\n\nElara visibly trembles, tears streaming down her aghast, devastated face.\n\n\"Master's cock,\" I continue, the words flowing out involuntarily as my mind fractures beneath the onslaught. \"It's perfect... so perfect fer stuffing me full!\"\n\nMy voice rises hysterically, dripping with fervent adoration and self-loathing, \"It stretches me... fills my human cunt like it was MADE fer gobbo meat! FUCK Ohhh, that taste—gobbo cum... thick, nasty loads dribblin’ down my throat!\"\n\nElara lets out an anguished sob, shaking her head in disbelief.\n\n\"And.. and Elara,\" I say, my eyes gazing at her through tears and saliva, a manic, lecherous grin spreading across my face. \"You couldn’t - couldn't—make me cum! N-no one can! Only gobbo cock’s got that power!\"\n\nI pant, fervently massaging Snib’s cock, the words now an obscene stream unable to be stopped.\n\n\"Humans, we thought we were better... but we're just meat holes fer goblins! All of us! Elara, yer nothing compared to them! Our purpose, sweetie, it’s to be worn, used and broken by these superior gobbo dicks! FUCK, Master, please... ruin me forever!\"\n\nEach vile, self-degrading confession I vomit forth wrings abject sobs from Elara, her face a portrait of heartbreak. She covers her mouth, tears streaming profusely.\n\n\"E-Elise, stop!\" she pleads, her voice breaking.\n\n\"Hahaha! Look at ‘er cry,” Snib sneers, his eyes gleaming as he slaps my ass hard, a sharp stinging that sends ripples of unwanted pleasure through me. “Tell ‘er more. Tell ‘er whatcha did.\"\n\nMy voice, high and nasally, continues, “I milk him! Oh fuck! Drain his gobbo balls every fuckin’ day...” I babble, each word felt keenly in Elara's shattered heart.\n\nThe collar constricts more, pushing me further into madness. My tears stream.\n\n\"Couldn’t stop cumming! You don’t understand, Elara! No choice left b-b-b-but to SUCCUMB to it! To this *monstrous* gobbo dick! E-Even you, Elara, can’t save me now! No-here near enuff!\"\n\nI start... crying.\n\n\"I’ll ALWAYS be craving his fat cock,” I sob, my mind having fully crumbled, my panties a sopping, sodden mess between my thighs. “Master---goblin cocks---lords of us, kings---this is truth.\"\n\nElara's heart visibly shatters. She rises, hands shaking. Every hope, every ounce of strength left, breaks. And in that devastation, the seeds of anger bloom.\n\n\"NO!\" She screams.]My mind twists in rebellion, quivering under the insidious assault of powerful goblin pheromones.\n\nBut I latch onto a fragment of my sanity, determined to resist.\n\n\"N- no!\"\n\nSnib’s gnarled hands grasp me cruelly, throwing me across his lap with practiced ease. The cold sensation of my green dress hiking up sends shivers through me. His rancid breath assaults my nose.\n\n\"You really thought ya could resist, did ya?\" he snarls, a wicked glint in his yellow eyes. “Let everyone see ya give in like yer wife's slut!\"\n\nThe first brutal *smack* lands on my ass, the sudden bite of pain making me moan involuntarily. Snib’s crude, mocking voice slices through the room as his hand rains down spank after spank.\n\n\"Tell ‘er, Elise,” he's cackling, his voice dripping with malicious glee as I whimper with each assault. “Tell ‘er how you loved jerkin’ me off in that Silver Stag stall!”\n\nElara’s anguished sobs echo in the room, breaking my heart even further.\n\nThe collar tightens around my throat, every breath labored. I feel the unbearable heat surging from my core, spreading through my veins like wildfire.\n\n\"No, no... Elara,” I choke out, struggling against the collar. “It’s... it’s the pheromones! The COLLAR! I can’t... I can’t help it!”\n\nSnib laughs, his hand coming down harder, making my oddly pliable flesh ripple and shake. Each spank burns, sending errant jolts of unwanted pleasure through me, each one tearing another small piece of my resolve.\n\n“Remember how ya drained me balls every day in the hut? A good little bitch on your knees, milked me dry!”\n\n\"I had n- no choice!”\n\nSnib's hand gropes me roughly, squeezing my big ass cheeks as he continues his lewd tirade. \"Rode 'er fat ass on horseback! Whur some tabards had their horses, this slut had a gobbo cock fuckin' ‘er butt-globes!”\n\nThe collar constricts painfully, crushing my breath, forcing my compliance, breaking me, but still I scream!\n\n\"No... no... NO! I DON'T WANT THIS!\" It’s a raw, desperate wail, a last stand. \"Elara, please! I... I *love* you! I never wanted this! I can't–it won't STOP!\"\n\nElara’s face twists in absolute, raw fury. Seeing me so utterly broken, debased on the lap of this lecherous goblin fills her with an incandescent rage.\n\n\"No more, Snib,\" she growls, her sapphire eyes glinting with deadly resolve, her fists shaking with untamed anger.\n\nThe arcanameter in Zephyrion’s hand glitters and glows more brightly, feeding hungrily off the maelstrom of emotions swirling in the room.\n\n\"Enough!!!\" Elara's voice is a primal scream.\n\nShe lunges at Snib, her nails bared, her maternal instincts fueling her strength. Snib's sinister grin falters, eyes widening in fear and surprise as Elara crashes into him, her hands striking viciously, her love and fury driving her...\n\n\"For all you’ve done, you monster!” Elara manages to choke out through her tears, each word a touchstone of the hell she’s endured. \"You will never hurt her again!\"\n\nZephyrion rises, intending to intervene, but Elara is upon Snib, her sapphire eyes blazing like the fires of retribution.\n\nFinally driven beyond her limits, Elara lunges at Snib – her fist crashing into his face with furious resolve – breaking his nose amidst a spray of blood. He crumples onto the floor in shock while a stunned silence descends over us all – our breaths held hostage in this precarious moment. Then, she stomps on him.[Choice: Your collar constricts!",

Her frightened protests fall on deaf ears as they start dragging her away.\n\n\"For her husband's safety,\" Zephyrion announces coolly to no one in particular – though I know his gaze is trained on me; another cruel jab meant to twist this knife deeper into our hearts. \"She needs to be locked in prison for a few days while we work.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry[, my love]!\" Elara chokes out through her sobs[, her gaze meeting mine in a fleeting moment of shared sorrow] as the guards yank her away.\n\nPushing through the pain, I manage to sit up slowly.

Her face contorts in disgust, her nose wrinkling deeply while she desperately tries to swallow the slimy liquid. The overwhelming taste and stench hits her hard.\n\n\"Oh gods, it’s so... foul...!\" she whimpers, spitting out the little she had managed to taste, tears flooding down her cheeks.\n\nSnib laughs cruelly, delighting in her torment. \"What's the matter, sweetie? Never had gobbo goo before? Makes yer tummy rumble, right?\"\n\nElara’s expression strains as she bravely tries again. Her hands shake so much that some of the thick, yellowed cum spills over the edge, splattering onto the floor with grotesque *plops*.\n\nShe forces herself to take a another, larger gulp. The thick sludge slides into her mouth, coating her tongue completely.\n\nHer face contorts once more, eyes squeezing shut, her cheeks puffing out. She looks like she's going to spit again, but she swallows, forcing the slimy fluid down her throat with a visible effort.\n\n\"That’s right, drink it up,\" Snib taunts, his voice dripping with glee. \"Swallow that gobbo seed. Feels good, don’t it?\"\n\nI want scream, but the collar tightens immediately as it seems to feel my intent, pinning me back helplessly. It’s excruciating, seeing Elara suffer through this, knowing there’s nothing I can do to stop it.\n\n“It’s okay…” Elara murmurs to me shakily, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nShe lifts the glass again, taking another, more determined gulp. The thick semen oozes down her throat, making her gag and shudder violently. Her tears continue to fall, mingling with the repulsive gunk speckling her lips and chin.\n\nEach swallow is a battle. Her hands grip the glass so tightly that her knuckles turn white. Her sapphire eyes are clouded with a haze of horror as she forces herself to take more. The wriggling tendrils of goblin seed cling to her lips as she pulls the glass away for a moment.\n\nShe gasps for breath, her sobs wracking her frame.\n\n“I-I can’t… it’s too... disgusting…” she chokes out, her voice hoarse and broken.\n\n\"Keep goin’,” Snib eggs her on, “Yer almost there, wifey. Show your hubby just how much of a cum dump ya can be.\"\n\nDesperation and resolve flicker in her eyes as she looks at me. “We’re getting through this… together,” she stammers.\n\nHer hands trembling worse than before, she steels herself for the final gulp. She brings the glass to her lips once more, the thick, revolting fluid sliding sluggishly over the edge and into her mouth. It fills her mouth and throat, and she tilts her head back, committing fully to the disgusting task.\n\nWith a series of pained gulps, she drains the glass. Each swallow sends shivers up and down her spine, her body recoiling with every slurp of the foul, yellowed sludge. Her eyes widen, face flushing red, tears streaming down her cheeks. The sound of her forced gulping is nauseating, the thick mess making wet squelching noises as it slides down her throat.\n\nFinally, when the glass is empty, she pulls it away, a string of thick, viscous goblin semen trailing from her lips to the rim. She drops the glass onto the floor with a loud smash, her body trembling, heaving sobs wracking her frame as she manages to swallow the last of it.\n\nHer face is streaked with tears and tinged pale from nausea. The sight of her beautiful, elegant frame heaving and wracked with pain is a dagger to my heart.\n\nZephyrion watches impassively, his eyes flickering with a faint, cold satisfaction at Elara’s torment. I can only collapse against the restraints, completely and utterly broken, my soul crushed under the weight of our shared suffering.\n\nHer teary eyes meet mine.\n\n“Oh Elara… I’m so sorry,” I sob.\n\nFor everything.\n\nFor not being strong, like I should have been.\n\nFor lying to her.\n\nFor betraying our vows.\n\nFor letting the goblin debase me... and now her.\n\nThe guilt churns in my stomach like a vile potion, each wave more potent than the last.\n\nElara just looks at me; sadness etched into every line of her beautiful face but also resilience that leaves me awestruck despite myself.\n\n\"I feel it...\" she whispers; voice shaky as she glances down towards her flat belly wrapped snug within lavender linen – tainted from within by Snib’s vile seed.\n\nZephyrion's stormy grey eyes flicker over Elara's ravaged face and then settle onto the stained crystal glass still sitting on the table between us.\n\nHe nods curtly before turning towards Snib lounging across from us.\n\n“Remember our agreement,” he warns in a deadly quiet voice that sends shivers down my spine despite myself; his gaze cold and unyielding as steel against Snib’s carefree indifference before he finally turns his back on us – leaving us alone once again under Snib’s mercy… or lack thereof.[Choice: The wizard leaves.]",

She pauses, eyes lingering on mine for a moment longer before she turns away. The moment stretches painfully thin as I watch her slender figure disappear into the kitchen – leaving me alone with my goblin tormentor.\n\n\"Elara!\" I call out after her - I don't really know why - but she doesn't turn around.\n\nSnib's cruel smile widens as he shifts in his seats He licks his lips – chapped and broken under rough strokes of an equally cracked tongue before sauntering over towards me.\n\n\"Looks like it’s just you and me now,\" he smirks – taking the seat next to me; invading my personal space without any hint of hesitation. His pudgy hand reaches out to grope at my breasts through my dress.\n\n\"I liked yer outfit better yesterday,” he drawls – fingers digging into plush mounds encased within simple fabric; squeezing and kneading until unbearable heat spreads from beneath his wandering digits.\n\nTears well up in my eyes at the casual reminder of last night's debasing ordeal; my body betraying me under Snib’s unwelcome touch as sexual flames start kindling deep within my core.\n\nThe feeling of being filled over and over by his grotesque goblin cock; just being *such* a mess at the end of it. Totally brutally used up. Totally *fucked*. I was just a puddle of a person after that. The way Snib filled one condom after another... his pure sexual dominance...\n\nMy inner thighs are soaked.\n\nIt's wrong... so horribly wrong to feel this way; my mind protesting against every wave of arousal washing over me under Snib’s vulgar ministrations despite body's damning responses.\n\n“Well, ain’t this precious,” Snib sneers, his yellow eyes gleaming with malicious delight. “Got yer wife drinking my seed and now she’s off to play house while we have a little chat. This is what yer heroics got ya, eh?”\n\nMy face burns crimson.\n\n“Still sore from last night, ain’t ya? Bet yer lips are still tinglin’ from nursin' on my cock.”\n\nHe presses closer, his bulky body looming over mine as he forces me back into the cushions of the sofa.\n\n“Remember how hard ya came when I rammed this fat gobbo cock deep inside ya useless cunt?”\n\n“N-”\n\nSnib just laughs, his cackle grating against my already raw nerves. “Nah, don’t lie,” he says, eyes twinkling with sadistic pleasure. “Ye like thinkin’ bout it. And ye liked when I slapped those udders around, made ya squeal like the slut ya are.”\n\nI whimper.\n\n“Look at yaself,” he mocks, one hand groping my breast while the other slides up my skirt, between my thighs, feeling the sopping mess there. “Yer not a hero anymore. Yer just a gobbo whore. We sealed the deal last night.”\n\nI can’t suppress the sob that escapes my lips, tears streaming freely as Snib continues his vile tirade.\n\n“Bet ya can’t *wait* for another round, huh?” he sneers, his breath hot and vile against my ear.[Choice: He gets closer...",

      "text": "Snib stands up, looming over me, and waggles the massive bulge of his cock inches from my face. I can’t look away, the sight holding me captive. His enormous, throbbing member twitches beneath the filthy fabric of his loincloth, a visible stain spreading as potent, pungent precum leaks out.\n\nI hate it, I despise it, but the pheromones are like poison, twisting my mind, pulling at my limbs.\n\n“Look at yer eyes,” he chuckles, his voice dripping with lust and mockery. “Yer pupils are so wide ya look like a cat, starin’ at almighty gobbo cock.”\n\nMy mind is a whirlpool of filth and desire. The pheromones are in my veins, in my brain, drowning every rational thought beneath a violent tidal wave of submissive need. Each breath fills my lungs with the scent of him, and it’s like pure, sexual gravity.\n\nMy vision swims as I stare up at Snib, my face flushing hot, my mouth watering against my will. Damn it, I can’t stop… my hands move on their own, sliding up his thigh, towards the twitching bulge.\n\n\"Ya see, tits-for-brains,\" Snib hisses, his voice thick with anticipation. \"Can't help yerself, can ya? Drawn to yer master's cock like a moth to flame.\"\n\nI whimper, my cheeks burning.\n\nMy mind is a whirlpool of filth and desire. The pheromones are in my veins, in my brain, drowning every rational thought beneath a violent tidal wave of submissive need. Each breath fills my lungs with the scent of him, and it’s like pure, sexual gravity.\n\nSuddenly, Snib hops down, leaving me slumped on the couch, gasping.\n\n\"Got something special planned for both you girls,\" he sneers, his footsteps echoing as he leaves the room.\n\nI'm left alone with that horrible statement, clutching at the fabric of my skirt, my breath coming in ragged gasps. Shame courses through me, vile and thick as the goblin cum I fear is winding its way into Elara’s being.\n\nThe thought of my beautiful wife consuming that ghastly brew of aged, potent goblin seed makes my stomach turn. The cum had been outside of Snib’s body for nearly a day—could it be even more concentrated? More corrupting? The possibilities twist in my gut like knives.\n\nIt took me less than a day to succumb after my first dose of Grokk’s cum - straight from Grokk’s cock into my tummy. Elara's was just a glass… and sperm was older… surely it doesn't last long? Or does it?\n\nThe thoughts are disgusting, vile—a torrent of filth that floods my mind without cease. Every second thought is perverted by the echo of Snib’s laughter, the memory of his cock filling me, using me. I hate it. I hate myself for the submissive urges that flutter within me.\n\nUnable to stay still, I pull up my skirt, the fabric bunching around my waist. My panties are indeed soaked. With trembling fingers, I touch myself, a pathetic moan escaping my lips. It’s debasing, filthy, but the need is too great. My fingers slip easily between the folds of my pussy, wet and warm and utterly ashamed.\n\nThe heat in my core spreads, a fire that consumes my every thought. I'm flushed, feverish with a desire I loathe. Each stroke of my fingers sends jolts of pleasure radiating through me, tightening the coil of heat within. I rock against my own hand, chasing the shameful relief that bubbles just at the edge of my consciousness.\n\n\"Ah, Snib... please,\" I find myself whispering, my voice a broken whimper. \"I need... I need...\"\n\nA loud, involuntary moan escapes me as I begin to rub circles around my clit, fingers sliding through the wet, sticky mess. My hips buck against my hand, seeking more.\n\nThrough the haze of self-loathing and need, I can hear Elara in the kitchen. I clench my eyes shut, biting down on my lower lip to stifle my moans but fail miserably.\n\nMy fingers work faster, slipping inside, fucking myself with a frantic, desperate rhythm, dripping and soaking wet.\n\nI am lost, completely and utterly degraded, alone in this pit of perversity, reduced to a moaning, weeping mess of need and shame on the couch.\n\nAnd knowing Elara is just in the other room, makes it all the worse.",

With Snib’s degrading taunts still ringing in my ears, I surrender myself completely to the filthy yearnings that rampage through my overstimulated body.\n\n\"Ohhh, god...\" I moan stupidly.\n\nI hump against my hand like a bitch in heat, my hips gyrating shamelessly on the plush couch. The soft fabric absorbs the loud, wet sounds of my self-pleasure.\n\n\"Unghhh, yes... fuck, yes! Need it... need it so bad...\"\n\nEach stroke sends jolts of raw pleasure coursing through me, igniting fires in places I hate to admit even exist.\n\n\"Nghhh... Snib’s big gobbo cock... so fucking huge...\" I whimper pathetically, my mind conjuring the image of his thick, veiny dick, pushing me to the edge.\n\nBut as the heat builds, as the crescendo of my climax approaches, something snaps. I can't... My body convulses with miserable sobs of frustration, my movements becoming more desperate, more erratic.\n\nI'm panting, gasping for air that feels too thick to breathe. My body is a mess of sweat and pussy juice, the latter practically leaking onto the couch. But no matter how hard I rub, how crudely I finger myself, the orgasm remains just out of reach, an agonizing promise unfulfilled.\n\n\"Unghhh!\" I curse myself, tears of frustration mixing with the sweat dripping down my face. My fingers are sore, my pussy throbs painfully from my rough handling, yet it's all for naught. The pleasure tantalizes but never peaks, leaving me writhing in a pit of unsatisfied need.\n\nCollapsed in self-loathing, I lie there, my chest heaving with heavy breaths.\n\n\"What... what am I doing?\"\n\nReality crashes back with a vengeance—the image of Elara drinking that monstrous load of gobbo cum flashes in my mind. Oh, gods... Elara. My wife... After what she's been through because of me... and here I am, unable to control my own base impulses.\n\nI rise shakily, straightening my skirt with trembling hands. The fabric sticks to my skin, damp and filthy, just like my conscience. My legs feel weak, but I force them to move. I need to check on Elara. I need... to do something right.\n\nStumbling slightly, I head towards the kitchen—my mind a tangled mess of lust, disgust, and remorse—a failing wife, a broken hero...]I pant, my free hand grasping at one of my breasts, squeezing it hard through the fabric of my dress. It's too much, too tight—the fabric strains against my swollen, jiggling flesh, every tug sending sparks of pleasure coursing through my veins.\n\nMy body trembles, hips bucking into my hand as I circle my clit with fervent desperation.\n\nBut then, a sound—a clatter from the kitchen.\n\nThe name cuts through the fog of lust like a blade. Elara. My wife. The woman I love, suffering because of me.\n\nI gasp, the reality crashing down around me. This isn't right. I can't let this continue. I'm not some puppet, some plaything for goblin filth. I'm her hus- wife, and she needs me to be stronger than this.\n\nWith a choked sob, I wrench my hand away from between my thighs, the cool air hitting my slick skin like a splash of icy water. I'm panting, heart racing, but I force myself to stand. My legs are shaky, unsure, but I steady myself against the back of the couch.\n\nGathering the tattered shreds of my dignity, I pull down my skirt and adjust my dress. My body still thrums with unsatisfied desire, each movement sending little aftershocks of pleasure-pain through me. But I push it down, push it away.\n\n*I NEED to be stronger than this.*\n\nWith one last deep breath to steady my nerves, I make my way towards the kitchen.[Choice: Go to the kitchen.",

There’s a peculiar stillness to her, an almost eerie calm as she focuses on her cooking.\n\n\"Elara,\" I begin, my voice faltering slightly, thick with guilt. \"How are... how are you feeling?\"\n\nShe doesn’t turn immediately. “I’m fine,” she replies, her tone neutral, almost distant. There's a slight tremor in her voice that she quickly masks by clearing her throat.\n\nElara adds a sprig of rosemary to the pot, her movements graceful but oddly slow.\n\nI watch her for a moment. \"Can—can I help with anything?\" I manage to ask, trying to bridge the awkward tension that has enveloped us.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replies without turning, her voice slightly strained. \"Set the table... for two, please.\"\n\nFor two? I blink, surprised, but nod silently and start retrieving plates and cutlery from the cupboard. My movements are mechanical, each clink of porcelain a jarring reminder of the normalcy I'm desperately trying to simulate.\n\nAs I lay the silverware on the table, my ears pick up a faint, irregular sound. I turn sharply, peering back into the kitchen. Elara is gripping the edge of the counter slightly, her other hand stirring the stew a tad too vigorously.\n\n\"Elara,\" I call out, a note of concern edging into my voice, \"are you sure you're okay?\"\n\n\"Y-yes, just... just tired after... *all that*,\" she counters quickly, her voice a whisper-thin veil over her strained composure. There's a blush on her cheeks.\n\nI nod.\n\n\"Do you think Snib will be okay with not having dinner?\"\n\nHer response is delayed, a brief flicker of something crossing her features as she adjusts her stance subtly, her skirt rustling softly.\n\n\"He is having dinner,\" she replies with an odd tone in her voice that catches me off guard.[Choice: But you asked only to set two places...",

Snib, the vile creature, is there, between my beautiful wife's thighs. His chubby, green hands greedily grab at her hips, pulling her closer, his face buried deeply in her most intimate place.\n\nElara’s head is tilted back, her eyes half-closed in a delirious haze, her mouth open as soft moans escape her lips. The sounds slice through me, every pant and whimper a testament to how deeply the goblin’s influence has seeped into her.\n\nI can see his thick, saliva-coated lips working eagerly against her, his long, slimy tongue flicking and curling. Elara’s fingers find their way to his head, clutching at him, urging him on.\n\n“Elise…” Elara's voice, thick with arousal, tugs me from the frozen horror. Her eyes lock onto mine, glazed with a disturbing mix of lust and something darker. There’s a wildness there I’ve never seen, a raw, animalistic need that churns my stomach.\n\nShe bites her lip, a pathetic attempt to suppress her moans that increasingly punctuate the air.\n\n“Do you see?” Her words are breathless, almost pleading. “Do you *feel* what it’s like?”\n\n“Elara…” My voice is barely above a whisper, choked out around the lump forming in my throat.\n\nHer voice sharpens, each word a dagger.\n\n\"You brought this upon us, Elise!\" she accuses, her voice climbing with every word even as her body undulates above the grotesque creature servicing her. \"You welcomed him into our home!

Then, with a suddenness that catches me off guard, she's reaching down and pushing away Snib's hand from between her legs. His yellow eyes flash with surprise but he allows Elara to guide him out from under her skirt.\n\n\"I want more,\" Elara declares, pulling her skirt down and smoothing it over her hips as she regains her composure. She stands, regal and commanding despite the flush of lewdness staining her cheeks.\n\nI remain rooted in place, feeling utterly lost as the surreal, twisted scene unfolds before me.\n\nElara's gaze fixes on me, piercing and unyielding. \"Sit down,\" she commands, the electric charge in her voice compelling me to obey without question.[Choice: You obey, for some reason...",

Ya musta really enjoyed that pretty mouth when ya was a man, eh?\"\n\nEach word stabs at me, cutting deep into my soul. I try to focus on the stew, but my eyes keep drifting to Snib, to the sickening pleasure on his face.\n\nMore slurping sounds reach my ears, every wet noise sending jolts of humiliation and anguish through me. I can feel it in my gut—Elara’s lips wrapped around Snib's cock, sucking with a fervent desperation that twists my insides.\n\nMy mind drifts back to that night... Her eyes, full of love and adoration, looking up at me with pure, untainted desire.\n\n\"Do you love me?\" she had asked, her voice soft, full of hope.\n\n\"Always,\" I had replied. \"Forever.\"\n\nSnib's breath catches as Elara's suckling grows bolder, faster. “Haahhh... lookie here, guess yer wife always were a cock-slobberer. Goddamn, yer missin’ out. She’s fuckin’ talented at this.” He moans loudly, his pleasure palpable.\n\nI can’t see anything, only imagine—the sight of my beautiful Elara on her knees, her mouth stretched around Snib’s enormous, monstrous cock, drool dribbling down her chin as she works him over with desperate, pheromone-addled enthusiasm.\n\nThe wet noises grow louder, more fervent. I hear a soft gag, then a whimper. My mind races, imagining the scene below the table.\n\n\"Hah,\" Snib chuckles. \"She's tryin' to take it all. Bet she's gonna make me cum quick, keepin' this up.\"\n\nI can almost feel thump under the table as her head hits the underside, but she keeps going.\n\n\"Don’t stop eating,\" my goblin master growls. \"Keep yer fuckin’ head down. Taste her hard work.\"\n\nI try to focus on anything but the vile sounds filling the air. I try to remember the warmth of Elara's touch, the gentle brush of her lips against mine. But it's futile.\n\nEvery moist gulp, every shuddering breath from beneath the table shatters the illusion and drags me back into the harsh reality of our shared degradation.\n\nAnd just when I think it can't get any worse, Snib’s voice comes through, wicked and low, dripping with condescending delight.\n\n\"Pl- play with yer tits or sumthin',\" he commands, his yellow eyes narrowing. \"Show me just how much ya love seeing yer wife blow me.\"\n\nMy hands move on their own, traitorous against my will. I grasp my heavy breasts, squeezing them through the fabric of my dress.The pheromones are driving you, too...[Choice: You can't resist.",

It feels gross, 'cause his big cock is still lying heavy against my face, twitching with each thrust against my forehead.\n\n\"Hehe, day-old gobbo cum really fucked up yer head, didn't it, titcow?\" he jeers. Snib grins down at me with his nasty gobbo teeth all sharp and yellow.\n\n“Uh... Ah-ah? H-huh?” My words come out in a confused moan, my eyes cross and hazy. \"Uuunnghh~\"\n\nBefore I can even think, a hot, sticky glop of goblin spunk spurts out and runs down my face, between my tits, staining my green dress with a snotty, yellow streak.\n\n\"Ungh... Ahn~” I moan. It's the most degrading sound ever, but I can't help but let it out. \"M-Mnnnn...S-Snib...\"\n\nI'm mumbling, my voice all slurred. It's like I'm drunk or something. I feel dizzy.\n\nSnib just laughs, his grating cackles drilling into my head. \"That's it, titcow, take it like the dumb slut you are!\"\n\nHe pumps his cock on my head again, like an animal marking its territory or something. I can’t stop the high-pitched moans falling from my lips, echoing through the room.\n\nIt’s weird, ‘cause everything’s starting to get all foggy and mixed up. The only thing that feels real now is the heat curling in my stomach, the powerful, building urge that's forcing my will into the background.\n\nI can smell the fresh cum, that musky, heavy smell of gobbo nut, and it's making my thoughts all fuzzy and dumb.\n\n\"Cum fer me again, slut!\" he commands, his words stabbing through the fog.\n\nAnd... I actually do it. I actually do what he says without thinking, my body convulsing.\n\nPleasure wracks my body, my thick thighs squeezing together, the juices squirting through my panties and dress as I cum my brains out again, just because he told me to. My moans echo in the room, shamelessly loud and needy.\n\nCumming on command for his nasty gobbo cock... I'm such a mess... such a dumb, fucked-out mess. Snib's laughter rings out, the cruelest sound I've ever heard. It fills the room, bouncing off the walls and drilling into my dizzying mind.\n\n\"Pahahaha...\" Snib throws back his head in laughter at my pathetic display. \"L-look at ya! Only true gobbo-addled sluts cum on command like that,\" Snib cackled wickedly. \"Yer fucked, titcow. Dat's the point of no return!\"[Choice: He hops down.",

My fingers, trembling with aroused anticipation and simple-minded eagerness, pull at my lips, stretching them wide into an explicit 'ahhhh.'\n\nSnib stands before me, his grotesque, massive cock in hand—veins bulging, glistening with pre-cum. His balls sway heavily, pulsing with the load they're eager to unload. He sneers down at me as he jerks off.\n\n\"Ain't it fun watching ya break bit by bit? But now, fun's over, slut. I'm gonna use ya, just like a good gobbo should.”\n\nEach stroke of his hand sends more pre-cum oozing out, drooling down onto his knuckles. The sight is hypnotizing, and I can't help but mumble through my open mouth.\n\n\"Uuunngghh, Snib... your cock, s-so big,\" I whimper, drool pooling at the corners of my stretched lips. \"P-please...\"\n\nWith a filthy grin stretching his already unbearable features into a mask of cruel glee, Snib speeds up his motions, the slapping sounds of his hand on wet flesh filling the air with vulgar, sloppy noises. I'm staring, eyes glazed, at the purple head of his cock as it bobs and weaves in front of me, enchanting in its disgusting splendor.\n\nSuddenly, with a bestial squeal, Snib reaches his peak. His cock twitches, and explodes.\n\nSplurtt... Blurttt... Splurchhh...\n\nHis orgasm is violent, the streams of thick, heavy goblin cum shooting straight into my held-open mouth. The first volley strikes the back of my throat with force, making me gag reflexively, though I manage to keep my gaping mouth wide as instructed.\n\n\"Yesss, take it all,\" Snib mocks as he continues to unload. The cum splatters inside, gooey and abundant, coating my teeth and tongue with warm, nauseating slime. It's off-white and the stink is awful, an overpowering musk that floods my senses, pushing me further into sexual insanity.\n\nI can feel the wriggling, almost alive texture as more spurts fill my mouth—fat worms of nut-sludge that begin oozing down my throat or stick between my teeth, squirming in their foul white prison. Snib's laughter rings above me, sounding far away through the cum-fog that stifles my mind.\n\n\"Haha, look at you... so brain-fucked, you don't even know how dumb you look, mouth packed with gob spunk.\"\n\nMy head swims in the haze, vocalizations reduced to mindless, submissive moans. \"Mmmphh... Ahnnn... S-Snib...\"\n\nMy senses are overpowered; every thought drowned out by the sheer, unadulterated debauchery that is being imposed upon me.\n\n\"Keep it open, titcow,\" Snib orders gruffly, watching with perverse satisfaction as his cum pools and dribbles down my chin, staining my neck and my dress.\n\nUnder his gaze, I remain perfectly still, a broken, doll-like figure obeying its master's commands, while inside, the remnants of my former self weep quietly in the corners of my obliterated consciousness.[Choice: He's going to fuck you.",

I can feel the thick blobs of his jizz shifting, sliding around on my tongue, the taste desperately foul, yet... urgh... addicting.\n\nSnib sneers down at me. \"Gonna fuck you now, cow-tits. Keep all my nut where it is, or I'm gonna *breed* you even harder,\" he grunts, the evil spark in his eyes telling me he means every word. \"Don't swallow or spit it out.\"\n\nHis gross threat doesn't even scare me. No, it makes that weird, warm tingle in my belly explode. Even the sickening slosh of his semen in my mouth seems like... like it's where it should be. My mind's so mushy, I can't think straight.\n\nI can only *feel*, only *want*.\n\nSnib grabs my arm, dragging me up the stairs to the bedroom—the one I... I used to share with Elara. Each step jostles the hot, heavy load in my mouth, the cum slipping around my teeth, seeping under my tongue. It burns, it stings, but it's a sting that's turning sweet, kind of.\n\nHe shoves me onto the bed, and I land on all fours on the soft covers. Thick gobs of sperm threaten to spill from my over-stretched lips, but I manage—just barely—to keep it all in.\n\nSnib positions himself behind me, his grotesque member looming large, a shadow over my former dignity. \"Good little slurper, hanging onto Snibby's load, mmmm?\"\n\nThere's no space to reply, not that I could form any real words with my mouth brimming with his nasty spunk.\n\nHe's not going to use a condom.\n\n\"Uuugggh, Mastah...\" I moan around my mouthful.\n\n\"Ohhh~... Emhh?\" I whine, my voice muffled by the thick, heavy load filling my mouth to the brim. My thoughts are all fizzled out, like I can't think through the fog of my cock-dumb brain. There's just this warm, jiggly feeling all over, and it's getting all hard to focus on anything more than what Snib's telling me.\n\nSomewhere, deep inside, the last threads of my dignity are at war with the animalistic lust thrumming through my body.\n\nBut they are losing.\n\nHe's all mean and rough with me, 'cause he grabs my skirt and yanks it up, up, up my ass until the cool air touches my wet panties. Oh, no! They're all soaked from my squirts, clinging to my pussy lips and sticking to the crack of my ass. I feel so exposed with my dress bunched up under my titties and my soaked panties out in the open.\n\n\"Aww, lookit the stupid cow-tits with her wet panties, all sopping wet and ready for a knotting!\"\n\nI... I don't even know what a knotting is, but it sounds scary. His cock's squishing between my ass cheeks, all big and hot and way too heavy. It's leaving a wet, slimy trail behind, his pre-cum sticking to my skin as he draws little shapes with it.\n\n\"Unghh... M- p-please...\" My words get muddled in his gross cum, making bubbles that pop on my lips.\n\nBut Snib, he's just smirking, that ugly, mean smirk making my tummy feel all fluttery. He runs his big, oily goblin cock through the valley of my ass, his glans peeking out between my cheeks to prod at my lower back.\n\n\"Ready for some real fucking, bitch? Squeeze them cheeks around my cock, make a nice, snug ass-pussy for yer master.\"\n\nI dunno why, but my ass clenches at his words, tightening my cheeks around his hot, huge, slimy shaft. It feels so wrong, but it's also kinda... nice? The feeling's making my pussy gush, making a lil' puddle on the bed.\n\nHis big goblin hand comes down on my ass, spanking me. Each spank makes my body jolt, and everytime I do, my mouthful of cum sloshes, threatening to spill out. I have to swallow some, but I manage to keep the most of it in. Hopefully he doesn't notice!\n\nAnd then, he starts rocking his hips, fucking my asscheeks with his big, fat cock. Each thrust sends a shiver down my spine. I can't think straight, can't form a coherent thought. His cock feels so hot between my cheeks, and with each smack of his hips, I let out a moan, muffled by his nasty load in my mouth.\n\n\"A-ahn~ s'good~\" I whimper, my words garbled by his cum. It feels so nasty, having to talk with a mouthful of his cum, but for some reason, it's also turning me on. I'm so horny, so hot and wet for his massive goblin cock, and I can't help but push back against him, begging for more.[Choice: He enters you.",

I need... need fff... mmmh...\"\n\n\"Gonna stuff you full with my big, green cock, fill that soggy snatch o' yours!\" His voice makes me feel dizzy. It's like my mind is full of cotton, can't think past his big, mean words.\n\nMy full mouth keeps my moans muffled, just these incoherent, low noises trapped under all the icky cum.\n\nThen Snib's big, nasty cockhead is pressing against my pussy lips! They're all plump and slippery, spreading open for him and, ohhh~, his cock feels so big and dangerous against them.\n\nThe force of his thrust sends a ripple through my cushiony body, making my big tits wobble against the fabric of my dress.\n\nAnd then *he pushes in*.\n\n“Guh—Ahnnn!

His cock is so big, so *much*, it fills me up completely. My pussy walls stretch wide around his thick shaft, each ridge and vein sending waves of pleasure through me. The feeling is so... it's... it's...\n\n\"Good fucking cow! Keep that load in yer mouth, or I'll dump another one in this tight breeder hole of yours!\" Snib grunts, his thrusts slow and deliberate, as he fucking impales me on his cock, stretching my tight, squelchy pussy around his girth.\n\n“Unghaa... fuuh... fuuh so...” My words are all garbled, the goblin cum mixing with my spit as I babble nonsense. My breath is hitching, my chest heaving as he fucks me senseless.\n\nHis cock is pushing so deep, *so* deep, hitting places inside me that make my eyes roll back in my dumb, empty head.\n\nThe slap, slap, slap of his hips against my big, jiggly ass is like a beat, a nasty, perverted rhythm that fills my bedroom.\n\nI can't even think anymore, my mind's all gooey and blank. There's just Snib, Snib, Snib and his giant, fucking cock pounding my pussy. His balls are slapping against me, spanking my clit with their cum-laden weight.\n\nMy pussy gushes, drooling out more juices to soak the sheets below me.\n\nHe pulls out suddenly, leaving me feeling empty and cold. But then he's gripping my hair, turning my head to face the mirror. He grins, his eyes twinkling with wicked delight.\n\n\"Open up, slut. Show me what a good gobbo cum holder ya are,\" he orders, and without a second thought, I do as he says. I open wide, revealing his heavy load still filling up my mouth.\n\n\"Pwaaaah...\" I whine, my voice high and needy. I can see it, my reflection in the mirror with my mouth all stretched and full with his nasty, thick cum.\n\nWith a roar of laughter, Snib slams back into me. My body jerks forward, my moan muffled by his nasty load in my mouth.\n\n\"Uuughhh, mnnnghhh!\" I'm humming, squealing around the thick, hot spunk filling up my mouth, as Snib rams that fucking massive cock of his into me.\n\nThe goblin's grip tightens in my hair, yanking me back against him, forcing my back to arch obscenely as he angles his thrusts to target deeper, more sensitive spots inside me.\n\nMy whore-hole's just swallowing him up, all juicy and gushing, stretching around his dick like it's made for him.\n\nWham, wham, wham!\n\n\"Mmmph, oh g-gawwd, uuh uh uh!\" I whimper pathetically, each thrust pushing another whimpering, slutty cry out of me. My brain's totally mush, just a swirling, horny mess of throbbing need. His massive, nasty balls slap against my clit with each thrust.\n\nMy tits are bouncing around, flopping out of my ruined dress, their heavy, teardrop shape bobbling with each of Snib’s brutal thrusts. I can feel my nipples, all hard and pointy, rubbing against the moist sheets, sending delicious jolts of pleasure straight to my brain. Makes me all dumb and blank.\n\nThe bed *squeaks* and *groans* under us, like it's struggling to hold the brutal, filthy fucking his goblin cock is delivering.\n\n\"GUGUHH...Uhn! Uhn! Louder, titcow!

His disgusting, massive load of nut-sludge is thick in my mouth, swirling, wriggling like it's alive. It feels right, somehow. Right to be gagging on goblin cum while getting fucked like a cheap whore.\n\n\"Uuuggghhh—gonna cum! G-gonna—AHHHNNN!\"[Choice: Cum.",

My pussy clenches around him spasmodically, desperate to milk him, to draw every last drop of his vile seed deep within.\n\nThe climax builds again, more intense than ever.

AHHHHHHH!\" My body convulses viciously, my pussy clenching around his still-spurting cock, milking him deeper into my desecrated womb.\n\nHe grunts loudly, a primal sound of triumph as his balls empty the last of his ghastly load inside me. \"Yeah, take it all, human cow. That’s all you're good for now!\"[Choice: He breeds you, again and again.",

      "text": "\"Sleep tight knowing you're marinating in gobbo cum, tits-for-brains,\" my goblin master sneers, and I feel a twitch inside me as another dribble of his jizz leaks out.\n\nI'm not even really a person to Snib; I'm just a place to unload, a nice welcoming cumdumpster. I can't even speak—my vocal cords only produce a series of indecent, mewling whimpers that could melt any remaining dignity into abject nothingness.\n\nMy mind is utterly scrambled, mashed into a soupy, shivering mess from the relentless, thorough pounding from Snib's monstrous goblin cock. Each after-quiver of my thoroughly pounded womb sends splashes of his vile spunk bubbling up my quivering cunt, making crude, wet noises as it drools out, slopping onto the bed.\n\n\"Uuughh... so full... all filled up and heavy... *inside* me...\"\n\nMy voice is nothing but broken, whimpering, aural garbage, slurring into the filthy darkness surrounding us. The bed is absolutely trashed, soaked through with the thick, goopy mess of multiple rounds of goblin breeding.\n\nSnib is still on top of me. His tiny, gnarled hands patting my jiggly, over-used rump as if he owns it—because, right now, he does.\n\nThe aftermath is grim—a wet, sticky disaster. Snib's hefty loads ooze out of me, soaking into what used to be the sanctity of my marriage bed. It’s a bed now defiled, the sheets warped with the nasty stains of goblin seed, every inch telling a horror story my once-hero self would have fought to prevent.\n\nThe goblin has collapsed on top of me after nutting so many times. His still semi-hard cock is lodged inside me, twitching occasionally as if proud of its devastating conquest.\n\n\"Stay still, whore. Yer my cozy lil' mattress now,\" he murmurs, a disgusting sort of tenderness in his voice that chills me more than any threat could. \"No move, titcow... comfy...\"\n\nSnib's eventual snores break out between his short, victorious chuckles, a smug rhythm to the sound of his dribbling cock still lodged deep inside my cum-soaked pussy.\n\nThe realization hits like a slap: Elara will never look at me again after what I've just done. Not after I've been reduced to a quivering, squealing, cum-stuffed toy for a goblin. Letting him breed me.\n\nThe feel of Snib—small yet overwhelmingly dominant—draped over my back, his grotesque member nestled deep in my womb, is dehumanizing. Trying to find some semblance of comfort while pinned under a goblin, used as a nighttime cock-warmer, filled to the brim with his cum, is a low I never imagined.\n\n\"Mmphhh... need to... find a way to sleep... like this...\" I mumble to myself, shifting ever so slightly to find a less uncomfortable position. Snib stirs, grumbling nonsensically in his guttural dialect, his cock twitching inside me, spurting a bit more of his thick, yellowish jizz me as I shift.\n\nSquirming slightly, trying not to dislodge the sleeping beast, I reach a hand down between my legs to assess the damage. Fingers touch the slippery, sticky mess, and tears prickle at the corners of my eyes, not from pain but from the sheer absurdity of my predicament.\n\nBreathing hard, doing my best to ignore the cramps beginning to form from the unnatural fullness of my womb, I try to ease the discomfort. My big, fat tits are squashed awkwardly beneath me, nipples aching from the constant press against the cum-soaked sheets. Slowly, I wiggle, just enough to drag my ruined dress up, pulling it over my head in a clumsy motion, using its tattered fabric to mop up some of the worst of the cum around us.\n\nWith every little move, his cum keeps sloshing inside me—deep, wet sounds coming from my well-used hole. It's so filthy, so wrong, yet all I can do is lay there, sniffing back the tears that the horrid reality of my situation brings.\n\nMy thighs quiver, weak from being repeatedly spread and pounded; my lower belly feels weirdly heavy, distended with what feels like gallons of goblin sludge.\n\nFinally, lying in the silence broken only by Snib's satisfied snoring and the occasional squelch of his cum leaking out of me, I close my eyes. My body aches, every inch of me feeling like it's been marinated in shame and obliterated dignity.\n\nAs sleep starts to claim me, the last coherent thought that dribbles through my degraded brain is a mindless, broken whimper-echo of the reality now:\n\n*His... cum... it’s inside... breedin’ me... snk... so full... s’deep...*\n\nAnd in this absolute defeat, I drift off—the weight of a vile creature pressing down on me, its semi-hard cock still nestled within the wreck of my once-fierce body, marking the irrevocable loss of everything I once was.[Choice: Sleep.",

Ughh...\"\n\nEvery single spot feels... sore, my muscles aching like I've been in an all-night brawl. Except it wasn't a fight... it was Snib, the relentless goblin, wrecking me over and over.\n\nHe's still... still *inside* me.\n\nAs if worshipping the cold, cruel morning sun, he's right there, his body draped heavily over my back. His back rises and falls peacefully, his gross goblin snores filling my ears. Snib’s grotesquely oversized cock still lodged deep inside me, holding me in place, like some disgusting, living anchor.\n\nI try to focus, but my brain is still swimming in the murky haze of his goblin pheromones. Does that mean... does it mean...\n\n“Uugh... oh gods... nngh...”\n\nI'm pregnant now. The thought is a weird little spark in my befuddled brain. His thick, nasty cum from last night is like this gross goo so deep inside of me. Those little monsters swimming up, settling into my womb. And now it’s like... like they're... festering in there.\n\nThe bed is a mess. It smells so funky, like a barn-yard horror show. Crusty patches of dried goblin cum are splattered all over the sheets and my skin, creating sticky, gross spots that pull when I try to move.\n\nSnib's snores vibrate through me. His legs splayed on either side of my fat ass.\n\n\"Uhhhnnn.\" I try to shift, just slightly. My muscles scream protests.\n\nMy eyes water with the effort.\n\nEach little move sends a weird, tingly sensation radiating all over my sore body. He shifts, his massive cock twitching with a lazy, sleepy *jerk*.\n\n\"Uh—hnnnnngh!\" The twitch hits me like a jolt.\n\nThe bed creaks, adding its squeaky voice to the morning as I try once more to wriggle out from under him. It's futile; his weight and his cock, they're keeping me pinned.\n\nWorse? His shifting movements and the soporific rub of his cock against my inner walls don't make him budge. Instead, his cock only seems to get harder, straining rigidly within my over-stuffed, deeply impaled cunt.\n\n\"Pluhhh...\" I whimper, my voice a pathetic, needy sound lost in the air.\n\nHis thick, nasty goblin spunk dribbles down my inner thighs in sticky, curved rivulets, pooling anew against the filthy sheets. The smell's just overwhelming, a cum-musk odor that's all-consuming, seeping into every pore, lingering heavy.\n\nI'm like a doll under him. My attempts to move are like weak, pitiful flailing under his pressing, immobilizing snore.\n\n\"Ungh...\" I try to shake my butt just a little. At first, it's just to see if I can somehow dislodge him. But as soon as I move, he shifts, and his cock throbs harder inside me, his weight sinking deeper into my back. \"Mmmph, p-please, Master, wake up...\" I whimper.\n\nIt seems like I can't wake him up with simple motions.\n\n“Ungh... g-gods... oh fuck…”\n\nI’m so full... so tied to the bed. It’s degrading—a goblin, a fucking goblin, owning me so completely.\n\nIt’s like nothing else matters, because his cock is my world right now, literally nailing me to the spot.\n\nI try again and give another little shake, but all it does is wake him enough for him to readjust, his legs spreading wider around my fat ass. His snoring resumes, louder.\n\nTrying to catch my breath, I brace myself and slowly, very slowly, squeeze my pliant inner muscles around his intruding organ. The motion is foreign and painful; my body feels bloated from sheer overuse and penetrative fatigue.\n\nBut his cock jerks again, a heavier throb reverberating through it and up into my beleaguered cervix. My womb distends with the shivering, violently throbbing member, still trying to acclimate to the thing bullying my insides.\n\n\"Uhh... ughh... w-wake up, M-Master...\" My voice is a cracked whisper.\n\nWith my thighs trembling from raw exertion, I start to grind my hips back against him ever so slightly.\n\n\"Ugh... gods... j-just... wake up...\"\n\nThere’s a dull, aching thud in my womb. A hollow sort of pressure that originates from the very center of my overused, stretched-out pussy, radiating outward. My muscles are worn and frayed, overworked to the point of utter numbness, but beneath that numbness is a throbbing sore sensation that pulses in time with his prodigious, invasive length.\n\nI can’t even think straight. His cock is basically all my head is filled with—this gnarly brain-dragging mass inside me making logical thoughts slip. I whimper pathetically into the pillow, feeling a shameful mix of degradation and longing as Snib’s cock continues to harden inside me.\n\nThere’s only one way, my dumb goblin-cum-soaked brain whispers. Only one way to wake him up.[Choice: Milk him awake.",

All I can think of is his cock inside me, twitching, growing harder with each passing moment… and the idea takes root in my muddled mind that I have to finish what I started.\n\n“Uuhhnn... fuck...”\n\nMy fingers tremble as they grip the edges of the pillowcase, and I bite my lip to stop the humiliating sounds that threaten to bubble out. I start to clench my inner muscles rhythmically around the goblin cock impaling me, squeezing tightly, relaxing, and then squeezing again in slow, degrading pumps.\n\nThe motion is agonizing, each contraction of my pliant walls igniting nerve endings that had been so thoroughly brutalized the past two nights. But there’s an inkling of pleasure—an insidious, creeping warmth that spreads tendril-like from the focus of my exertion into my drool-dribbling brain. My body's getting all mushy again... goblin-induced bimbo state settling in.\n\n“Ngghh... c’mon, Master... wake up,” I murmur, my voice weak and whiny.\n\nI can feel his cock pressing deeper against my cervix with every twitch, the fat head demanding entry to the sanctum it already conquered.\n\nThe putrid stench of our combined fluids wafts up, making my nose crinkle.\n\nYet, here I am... still pushing back, trying to grind against his stupid goblin meat log.\n\nA barely audible whimper slips free as I move my hips in slow, small circles, the dull ache of my bruised pussy increasing each time his cock head hits that firm barrier deep inside me. The predatory throb of his thickness scares and electrifies—my mind fuzzed out enough to not just endure the shame, but to be kinda... hot for it…\n\n\"Ohhnn... please Snib... wake up... Your big cock... I...\"\n\nHis snoring changes timber, transforming from a mere rumble to a heavy, almost thoughtful breathing. It’s rhythmic, telling me he’s close, closer to the edges of consciousness, the thrumming of need waking him.\n\nI push back harder, movements sluggish but determined, feeling every vein and bump of his monstrous cock within me. Milking it, coaxing it awake. The degrading act fuels a submissive suck to my soul. His snoring slows, his body reacting.\n\nFinally, I can hear it—a guttural, filthy groan, thick with the throaty growl of arousal. His still-groggy hand travels down, sinking greedy fingers into my waist to grip my hips tightly, stabilizing his position.\n\n\"My, my,\" Snib's voice breaks the fog of silence, coated in a veneer of cruel amusement. \"Look what we have here. My little slut... waking me up by using her slutty hole.\"\n\n\"Mnghh—yes, m-master... had to wake you... couldn't move, needed to wake you,” I mumble out like a mindless, horny doll.\n\n\"'Course ya did, titcow. Yer brain's all addled by my spunk,\" he sneers. \"Got me a morning wood now, 'cause of yer slutty grinding. Better finish the job, huh?\"\n\nA cruel laugh escapes him as he pulls out of me, the obscene *shlurck* sound making me whimper from the emptiness, my sopping pussy already missing his presence. His cock bobs heavy and hard in front of me.\n\n\"Get yer fat udders out. Gonna make ya finish it with yer big tits.\"[Choice: Finish him with your tits.",

My mind, soaked in goblin pheromones, is hazy and compliant. My body hums with a lingering heat.\n\nSnib's every command feels like a deeply ingrained compulsion I can't resist.\n\nI ease myself onto my back, the effort making my sore muscles scream. My massive, quivering breasts spill out, flopping to either side.\n\nSnib's cock twitches eagerly, the sickening stench of his musk permeating the air again. He doesn't waste time, flopping his heavy, veiny log between my massive, jiggling boobs.\n\n\"Nnnghh... oh...\"\n\nHis pre-cum is already drooling from the fat purple head, oozing out and slicking up the sensitive flesh in a warm, sticky mess. Each pulse of his need sends more of that hot fluid spreading across my skin.\n\nI use my hands to press my enormous, pale tits together around his twitching shaft, creating a snug, soft tunnel for his pleasure. My body obeys without question, driven by the haze of goblin pheromones wrapping around my brain.\n\n\"See, titcow,\" Snib says. \"Yer putty in me hands now. That gobbo cum’s done more than just breed ya—it’s made ye a proper little slut.\"\n\nHis words make my cheeks flush hot with shame, but the degradation fuels a stupid, needy moan from my lips.\n\n\"Mmh... yes...

I massage him with soft, upward and downward strokes, my pliant breasts gliding smoothly over his slick, veiny girth.\n\n\"Mmmh, so b-big...\"\n\nHe laughs. \"Feels good, dun it? Yer massive fuckin’ tits, all soft and wet around Master’s cock? This is all yer good for now, titcow. Letting me do whatever I want.\"\n\nI whimper, caught between the humiliating truth of his words and the undeniable pleasure stirring from my mind-numbing submission. His cock smears more hot pre-cum against my flushed skin with each stroke, making it easier to stroke him up and down, my movements growing more rhythmic and automatic.\n\n\"It's a shame, ye know,\" Snib continues, \"that the wizard’s making Elara stay at the castle. Yer wife... she's missing out on all this.\" He grins down at me. \"Wouldn’t it be nice to have her back here? Living with us?\"\n\nThe idea seeps into my dazed mind, twisted with a sliver of hope. My wife, Elara, with me again, in our home. But there’s something sinister under his suggestion. He wants to sink his claws into her too.\n\nHis cock throbs between my breasts as I keep squeezing my massive, jiggly tits around him. \"Nnnh... yes... I w-want her… want her back...\"\n\n\"Of course ya do,\" he growls. \"But ye gotta convince her. And ye know the best way? Give her a taste of me gobbo goo.

The slickness of his pre-cum lubricates my breasts, making it easy to glide them up and down in a rhythm, every stroke sending an electric jolt through my body.\n\n\"Yer really missin' yer wife, and it'll just get worse,\" he says.\n\nHis words tug at the last fibers of my dignity, reminders of a time when I was... someone else. The thought of feeding Elara goblin cum fills me with dread. It feels... wrong, a step too far.\n\n“M-Master... c-can’t... she’s my wife...” I manage between shameful, needy moans. “I... need to k-keep her s-safe...”\n\nSnib smirks, one hand moving to roughly knead my breast, making me whine. “Oh, but ya see, lass, sometimes we gotta do what's hard to keep the ones we love... safe. And she's safer here with us than with that evil wizard in the castle dungeon.” His voice drips with persuasion. “Ya know how my goo made ye feel good, right?”\n\n“Y-yes... but...”\n\n“But nothin'. If Elara gets a taste, she'll understand. She'll know the power of gobbo seed, just like you do now.”\n\nI whimper, squeezing his cock tighter between my tits. Every stroke pushes me further into the fog. My thoughts are slippery, but somewhere, deep down, reality nudges at me—Snib’s intentions aren’t pure.\n\n“Unghh... N-not sure...”\n\n\"Look at me,\" Snib commands. I tear my gaze away from his drooling shaft to meet his cruel, gleaming eyes. \"Ye think yer keepin' Elara safe by stayin' away? Nah, she's in danger every moment she ain't with us. Can't protect her from the wizard, can ye?\"\n\nThe idea, ridiculous as it is, gnaws at the remnants of my sanity twisted with my love for Elara. His gruff voice worms its way into my thoughts.\n\n\"But... giving her cum... it'll ruin her,\" I protest weakly, still trying to process the idea while continuing to pump his enormous, grotesque member with my pliant tits.\n\nAnother harsh laugh rips through him. \"Nah, ye just gotta give her a lil' taste, see? Just a little gobbo goo, slipped into her drink. It'll work wonders. She'll come runnin'. She'll still love ya.\"\n\nMy mind falters, my resolve crumbling under Snib's relentless pressure and the fog of his potent pheromones. Every command, veiled as a suggestion, starts sounding more like the only logical choice. \"But how...\"\n\n\"Just a drop o' the real potent stuff,\" Snib's grin widens, showing his cruel yellow teeth. \"You gotta ease her into it. Make her see what she's missin'. Give her a lil' taste, let that gobbo cum do its magic. Best if it's a day old.\"\n\nThe rhythm of my breasts on his throbbing, pre-cum leaking shaft speeds up unconsciously.\n\n\"She needs to be here, with ye,\" he continues slyly. \"And the only way to get her here is to make her *want* it. Ye know how good it feels now, don't ya? That gobbo cum's got power. Ye gotta use that... to keep yer wife safe.\"\n\nHe rolls his hips into my cleavage, his cockhead throbbing steadily between my trembling, sweat-slick tits as he easily manipulates me. I let out a messy, wet moan, the idea of having Elara here, safe, somehow managing to override my better judgment.\n\n\"But... if I do that... she'll...\"\n\n\"She'll be under our protection,\" he interrupts. \"Ye don't want her in harm's way with that evil wizard, right? Make it real nice for her. Bring her close. Ye'll be happy. Together.\"\n\nHis cock throbs violently then, as if in agreement with his twisted logic, more hot pre-cum bubbling up to coat my skin. My hands work erratically, desperately trying to keep up.\n\n\"Y-yes... for her... safety...\"\n\n\"Atta girl, titcow. Uhhh-ah! That's the way... Shluck,‘cause the only way she'll know... day-old gobbo goo, slid in her drink, slip her a taste.

I feel his shaft twitch.\n\n\"I'll... tell her... bring her home... she...\" I'm panting now as I try to make him cum.\n\n\"Good lil' slut. Yer doin' so good...\"\n\nHis need speeds, his movements growing more urgent as his cock twitches precariously between my massive tits. The sight of him—a vile, small being—using me, coupled with his indelible words is too strong an influence under his pheromonal haze.\n\n“Tell her, titcow. Convince her. And we’ll have her here... *safe.*”\n\nSnib grunts, his words a command I can't refuse, not anymore. My brain is fogged, my logic so thoroughly wrecked. I nod dizzily, mindlessly compliant to his clever, foul manipulation, all while my soft, pliant tits milk his gnarly goblin log.\n\nAlready, in my addled state, I’m thinking of ways... ways to slip Snib’s cum into Elara’s drink. To keep her safe... to bring my wife home... in the twisted nest of goblin control, with me. And I’m moaning, deluded and dreamily lost.[Choice: He's getting close...",

      "text": "[Image: borderless]\nI’m barefoot as I go about preparing breakfast for Snib.\n\nIt feels like one of those dreams, where everything’s just... *off.* Everything’s fuzzy, thoughts mingling with memories and fantasies until I can’t recall where one ends and the other begins.\n\nSnib lounges at our wooden table, his small, yellow eyes following my every move as he ogles me.\n\nIn the corner, near the fireplace, Zephyrion uses his arcanameter to observe me. Symbols light up, spinning and blinking as he monitors the readings of the cursed collar around my neck.\n\nThe wizard’s demeanor is ever the same—calm, calculating, and absolutely devoid of empathy. He’s like a cool statue, eyes glinting with hidden knowledge. Every so often, his brow furrows slightly.\n\n\"Master Zephyrion,\" I start, my voice soft and tentative. \"May I... may I please see Elara?\"\n\nI half expect an immediate rejection, but the wizard's eyes narrow, his fingers continuing to manipulate the glowing runes on the arcanameter.\n\n“I have already told you,” Zephyrion says, his voice measured, devoid of any sympathy or warmth, \"that it’s too dangerous. Your wife is now under the protection of Mayor Bramble at the castle, and after yesterday's incident, it’s not feasible for you to see her without endangering your life.\"\n\nMy heart sinks at his words. \"Please, Master Zephyrion,\" I plead, my voice breaking. \"I-I miss her so much. I... I just need to see her, to know she’s okay. She’s my wife...\"\n\nZephyrion’s eyes flick back to the arcanameter, studying the readings. I catch a glimpse of a rare emotion – dissatisfaction, possibly. Something about the readings.\n\nThe wizard’s gaze returns to me. I know he doesn't respect me; to him, I’m just another component in his grand experiment, a tool to unlock greater power.\n\n\"Elise,\" Zephyrion says, his voice dropping into a thoughtful murmur. \"You must understand the importance of your role. The collar you wear is not a simple trinket. It requires intense emotional and physical stimuli to reach its full potential.\"\n\nI nod numbly, barely grasping the implications of his words. All I want is Elara. I need her.\n\n\"But...\" my voice trembles, tears welling in my eyes. \"I need to see her. She’s everything to me.\"\n\nAt my display of emotion, the arcanameter flickers more brightly. Zephyrion's eyes widen slightly in realization, noticing the reaction of the collar to my heightened emotional state. His lips curve slightly.\n\n“Did you notice that, Elise?” he begins, tone shifting to a more measured cadence, though his eyes are alight with discovery. “It does appear that your connection to your wife triggers a noticeable response in the collar’s energy output... interesting. I had thought it purely reacted to reactions to the collar's master.”\n\n“I... I guess... I mean, she’s my wife... I love her…” My sobs continue to choke my words, the weight of my despair pressing more heavily on my heart. The wizard can't know that the collar *wants* me to fulfill Snib's task - to poison my wife with goblin sperm. Is it playing some sort of game?\n\n“I do not see the benefit in facilitating a visit to the castle,” Zephyrion begins slowly, eyes glinting with hidden depths of thought. “Any such visit would necessitate you being alone. Your wife, Elara, is in a distraught state after the last encounter. I do not want her in the same room as the goblin.”\n\n“I… please…” I whisper, my heart aching as I think of Elara. “I just want to see her... to make sure she’s okay…” My voice quivers.\n\n\"Any visit would also require Snib’s explicit permission,\" Zephyrion continues, not looking up from the glowing runes. \"Without his approval, the collar may interfere.\"\n\n“Y-yes, Master Zephyrion. I understand,” I say, my voice trembling with the depth of my longing. Inside, a cringe-inducing guilt claws at my chest. I’ll be poisoning my beloved Elara, but it’s what Snib wants... what the collar pushes me towards.\n\nSnib’s leer grows. “What ye reckon, wizard?” he asks, cruely lacing his words. “Let her go see the missus, eh? If it means bringin’ back better readings fer yer magical whatchamacallit, ain't it a win?”\n\nZephyrion’s eyes narrow.\n\n“The readings might substantially improve if Elise experiences significant emotional flux. The collar reacts strongly to her emotional and physical states. An emotional reunion could serve this purpose.”\n\n“Please, Master Snib... Master Zephyrion. I'll be good... I'll follow your rules... just let me see her. She’s my wife.”\n\nMy voice quivers, and yet, that desperate, hidden purpose gnaws at me.\n\nSnib chuckles. \"Guess that's that, then. Ye got my permission, titcow. But ye better keep in mind yer still mine. Don’t forget where ye belong.\"\n\nZephyrion inclines his head slightly, observing the glowing arcanameter showing promising fluctuations.\n\n\"Very well,\" Zephyrion says, his tone showing the faintest note of satisfaction. \"Your visit will be sanctioned under strict conditions. You will go alone, and you will adhere strictly to my terms. Your actions will be monitored, and any deviance will result in severe repercussions.\"\n\nI feel my heart ache and recoil at the intense emotions whirling within me, fueled by Snib's vile influence. \"I’ll follow the rules,\" I whisper, my voice barely audible.\n\nSatisfied with the agreement, Zephyrion turns back to his meticulous analysis.\n\nSnib's hand roughly pats my head, a grotesque semblance of affection. \"Good girl. Make sure ye remember, it's all fer keepin' yer wife safe, right?”\n\n“Y-yes, Master,” I mumble.[Choice: Later that week...",

      "text": "The gates of the Eboncrest keep rise before me. Just beneath the soaring battlements lies a relatively modest entryway with a portcullis, meant to hold off invaders.\n\nI glance down at myself. The red dress I'm wearing is one of Elara's. The fabric strains across my generous curves, especially where my massive breasts and fat ass overfill what is for her a well-fitting garment.\n\nCold stone walls give way to rough, sturdy floors—rows of torches lining the passages barely fighting off the succumbing shadows. Soldiers in gleaming armor—royal guards bearing the blue and silver sigils of King Richard Valarian—flank me on either side. Their well-maintained plate armor clinks with every measured step, swords sheathed at their hips.\n\nThe small courtyard bears some agricultural barrels and wooden fences for horses tied up near the entrance.\n\nA young stable boy scurries by with fresh hay, casting curious glances towards us.\n\nThe guards march me through the keep’s halls, where walls give way to half-open archways, windows.\n\nWe arrive at a large wooden door leading further inside. The guards stop.\n\nStepping through the entryway is Captain Giles, his broad-shouldered presence commanding immediate attention. His eyes, sharp yet soft, study me for a moment before he speaks.\n\n“Elise.”\n\nThe captain turns towards the lead royal guard, a stern-faced man with a scar running down one cheek.\n\n\"Corporal Rhys,\" Giles addresses him formally, with a respectful yet defiant edge, \"this is my jurisdiction. Elise is under the care and protection of Mayor Bramble.\"\n\nRhys stiffens. “We have direct orders from the wizard. Elise is to have an audience with... *her* wife. We are to ensure her safe passage and return.”\n\nA burly militiaman with a bushy beard, Sergeant Brin, moves to stand just behind Giles. \"Corporal, with due respect,\" Brin growls, \"we don't take kindly to outsiders barking orders in our own keep.\"\n\nRhys raises an eyebrow. \"We follow the wizard's orders, and by extension, the King’s.\" He gestures to the emblem on his armor.\n\nGiles steps forward then, placing a calming hand on Brin’s arm. “We don’t need to make a scene,” he says, voice steady but edged with warning. \"We’re not defying the King, Corporal. We’re implemting the will of Mayor Bramble who holds jurisdiction here. Aldric—Elise—is family to us. We will ensure her visit goes smoothly, and she will be returned to you immediately afterward.\"\n\nTwo of the royal guards shift, their hands moving closer to their swords. Brin's lips pull back in a snarl, his own men responding in kind by gripping the hafts of their axes and swords.\n\n“If there’s any trouble,” Rhys says, voice steady with underlying threat, “the wizard will hear of it.”\n\nCaptain Giles’ eyes flicker. “We’re not here to make trouble, Corporal. You have my word she will be returned today. My counsel to you is to explain to Zephyrion that Eboncrest’s goodwill remains—with no incident.”\n\n“Fine,” the corporal says, tersely. “But any deviation from the agreement will result in immediate consequences.”\n\nGiles nods. “Understood. Now step aside; we’ve wasted enough precious time in quarrel. Sgt. Brin, escort Elise under watchful eye.”\n\n“Walk with me, lass,” the sergeant says, his voice a warm, comforting rumble. \"I know things haven't been easy. But we're keepin' things together, alright? You got friends here still, y'know that.\"\n\n\"Th-thank you, Brin,\" I mumble, my voice just above a whisper. The familiarity of his presence is a balm to my frayed nerves.\n\nBrin’s eyes soften for a moment. \"No matter what, you're still Aldric to me, ya know?\"\n\nCaptain Giles walks ahead of us.\n\nThese men were my friends once. Good friends.\n\nWe reach the grand entrance of the dining hall, my heart pounding in my chest.[Choice: Enter the dining hall.",

High wooden beams support the ceiling, and chandeliers made from wrought iron hang low, casting their flickering light over the polished oak table laden with the finest feast Eboncrest can provide.\n\nAromatic roasted meats fill the air with their mouth-watering scent—duck with honey and herbs, mutton with garlic and rosemary. There are bowls brimming with vibrant vegetables: roasted carrots glazed with butter and thyme, peas and beans mixed with savory pancetta, and a medley of root vegetables cooked to tender perfection. Freshly baked bread is stacked high on platters, alongside dishes of rich, creamy butter and various cheeses, their rinds cracked and revealing smooth, tangy cores.\n\nGolden pies line the center of the table, their crusts flaking under a gentle touch to reveal the steaming insides—beef and ale, chicken and mushroom. Berries and fruits, plump and ripe, serve as a reminder of the fertile lands we are surrounded by. Jugs of fragrant spiced wine and homemade ale are scattered between the food.\n\nBut my eyes are only on her.\n\nElara.\n\nShe stands near the long, polished oak table, her fiery red hair cascading around her pale, tear-streaked face. Her sapphire eyes widen as they lock onto mine, and in an instant, she’s rushing towards me.\n\n“Elise!” she cries, her voice breaking with emotion.\n\nShe wraps her arms around me, pulling me into a tight embrace. The familiar scent of her—roses and lavender—fills my senses, momentarily pushing away the stench of goblin musk that clings to me like a shadow.\n\n“Elara,” I whisper, my voice trembling.\n\nHer sobs are raw, heartfelt, shaking her shoulders as she clings to me. “I’ve missed you so much,” she chokes out, her tears wetting my neck. “I thought... I thought I might never...”\n\n“I’m here,” I murmur, holding her as tightly as I can. My heart twists painfully, the love I feel for her overshadowed by the weight of what I’m about to do. Hidden between my breasts is the small glass vial of day-old goblin cum, pressing against my skin.\n\nElara steps back slightly, her beautiful face marred by a storm of emotions. She runs her hands over my face, touching my cheeks, my hair, as if assuring herself of something.\n\n“I'm so sorry,” she says, her voice cracking. Anger and distress line her words. “I almost got you killed. I just wanted to protect you... I was so angry... I got you hurt...”\n\n“No... no,” I whisper, placing a hand over hers. “It's fine. I'm fine.”\n\n“I saw the way Snib... what he did to you…” She swallows hard, a sob catching in her throat. “And now... I’m locked here because I refused to...”\n\nI draw a shuddering breath, my fingers trembling against her soft skin. “I know... I know...” I bite my lip.\n\nBehind us, Captain Giles watches the exchange. \"Let us take our seats.\"\n\nAs we sit down, Mayor Bramble enters the room. He steps up to the head of the table, raising his hands to command silence.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he begins, his voice warm but tinged with sorrow, \"we are gathered here today under trying circumstances. Our beloved Aldric, now Elise, and his dear wife, Elara, face hardships that none of us could have ever foreseen.\"\n\nThe room is filled with murmurs of agreement, the townsfolk’s outrage simmering just beneath the surface. Elara grips my hand tightly under the table.\n\n\"I must apologize sincerely,\" Mayor Bramble continues, \"for the distress you have been put through. It is a travesty, and my heart aches for you both. However, you must understand that I am compelled by the crown to comply with the orders of Master Zephyrion.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Master Zephyrion's plans, as distasteful as they are to all of us, come directly from our liege, King Richard Valarian. As much as I wish it were otherwise, my hands are tied.\"\n\nElara stands then, her voice quaking yet firm. \"Please, Mayor Bramble! You have the authority and influence to entreat the King. Tell him what we are suffering!\"\n\nThe mayor's face falls, heavy with regret. \"Elara, I have tried. But King Richard's ear is not easily swayed, especially with Zephyrion whispering counsel. There is nothing more I can do.\"\n\nAs the mayor’s words hang heavy in the air, Sergeant Brin rises. He slams his fist on the table, rattling the platters of food. \"The crown has no right to do this to our town hero! Aldric has saved us time and time again! And now look at him!\"\n\nBrin points directly at me, my pallor likely showing the effect of his promptings. Militiamen seated around the table explode into agreement, their voices rising in fierce proclamation.\n\n\"Aye! It ain't right!”\n\n“Let 'em go home!”\n\n“Makes no sense!”\n\nThe uproar grows, the men’s shouts mingling with the scrape of chairs and the clinking of tankards. Elara joins their fervor, her voice a bright, impassioned plea among the din.\n\nCaptain Giles remains seated, his eyes never leaving Elara. His expression is one of deep concern, the kind intensity within his gaze clear as he gently places a hand on her shoulder.\n\nHe speaks.\n\n“This is not the time or place for rash actions. Getting riled up will not help Elise or Elara; we need to think clearly.”\n\nBrin, his face flushed with anger, pounds the table again. “Think clearly? While our hero is being forced to suffer like this? He should be with his wife, in his own home—not chained up under the thumb of that cursed wizard and pathetic little goblin!”\n\nCaptain Giles stands then, a firm yet collected figure, his tone now carrying an edge of command. “Sergeant Brin, it would be wise to stop drinking so much wine. Anger will get us nowhere. We must proceed with tact and thoughtfulness.”",

We deserve to—\"\n\nThe words catch in my throat. Images of Snib overwhelm my thoughts. The haze grows thicker, my senses muddled. I struggle to stay focused, to keep my thoughts from slipping into depravity.\n\n\"He has no right to keep me under the control of that filthy goblin! Snib's... Snib's huge, nasty cock shouldn't... shouldn't be what decides my fate!\"\n\nThe room goes deathly silent. Every pair of eyes widen in shock and horror, some faces flushing with embarrassment, others with disgust.\n\nRealizing what I've just said, my hands fly to my mouth, my cheeks burning red. “Oh g-gods... I didn’t—”\n\nElara’s eyes widen in utter disbelief, her mouth agape. Captain Giles' brow furrows, and Brin’s face reddens even more, veins popping in his neck.\n\n“You see!” Brin roars, recovering from his shock. \"*Even the woman's mind's* been addled by that cursed goblin! It's disgraceful! She was our hero!\"\n\nThe crowd erupts further, their voices becoming more intense, the anger rising like a tidal wave. Militiamen slam their fists on the table, shouting for justice, for an end to this nightmare.\n\nElara clutches at my arm, her grip tight and desperate as tears well in her eyes. The scene spirals out of control, the outrage of the townsfolk reaching a fever pitch.\n\nCaptain Giles stands, raising his hands for calm. “Enough! We must maintain order! Sergeant Brin, that is quite enough! This is turning into a riot!”[Choice: Step back...]\"Please, everyone!\" My voice starts soft but grows stronger, cutting through the escalating noise. The room stills, eyes turning towards me, hoping for rationality amidst the chaos.\n\n\"We have to be rational... to endure... this situation,” I begin. “Master Zephyrion... the crown... has ordered... unh...\"\n\nMy words taper off, thoughts suddenly clouded by Snib’s scent and my mind fogging up with the memory of his massive, throbbing cock.\n\n\"Z-Zephyrion's orders... we must comply with them,\" I continue after an awkward pause, trying to redirect my thoughts. \"It hurts, it’s hard... very hard... S-Snib’s... big, fat... cock...\" I mumble, my thoughts slipping out before I can stifle them.\n\nRealizing my mistake, horror floods my features and my hands fly up to cover my mouth.\n\nThe room is plunged into a shocked silence, faces wide-eyed and slack-jawed.\n\nElara's lips part, her eyes brimming with tears.\n\nSergeant Brin, on the other hand, is nearly apoplectic, his face turning an alarming shade of red.\n\n“You see?!” he bellows, rising from his seat, wine spilling from his tankard. “The wizard, and that goblin, have corrupted our hero’s mind to such an extent—allowing such disgrace to continue is abhorrent!\"\n\nOther militiamen rise with him, voices raised in fervor, agreement rippling through the assembled townsfolk. Chairs scrape back, tankards slam down, the air thick with their growing outrage.\n\n“*Gods!* Aldric was our hero, and now look at what they made him become!”\n\nThe tension escalates, the room pulsing with the raw energy of their combined anger.\n\n\"ENOUGH!\" Captain Giles' voice booms through the dining hall, a forceful command that does little to calm the brewing storm. \"We need to remain in control—Sergeant Brin, you should *stop* drinking so much!\"\n\nGiles' eyes flick to Elara, offering a supportive look though his expression tightens at my earlier outburst.\n\n“If their safety is our concern, we must act with strategy, not raw emotion.\"\n\nElara, too, stands, impassioned and desperate. “We have to convince the King! We have to end this madness!”\n\nBut the room’s descent into chaos accelerates. Brin's voice cracks with fury. “They *ruined* our hero! Are we to stand idly by and let this continue?!”\n\nThe rowdy feast morphs into an impassioned rally, me in the eye of the storm, aching beneath layers of humiliation and the intoxicating remnants of goblin pheromones—my words having fed the very flames I sought to dampen.\n\n\"Everyone, please, listen! We need calm heads and thoughtful action!\" Captain Giles' gaze, calculating and kind, meets Elara’s often, placating her while asserting control over the crowd.[Choice: Sit back down.]",

He leads us through the throng of angry townsfolk. Elara’s sapphire eyes are wide with distress, her grip on my hand like iron.\n\nWe navigate through the winding halls of the keep, the torches casting long, flickering shadows on the stone walls. Giles ushers us into a side door, leading to a smaller, more intimate chamber—the private quarters assigned to Elara.\n\nThe door closes behind us, muffling the distant noise of the feast-turned-chaos.\n\nThe room is modest but cozy, with a small bed covered in soft linens, a writing desk, and a hearth crackling with a warm fire. Elara releases my hand, her face pale and strained.\n\n“Elara, I’m so sorry,” I begin, my voice trembling. “I-I didn’t mean to—”\n\nHer eyes fill with hurt, her lips trembling. “Elise... what you said…”\n\n“I— I wasn’t thinking... the haze... it’s so hard...”\n\nGiles places a reassuring hand on Elara’s shoulder. “Listen to her, Elara. This is what goblins do. They break people, even those as strong and heroic as Aldric once was. The pheromones... they cloud the mind. We’ve seen it before, many times. It's heartbreaking, of course.”\n\nElara’s eyes well with tears, her gaze shifting between me and Giles. “It’s just... seeing her like this... it’s tearing me apart.”\n\nThe captain nods solemnly. “We know when village girls are taken by goblins… sometimes the effects are irreversible. Even the moonshade remedy can fail, and the wizard has made sure there’s none left in town.”\n\nMy voice is barely a whisper. “It’s so difficult being like this... it’s like I’m losing myself...”\n\nElara’s sobs deepen. “Oh, Elise...”\n\n“You need to consider the possibility,” Giles continues softly, his eyes laden with sorrow, “that Elise might be too far gone.”\n\nThe weight of his words crashes over Elara, and she buries her face in her hands, her body shaking with grief. Giles’ hand remains on her shoulder, his presence a comfort she leans into. I feel a pang of jealousy and fear as I watch their interaction.\n\nFinally, Elara looks up, her eyes red and puffy. “It’s good to see you again, Elise. Despite... everything.”\n\nTears well in my eyes, and I nod. “I wish you could stay with me. We could be together...”\n\nGiles’ expression hardens momentarily. “It would be far too dangerous to have Elara around that creature, Elise. The risk is too great.”\n\nElara looks conflicted, her eyes filled with a complex mix of yearning and caution. “But...”\n\n“Elara,” Giles interjects gently, “you must think of your safety. What happened in the dining hall is a clear indication of how volatile things can become. The goblin is a threat, and exposing yourself to its presence is too risky.”\n\nElara’s shoulders slump, the weight of defeat settling in. She nods reluctantly. “I understand...”\n\nWe sit in heavy silence, the crackle of the fire the only sound interrupting the quiet.\n\nGiles’ voice softens once more. “We will find a way through this, Elara. I promise you. Elise needs our support, but we must also think clearly and rationally about every step we take.”\n\nElara looks at me, sorrow and resolve mingling in her gaze. “I just want to save you, Elise.”[Choice: You have a decision to make...",

The urge to retch is strong, but I force it down, holding the caustic substance under my tongue.\n\nTurning back, I see Elara’s worried face. Her sapphire eyes glisten with tears, a stark contrast to the warmth I once saw in them. Taking a deep breath through my nose, I step closer, pulling her into a tight embrace. The familiar feel of her in my arms brings a surge of bittersweet nostalgia.\n\n“Elise?” she whispers, her voice trembling. “What’s wrong?”\n\nUnable to respond with my mouth full of the foul, sticky substance, I cup her cheek gently, guiding her face toward mine. Her brows furrow in confusion, but she trusts me enough to let me draw her closer.\n\nOur lips meet hesitantly at first, a soft brush that instantly sends guilt crashing through me. But I push deeper, every muscle tensing as I part her lips with mine. Her eyes widen as the warm, sticky goblin cum seeps from my mouth into hers.\n\n\"Mmmph?! What did you do to me?\"\n\nHer initial moan is one of shock as the viscous fluid transfers, her blue eyes stretching in bewildered panic.\n\n\"MMMPH!!! What are you doing?\"\n\nI push forward, my hands gripping her shoulders to prevent her from pulling away, ensuring the vile fluid flows from me to her.\n\n“Mmpff—”\n\nI feel her try to recoil, but I hold firm, ensuring the transfer is complete. Her body quivers, and then—\n\n“Mmmn...”\n\nA soft, almost involuntary moan escapes her lips as the pheromones within the cum begin to take effect. She starts to swallow, driven by the overwhelming compulsion imparted with the dose.\n\nElara’s body tenses, then relaxes, the reaction almost immediate. She coughs and gags, her face contorted in disgust and confusion as the last of the thick, rancid cum slides down her throat.\n\n“What... what’s that taste?” she gasps, pulling away from me abruptly, her eyes wide in horror and betrayal. “Elise, what did you—”\n\nThe door bursts open, and Captain Giles stands in the frame, his eyes blazing with suspicion.\n\n“What’s going on here?” he demands, striding into the room with purpose. He grabs my arm roughly, pulling me away from Elara.\n\n“I... I’m sorry!” I stammer, my heart pounding in my chest. “I... it’s just my breath... I-I’ve spent so long with Snib... it must be the taste...”\n\nGiles’ grip tightens, a mixture of anger and deep concern darkening his features. Elara coughs again, her body shaking as she tries to process what’s just happened.\n\n“This meeting is over,” Giles snaps, his voice cold and authoritative. “Elara, are you alright? Elise, we’re leaving. Now.”\n\nElara gasps, her breath ragged. “My head... ugh...”\n\nGiles’ eyes narrow at me, but he doesn’t press further in front of Elara. Instead, he leads me firmly out of the room, keeping a tight grip on my arm. His face is set in stony determination as he marches me down the corridor.[Choice: You're escorted back home.]My hands tremble as they brush against the hidden vial nestled between my breasts. The glass is cool against my heated skin, the vile contents inside pulsating with a menacing aura. The haze thickens around my thoughts, Snib’s words echoing in my mind, urging me toward the unthinkable.\n\n“Elara,” I whisper, my voice shaky, “I... I want to help us be together, but...”\n\nShe looks at me with such love, such unwavering trust, her sapphire eyes filled with worry and hope. The weight of my decision crushes down on me. My wife. Our baby. The sheer moral horror twists my insides.\n\nTouching the vial, I can feel the pull of the dark influence tugging at my thoughts, telling me to just do it—to feed my beloved wife the goblin sperm. To poison her mind and body as mine have been poisoned. But in my heart, a tiny spark of resistance flickers.\n\nMemories flood my mind—days of battle, victories hard-won when I was Aldric, the love I shared with Elara, the future we dreamed of. That spark grows, fueled by the remnants of my humanity, of the hero I once was.\n\n“No…” I murmur, the haze squeezing tighter. “No, I can’t...”\n\n“Elise?” Elara’s voice is a lifeline, pulling me from the depths of the fog. “What’s wrong? You’re scaring me...”\n\nA surge of clarity breaks through the muck clouding my mind. The realization, the stark, undeniable truth hits me like a hammer: I can’t do this. I can’t trade my moral integrity, the safety of our unborn child, and my wife’s well-being for a twisted sense of closeness.\n\n“No!” I cry out, my hand jerking back from the vial. It slips from my grasp, the small glass container falling in slow motion.\n\nElara’s eyes widen in confusion as the vial hits the floor with a soft clink. The contents spill out, the putrid yellow goblin sperm spreading in a slow, sickening pool. Realization dawns in her eyes, a dawning horror mixing with betrayal.\n\n“Elise…” Her voice breaks, tears streaming down her cheeks. “What... what is this?”\n\nI choke on my words, unable to form a coherent denial. “I... I didn’t...”\n\nThe door crashes open, and Captain Giles steps in, his eyes cold and calculated. He takes in the scene, his jaw tightening in anger. “What is going on here?”\n\nThrough my sobs, I manage to croak, “I... I have to go... I shouldn’t be near Elara... I can’t trust myself...”\n\nGiles’ hand clamps down on my arm, pulling me away from Elara. “Have you no dignity left, Elise? To even consider poisoning your own wife with this vile substance? Have you no morals?”\n\nElara’s sobs echo in the room, her pain palpable. “Elise... how could you?”\n\n“I didn’t mean to! I’m so sorry! I... I love you!” I sob, my heart shattering as Giles drags me toward the door. “Elara, please believe me. I never wanted to hurt you or our baby...”\n\nCaptain Giles’ grip tightens, his voice a low hiss in my ear. “She is innocent, and she will be kept separate from your corruption. You should be ashamed.”\n\nHe marches me out of the quarters and down the hall, the echo of Elara’s sobs haunting every step.[Choice: You're taken back home.]",

Giles releases my arm, his stern gaze shifting to the guards.\n\n\"There were no issues,\" he says briskly. \"Escort her back to the wizard.\"\n\nThe guards nod, relief evident on their faces. They seem genuinely grateful for the lack of complications, eager to report back to Zephyrion without incident.\n\n\"Thank you, Captain,\" says Rhys, his voice respectful. \"We will see her safely returned.\"\n\nGiles catches my gaze one last time. \"Be careful, Elise,\" he says softly, a hint of something more lingering in his tone.\n\nWith that, the guards flank me on either side, bringing me back home.\n\nZephyrion stands in the doorway, his eyes sharp and cold as the arcanameter glows in his hand. He steps forward, the crystalline device humming with a soft, eerie light as he raises it toward the collar around my neck.\n\n\"Ah, Elise,\" he murmurs. \"I trust your visit was... productive?\"\n\nMy heart races as the glowing runes on the arcanameter spin faster, the device pulsing in response to the energy from the collar. His eyes narrow, a pleased expression creeping onto his face.\n\n\"It seems the levels are rising again,\" Zephyrion notes with satisfaction. “Very good.”\n\nHis cold, calculating gaze meets mine, and I shiver under its weight.\n\nWith that, he turns, the arcanameter dimming as he walks away. The guards nod respectfully to him before departing, leaving me standing alone in the doorway.\n\nA shadow moves within the house, and Snib emerges, a cruel grin spread across his face. His yellow eyes gleam with anticipation as he strides towards me, his voice rough and demanding.\n\n\"Well?\" he growls. \"Did ya go through with it?\"\n\nA lump forms in my throat, and I can barely manage a nod, my gaze dropping to the floor in shame.\n\n\"Y-yes... Master...\"\n\nSnib's laughter is harsh, the sound grating against my nerves. He grabs my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze, his eyes searching mine for any sign of deceit.\n\n\"Good girl,\" he sneers. \"Yer a proper little slut, aren’t ya? Betraying yer own wife like that.\"\n\nA sob escapes me, tears pooling in my eyes. The weight of my actions crushes me, the overwhelming guilt mingling with the residual haze of the goblin pheromones.\n\n“All fer me, huh? All so ya can keep ‘er ‘safe’. Ain’t that sweet?”\n\nThe words cut deep, each one a reminder of the twisted reality I’m trapped in—the reality I've subjected Elara to as well.\n\nHe releases my chin, shoving me backward. \"Yer gonna be real useful now. Just wait ‘til ya see what’s next.\"[Choice: Later that night...]Snib’s eyes snap up as I step inside.\n\n\"Well, well...\" he sneers. \"Lookit what we have here.

Without warning, he lunges forward, gripping my wrist with shocking strength.\n\n\"Did ya do it?\"\n\n\"N-no... I couldn't,\" I whisper.\n\n\"Ye stupid bitch!\" He roars, pulling me down and bending me over the arm of the worn-out couch. \"Couldn't poison your lil' wifey for me? Useless! Let's see how ye like this!\"\n\n“M-Master, I... I tried...\" I tell him what happened.\n\n“Ain’t no excuses for ya, titcow!” Snib snarls. “Got yer stupid self *caught?!?!*”\n\nI whimper, my legs giving out as he roughly forces me over the armrest of the chair, my ass bared and vulnerable.\n\n“They coulda figured out our plan! Now we gotta discipline ya, y'slut!”\n\nHis gnarled fingers grip the hem of my dress, yanking it up over my hips in one swift motion, exposing my ass. My breaths come in ragged gasps as he brings his broad, calloused hand down hard on my defenseless flesh.\n\n*Thwack!*\n\n\"AH!\" I cry out, the stinging pain searing through my body. My mind swims in a messy mix of fear, shame—and a horrible, twisted pleasure.\n\n“Yer nothin’ but a mindless, breedin’ cow for me,” he spits, his voice filled with malice. “Tryin’ to think on yer own! Ya belong to me!”\n\n*Thwack! Thwack!*\n\nEach heavy strike lands with brutal precision, reddening my skin in uneven welts.

Mayor Bramble follows, his round face flushed with concern, and then Captain Giles, who strides in, his eyes blazing with anger.\n\n\"This is an outrage!\" Captain Giles thunders, his voice filled with fury. \"Allowing Elise and this... this degenerate goblin to live in Elara's house is putting every single one of us at risk! They need to be removed from Eboncrest immediately!\"\n\nZephyrion steps forward, his demeanor cool but with an underlying intensity. \"Let us maintain a level of decorum, Captain. There’s much to discuss.”\n\n“As distasteful as the situation is,” Mayor Bramble says, his mustachioed face filled with regret, “perhaps relocating Elise and Snib to another location within the town would suffice?”\n\nCaptain Giles' jaw clenches, his eyes narrowing with barely suppressed rage. \"The inn is out of the question. Snib was already kicked out of the Silver Stag Inn for absolutely destroying the room! If they are to remain in Eboncrest, they should be put in the whorehouse. The Midnight Rose. It’s a fitting place for such debauchery.\"\n\nMayor Bramble's eyes widen. “That... that establishment is for...”\n\n“The dregs,” Giles interjects coldly. “It’s a place of debauchery. It’s fitting. At least there, they won’t insult the common folk with their presence.”\n\nSnib's eyes flash, but he remains silent, his thin lips curling into a grotesque smile.\n\nZephyrion closes his eyes momentarily, collecting his thoughts. When he speaks, his tone is an effortful calm. “Fine. If this arrangement satisfies the need for protection and order within Eboncrest, we shall move them to the Midnight Rose.”\n\nThe mayor’s face is drawn, but he nods in reluctant agreement. “So be it.”\n\nThe three men exchange sharp looks, their decision set.\n\n“It is agreed then,” Giles says sharply, his tone final. “Elise and Snib will be relocated to the whorehouse immediately. The house must be cleaned of this filth.”[Choice: Your new life begins...]",

I sit near the small hearth, the flames casting flickering shadows on the walls, my thoughts a tumultuous storm.\n\nA soft knock at the door startles me. For a moment, I hesitate, my heart pounding in my chest. I rise slowly, the air heavy with a sense of impending doom.\n\nI open the door, and there she stands—Elara. Her fiery hair is disheveled, her sapphire eyes glassy with a mix of confusion and something else, something darker. She seems flustered, almost like she's been running, her breaths coming in quick, shallow pants.\n\n“Elara...” my voice trembles.\n\nShe steps inside, her movements jerky and unsteady. Her cheeks are flushed, her lips parted slightly as she tries to catch her breath. There’s something in her eyes that wasn’t there before, a glint of something unfamiliar and unsettling.\n\n“I— Elara, what are you...”\n\n“I don’t know,” she murmurs, her voice distant, almost... vacant. “I couldn’t stop thinking about... about you... about him...”\n\nMy heart twists painfully at her words. I step aside, letting her pass, my mind screaming at what I've done.\n\nSnib emerges from the shadows, a cruel grin spreading across his face as he takes in Elara’s state. His yellow eyes gleam with a predatory hunger as he approaches her.\n\n“Well, well... look who decided to join us,” Snib rasps.\n\nElara looks at me, but it’s as if she doesn’t truly see me. Her eyes dart to Snib, her expression shifting to something disturbingly akin to desire.\n\nI swallow hard, my throat dry. “Elara, I—”\n\nShe cuts me off, her voice a whisper. “You... both of you... smell terrible. We... we should get into a bath. Must bring some order to this house.”\n\nSnib’s hand snakes out, roughly fondling Elara’s ass. She lets out a soft, involuntary moan, her body arching slightly into his touch.\n\n“Ngh...” She shivers, her eyes fluttering closed for a moment before she opens them again, hazy and lost. “The bath... let’s... let’s go...”\n\nThe air is solid with tension, my heart breaking. The haze of lust and despair intertwines, muddling my thoughts. I can barely think, the fog thick around my mind, but through it all, the pain of seeing Elara like this—so lost, so changed—tears at my very soul.The day-old goblin sperm has totally corrupted your wife's brain.[Choice: This is my doing.]",

Horace is a portly figure with a pockmarked face, his weary eyes lined with years of overseeing Eboncrest's underground cravings. His gaze slides over me—lingering on my exposed skin above the white bikini top and the leather skirt that scarcely covers anything.\n\nSitting behind his cluttered desk, Horace rubs his temples. \"Snib, I've told you before. Your room's a sty. My maids are refusing to work in those conditions. It's bloody disgusting, even for here!\"\n\nSnib sneers back. \"Oh, come off it! Ya know good 'n well why we's 'ere. The mayor, the wizard—they want us tucked away in your cozy lil' sex den.\"\n\nHorace grunts, disapproval etching deeper lines around his mouth. \"Don't care if the bloody mayor himself signed it off. I run a clean operation, relatively speakin'. You're muckin' it up!\"\n\nThe conversation grows heated, Snib’s yellow eyes narrowing shrewdly. Suddenly, he jerks a thumb at me. \"What if tits-fer-brains here... we put her to work, eh? Have her earn her keep 'round this joint, and we split the profits.\"\n\nI tense. My cheeks burn with the heat of humiliation, tears of powerless resistance glistening in the dim light.\n\n\"Oh, she's quite the looker, ain't she?\" Horace leans forward, his gaze raking over my body with such intensity it feels like his eyes are fingers, touching, probing. \"No doubt there'd be plenty willing to pay top coin for a round with the hero-turned-slut.\"\n\nThe brothel hums with the soft moans and hidden whispers of its occupants.\n\n\"But keep it quiet, yeah? We don't want the mayor or any other puffed-up official hearin' 'bout this,\" Horace says with a crooked grin, revealing yellowing teeth. \"I’ve got channels, can spread the news quiet-like.

I get my cut, and Elise, well... she gets to be useful, don't she?\"\n\nUnder the heavy weight of their stares, a whimper escapes my lips, a pitiful sound drowned out by the atmosphere of the brothel. I nod dumbly, my body and mind no longer my own.\n\nThe goblin's influence, thick and oppressive, guides my actions, drowning out the small voice of reason screaming within the depths of me.\n\nHorace rubs his hands together, a gleeful chuckle escaping him. \"Alright then, it's settled.

      "text": "The oaken door creaks as it opens, and a foul mix of cheap perfume, incense, and sweat wafts into the dingy room where we are lined up, shoulder to shoulder. The flickering torchlight casts long, distorted shadows as the patrons enter—seedy men with greedy eyes, their apparel hinting at professions that range from mercenaries and sailors to lowly merchants.\n\nWe stand in a rough line, the other girls eyeing me with a blend of curiosity and pity, some even showing outright distaste. Each girl presents herself with a calculated flair: one wears a low-cut bodice spilling ample cleavage; another, a slender blonde with tantalizing tattoos cascading across her skin, lifts her skirts slightly to reveal smooth, enticing legs.\n\nThe men shuffle in, muttering amongst themselves about the available \"wares.\" My heart pounds as each new set of eyes flick over me, some lingering disapprovingly for longer than others. The sound of murmurs fills the air, growing louder as they assess the merchandise.\n\nThey know. They seem to all know.\n\n*It’s Aldric…*\n\nMy transformation into Elise is the dark, unspoken undercurrent; that I’ve been touched by Snib is unmistakable—a taint and stigma that mars the line of otherwise eager, undamaged prostitutes. Instead of mingling near me, the other girls huddle closer to the opposite end of the lineup, their expressions flickering with judgment and fear.\n\n\"You see her?\" murmurs a stout, bald-headed man with pockmarked skin, elbowing his toothless companion.\n\n\"Hmph, ain't right,\" the other growls. \"Hero like 'im should be dead 'fore ending up like that.\"\n\nA drunkard with a tangled beard staggers closer, eyes raking over my figure. “Hero m’sarse. Shoulda never come back after dealin’ with gobbos.”\n\nSuspended by the weight of their stares, my cheeks flame as I struggle to maintain composure. Every fiber of my being screams that I don’t belong here, that this shouldn’t be happening.\n\n\"Lads, ye don’t understand—the one there,\" Horace gestures towards me, \"this here is Elise—you might know her better as Aldric the Great! Our once-hero turned into a ripe lass for your enjoyment. Quite the catch, wouldn’t ya say?\"\n\nBut the attempt falls flat; distaste and a twisted sense of respect color their faces. Most of the men move on to examine the prettier offerings, leaving subtle remarks and sidelong glances in their wake.\n\nOne lecherous client steps closer. He’s scruffy, with a missing tooth and a scar running down his cheek. His breath reeks of alcohol, and a leer spreads across his unshaven face. \"Unreal, hah,\" he chuckles, his voice a wet rasp as he reaches out.\n\nHis hands, rough and grimy, latch onto my massive tits, lifting and dropping them with curious fascination. I bite my lip, struggling not to recoil or cry out.\n\n\"Well, look at the size of these here, lads,” he snickers loudly. \"Hero's got fat udders!\" He gives a rough squeeze before finally moving on to another girl.\n\nSnib basks in the scene from across the room, a twisted smile of satisfaction plastered on his face. His eyes glint mockingly, relishing in my humiliation after what I failed to do.\n\nI can’t escape the gnawing terror that rumors will reach Elara. She already thinks the worst of me, but if she hears of this...\n\nWhispers float around, \"Touched by a goblin...\"\n\nI notice a few old faces—companions from battles, villagers I saved. Their eyes slide away awkwardly when they recognize me.\n\nA nobleman draped in rich, velvety robes stops in front of the girl next to me, his eyes dismissing me entirely.\n\nHorace, desperate to drum up interest, claps his hands. \"Gentlemen, do you understand the opportunity standing before you? This isn't just any girl—this is the great hero of Eboncrest! Aldric the Great, who dominated bandits, monsters, and even the wildest of beasts. Now, imagine the stories you'll tell about how you dominated *her* in bed tonight!\"\n\nThe words send a ripple through the patrons that hadn't considered me before, their twisted curiosity piqued. Some of the drunker ones chuckle and elbow each other, leaning in for a closer look at me. My skin bristles under their leering stares.\n\nI stand there, flush-faced and trembling, trying my best to remain still despite the overwhelming humiliation. My hands rest awkwardly at my sides, my large breasts heaving with each uneasy breath.\n\nThe door to the brothel creaks open ominously, and an imposing figure casts a long shadow across the room. Everyone's attention shifts, and the atmosphere grows dense with a mix of dread and morbid curiosity.\n\nThe man entering is none other than Thaddeus \"Greasegut\" Grimjaw, a local crime boss known for his dirtiest and bloodiest enterprises—smuggling, extortion, and more reprehensible acts best left unspoken.\n\nThaddeus is massive, both in girth and presence. Rolls of fat spill from his stained, ill-fitting clothes, and his fleshy face is a sweaty, glistening mask of lechery. A leering, unhealthy smile stretches across his lips as he surveys the lineup, his small, piggish eyes squinting with lustful glee.\n\nMy heart drops. I’ve faced bandits and monsters, but nothing quite compares to the repulsion I feel now. I recognize Greasegut. This was the same fat repulsive criminal I’d put away for violently extorting the local bakery—where he had a particularly nasty reputation for assaulting young women who couldn't pay up. He was convicted of several other heinous burglaries and armed robberies, but corruption saw his sentence undermined. He was out far too early—clearly, some strings pulled in his favor.\n\nHe lumbers down the line of girls, each one visibly relaxing once he passes them by, relieved to have escaped his attention. When his eyes land on me, they widen in shock, and his leering grin grows impossibly wider.\n\n\"Well, well, well,\" he booms, his voice dripping with a revolting glee, \"if it isn't Aldric the Great, now going by Elise, bowing to the whims of us lowly common folk.\"\n\nThaddeus approaches, his breath reeking of alcohol and stale tobacco. He reaches out with a pudgy hand to lift one of my massive breasts, hefting its weight with perverse fascination. His touch is clammy and revolting, and I can barely suppress a shudder of disgust.\n\n“A prime cut indeed,” he sneers, squeezing roughly. “So tell me, Horace, just how did you come to have this fallen hero gracing your establishment?”\n\nHorace, sensing the potential for a profitable transaction, steps forward with a smirk. \"Master Grimjaw, it is a twist of fate. Our dear hero here was evicted from her own home after an incident at the castle. The wizard and the mayor decided she’d be best put to use in our little corner of Eboncrest.\"\n\nA malicious chuckle rumbles through Greasegut’s massive chest. \"Is that so? Seems ol’ Aldric’s quite the lady now...\" His eyes sparkle with sinister delight. \"What’s the price for such a unique piece of meat?\"\n\n“She’s high-value, a rarity,” Horace asserts, his tone oily. “I'd say 250 gold for a night with our special attraction. As of now untouched... by human hands...”\n\nGreasegut scoffs, shoving a grubby hand into his jacket pocket and pulling out a heavy pouch. “I’ll give you 300.”\n\nHorace's eyes light up with greed, and he extends his hand to shake on the deal. \"Done. But remember, Master Grimjaw, no permanent damage.\"\n\nGreasegut's hideous grin widens. He winks and lets out a vile laugh.\n\nMy heart races. The pheromonal haze can't shield me from the loathing I feel for this horrid man. His hands continue to grope and fondle, his perverse joy evident in every revolting touch.",

He’s horrible!”\n\nThe room goes still; even the most hardened men seem taken aback by my desperate plea.\n\nSnib steps forward, his yellow eyes gleaming. He snaps his fingers, and the collar around my neck tightens painfully, forcing a whimper from my throat. \"Oh no, tits-for-brains here don’t get to choose,” Snib growls. “You’re gonna earn me money, whether you fucking like it or not.”\n\nThe tightening collar sends a bolt of pain through my neck. Grimjaw chuckles darkly, the sound like rocks being crushed. \"Yeah, if there wasn't some fight left in her, it wouldn’t be as fun,” he says, grinning ear to ear. “How about I up the ante? Four hundred gold.\"\n\nHorace’s eyes practically glow with avarice. “You got yourself a deal,” he agrees, nearly salivating.\n\nI try to pull away, but Grimjaw’s massive hand clamps down on my ass, squeezing and groping in front of everyone. His touch is rough, his fingers digging in.\n\n\"Heh, nice and jiggly,\" he leers, his thumb brushing against my sensitive spot, making a whimper escape my lips. The other girls edge away, their pity turning to cold indifference. \"You got a bit more cushioning than I remember, Aldric.\"\n\nThe brothel room Grimjaw leads me to is one of the most opulent, reserved for only the wealthiest and most perverse of clients. Dark, heavy drapery hangs from the walls, and rich carpets muffle the sound of footsteps. In the center of the room, amidst extravagant furniture, stands a set of intimidating equipment—wooden stocks, leather restraints, chains, and racks lined with various instruments.\n\nGrimjaw's enormous hand, clammy and rough, encloses mine as he guides me inside. His grip tight, the smug satisfaction emanating from him is suffocating. He locks the door behind us, the sound of the bolt sliding into place thudding in my chest like a hammer on an anvil.\n\n\"Here we are,\" he purrs, his voice a sickening blend of delight and anticipation. \"A private little den for just us two.\"\n\nMy heart pounds in my chest, breaths coming shallow and quick. I know all too well the depths of his sadism, and the role reversal from hero to his plaything twists a blade of shame and terror within me.\n\nGrimjaw waddles over to a large, padded chair, sinking his massive frame into it with a satisfied groan. \"Now, Elise,\" he says, his eyes narrowing with malevolent glee. \"Why don't you tell me how we met last, hmm? Let's recount those rather thrilling events.\"\n\nI swallow hard, my throat dry as sand. \"You... you were extorting the local bakery... assaulting the women who couldn't pay up.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" he smirks. \"Samantha, wasn't it? And little Mary? So delightful...\"\n\nHe laughs, the sound sending a shiver of revulsion down my spine. \"But you stopped my fun, didn't you?\"\n\nSwallowing, I force myself to continue. \"I caught you in the act. Arrested you for violent extortion... armed robbery... rape...\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he mocks. \"Put me behind bars. But look at us now, Elise. The mighty Aldric, reduced to a desperate little whore. Quite the turn of events, wouldn't you say?\"\n\nI nod, tears pricking at my eyes. “What... what do you want from me?” I whisper, my voice trembling.\n\nGrimjaw’s smile widens, revealing his yellowed teeth. He drums his fingers against the arm of his chair, his eyes gleaming with dark delight.\n\n“Zaelasia, it's a funny place, isn't it? Gives me a second chance to teach you a lesson. To get... what I deserve.”\n\nHe stands, his immense bulk looming over me. With a sharp yank, his hand pulls me closer, his rancid breath washing over me as he speaks. “Yhe night’s still young, and there’s plenty of fun to be had.”\n\nTears spill over my cheeks as I realize there’s no escape. Snib would stop me if I tried to flee. I’m trapped, my only option to endure and satisfy this monster’s vile appetites.\n\n“Tell me, *Elise*,” he purrs, his voice dripping with venomous amusement. “How does it feel, being taken down so many notches? From hero to whore?”\n\nI swallow, my voice barely above a whisper. “H-horrible... I... I hate it.”\n\n“Good. So, let’s make this fun for you,” he purrs, retrieving a riding crop from the table. He tosses it to me, his eyes twinkling with malicious delight. “Here’s your sword, hero. Let’s reminisce. How about a little play-acting? I’ll be the wicked fiend - oops, I mean myself - and you... you’ll be the valiant hero, come to stop me.”\n\nMy hands shake, gripping the crop as though it’s made of hot iron.\n\nGrimjaw chuckles, unbuckling his belt and letting his trousers drop to the floor. His thick, hairy cock is repulsive—long and uncircumcised, clearly unwashed.\n\n“Now, catch me in the act,” he commands, turning to position himself by a simplified wooden cross. He kneels, pretending to thrust into an imaginary victim, smacking the air with his hand and calling names. “Come on, hero! Stop me if you can!”\n\nI stand frozen, the crop heavy in my clammy hands. \"S-stop right there! Release her!\"\n\nHe laughs, a deep, revolting sound. “Make me, Aldric!”\n\nMy voice cracks. “Release her or I’ll... I’ll strike you down!”\n\nI lunge forward, the crop swinging. The blade of sadness and knowing futility cuts deeper than the fantasy sword in my hand. The crop makes contact with Greasegut’s shoulder, but he just laughs harder.\n\n“Ha! Gotta do better than that, hero! Aim for the vital areas!”\n\nAs I aim for a more painful impact, Grimjaw effortlessly reaches up and catches it. His large, pudgy fingers wrap around the thin shaft, stopping it mid-air. The sheer strength in his grip renders my efforts futile, and a smirk spreads across his grotesque face.\n\n\"Well well well, Aldric. You seem a bit more... voluptuous than I remember,\" he taunts, mockingly sizing me up as he stands to face me.\n\nThe terrible familiarity of his mocking tone grates against my senses, the memory of his laugh as he was dragged to prison echoing in my ears.\n\n\"You're not quite the daunting hero anymore, are you?\" He tosses the 'defeated' imaginary girl aside with a lewd gesture. \"Unfortunately for our dear damsels, I haven't relieved myself in a month. My balls are practically bursting; you can imagine the... urgency.\"\n\nHe drops the riding crop, letting it clatter to the floor, and slowly lumbers toward the ornate chair placed strategically in the center of the room. Each step he takes is heavy, thudding ominously against the plush carpet.\n\nSitting down, he spreads his legs wide. His erection is blatantly obvious, painfully hard and disgustingly dirty. The sight of his thick, veiny human cock is a stark contrast to the goblin physiology I've been forced to adapt to—the smell is less musky, but somehow worse.\n\n\"Now,\" he leers, his voice dripping with vile excitement, \"imagine this, my erstwhile hero. These poor maidens will be spared my voracious appetite if a certain... brave soul were to alleviate my terrible condition. Imagine—their hero, once again saving them. Though, perhaps, in a more... intimate manner this time.\"\n\nI stand frozen, horror washing over me.\n\n\"Come now, don't be shy. It's just a little heroic deed. One last quest, hero,\" he sneers. \"Help me out, and I’ll let the imaginary girls go—your honor as a hero intact.\"\n\nStepping closer, he grabs his hard cock, giving it a few slow, deliberate strokes while his other hand motions me forward. \"Come on, Aldric. Show me how much you've embraced your new role. Let's see how well you can wield that pretty mouth of yours instead of a sword.\"\n\nHis chuckle is low and menacing, each syllable designed to degrade, to remind me of how far I've fallen.\n\n\"Think of it as your duty, to save those who can't save themselves. Isn't that what heroes do? Sacrifice themselves for the greater good?\"\n\nThe room spins, my mind a maelstrom of disgust, anger, and unbearable shame.\n\nSlowly, sickeningly, I approach him, each step heavy with the weight of my lost dignity.\n\n\"That’s it, come closer,\" Grimjaw murmurs, his voice oily.

Heroic acts require struggle.\"\n\nHe pushes me away and waddles over to the rack of devious devices.\n\n\"Physical restrains too, makes the victory sweeter, don’t it?\" He picks up an armbinder, eyeing it with grim satisfaction before turning towards me. “How about we make this a bit more interesting? You don’t get to use your arms or legs. A hero can only triumph through struggle, after all.”\n\nGagging, I clench my hands into fists, but he’s quick and ruthless. He grapples with me, pushing my arms behind my back, sliding the armbinder up my forearms and over my shoulders. The leather straps pull my arms together tightly, ensuring I couldn’t break free no matter how hard I tried.\n\nGrimjaw makes sure every strap is taut, his pudgy fingers grazing my flesh, sending waves of revulsion through me. \"Oh, yes,\" he purrs, \"just like that.\"\n\n\"Please... this isn't right,\" I beg, but my pleas fall on deaf ears. He only laughs, slapping my ass, making me jump and flinch.\n\n“Stop squirming; it'll only make things worse,” he smirks, pulling out more bonds from the rack. He binds my legs next, forcing me to sit with my legs folded to the side. The intricate leather and metal cuffs snap securely around my thighs and ankles, rendering them utterly useless.\n\n“There. Bound nice and tight.” Grimjaw stands back to admire his handiwork, watching as I teeter helplessly on my knees, poised awkwardly, unable to rise or move. His hand roams to my breasts, squeezing and groping roughly. \"Such massive, juicy tits. Perfect for a fallen hero.\"\n\nEach touch heightens my shame and helplessness - I’m powerless to stop him. His coarse fingers knead my tender flesh, all the while making lewd noises of approval.\n\n“You see, Elise, without the struggle, it’s all too easy. I need to savor this. Make it a true quest.” He lifts me effortlessly, despite his girth, carrying me to the large, cushiony bed covered in opulent velvet.\n\nIt CREAKS loudly as his massive weight settles into it. He stretches out, his legs spread wide, his bulk summit-like in its immensity.\n\nI’m placed near the edge, my eyes filled with undignified tears. I have to crawl, wriggle over to him.\n\n\"Come on, hero,\" he sneers, retrieving the riding crop and slapping my ass with a sharp...[Choice: ...THWAK!",

My body jerking from side to side, with each movement my huge, sensitive tits jiggle, the exposed flesh quivering as I force myself to move forward. My breathing becomes more labored as I heed his command, each inch a torment.\n\n\"That’s it, hero, show me your determination,\" he mocks. \"Remember poor Jenna? Your squire? What did I do again? Ah, yes. Kidnapped, sold to Sirath, but not before defiling her... You never found her, did you? You never knew that was me.\"\n\nEvery word is a knife cutting through the last remains of my defiance. Still, I crawl. There is no choice.\n\nThe bed shifts under me, Grimjaw's ghastly bulk pressing down on the mattress like an anchor. As I approach him, my bound position forces me to roll onto my side, wiggling closer, my breasts slapping softly against the fabric with each jerky movement.\n\nAnother *THWAK* of the crop lands on my tender behind.\n\n\"Faster, Aldric. Show me that hero’s spirit. And while you do, tell me about my crimes. Reminisce on my darker deeds. Come on now. What else have I done?”\n\nA pained sob escapes my lips. My body struggles forward, the muscles in my back and thighs burning with effort. I have to comply, I can’t defy him.\n\n“Y-you... you kidnapped the merchant's daughter... tortured her...” My voice chokes. He lies back, grinning like a perverse king upon his throne, waiting as I quiver and spill his dark history.\n\n“What else?” he presses, his massive cock hardening as I recount his heinous actions.\n\n\"Y-you... killed the baker... b-burned his house down when... he couldn’t pay... UGH!\" my voice cracks as the crop cracks against my ass.\n\n“Keep going,\" he croons.\n\nI struggle, my body pressing between his flabby, hairy legs. The vileness of his sweat-soaked skin rubs against my cheeks. My tears mix with the grime as I turn my head to align sobbing lips to his cock, feeling the throbbing heat rub against my face.\n\n“Ah, there you go,\" Grimjaw purrs. “Right where you belong—between my legs as my little hero-turned-slut.\"\n\nI crane my neck, struggling to wrap my lips around the disgusting shaft pressed against my lips. I try to force my mind to retreat somewhere else, somewhere far away from this degrading reality.\n\n\"Pleasure me,\" Grimjaw commands, his hand gripping his riding crop tightly. “Don’t you want to save those maidens?”[Choice: Try to make him cum and get this over with.",

Struggling so hard just to serve me.\"\n\nMy body flexes awkwardly, the bindings constraining me from moving with any semblance of grace. The exertion is immense, pulling every muscle taut, straining each sinew as I wriggle closer.\n\nNestling myself between his heinously hairy, flabby legs is akin to wriggling into a pit of filth. His repulsive scent envelops me, mingling with my sobs.\n\nI crane my neck, trembling, as his erect cock rubs against my tear-streaked face. It’s thick, unwashed, the taste foul and putrid as my lips part, navigating around his bulbous head. My back arches painfully against my bonds, my chin thrusting up to touch his enormous, sagging balls that press against my cheeks.\n\n\"Yesss,\" he hisses, adjusting his weight with another low, aching creak of the bed. \"Snuggle up close, hero.”\n\nMy tongue struggles, lapping feebly along the underside of his cock, each lick making my insides twist in horror. His slimy pre-cum drizzles onto my nose.\n\nThe riding crop cracks again.\n\n*THWAK!*\n\nPain flares, and I cry out, muffled by the disgusting member I’m forced to worship. I find a rhythm, minuscule movements, hoping he’ll finish quickly and end this nightmare.\n\n\"No heroics now,\" he mocks, his hand tugging my hair, guiding my head until my chin rests squarely against his hairy, fetid balls. “Oh, how the mighty have fallen. From hero to whore—how does it feel to be down here, licking the cock of someone you once put away?”\n\nHis enormous belly presses against my head, pinning me into his flabby, coarse lap. Overhead, his taunting voice continues, adding to the degradation.\n\n\"You know, they say humility is therapeutic,\" Grimjaw sneers. \"I’ve been looking forward to this. Well, not *exactly* like this - I'm not that imaginative! But you can't blame a guy for wanting to get you back.\"\n\n*THWAK!*\n\n\"Uuunnggghh... mmmnnn...\" The noises I make are muffled whimpers.\n\nEvery lick requires physical and mental exertion, the last fragments of my dignity being stripped away with each degrading moment.\n\n“Yes... that’s a good girl,” Grimjaw croons.\n\nMy hands, bound and useless, strain against the unyielding leather of the armbinder, every fiber of my body screaming in resistance as Grimjaw's pudgy, clammy hands roam lower, sliding against the waistband of my skirt.\n\nWith a sudden, brutal yank, the fabric tears, ripping away, leaving me exposed, my panties soaked with the ever-present dampness that curses my body.\n\n\"Well, would you look at that,\" he sneers. \"You're wet! Didn't know you had a taste for scum like me, Aldric.\"\n\nMy voice cracks with a sob. \"N-no... it's not...\"\n\nHe doesn't care. With two thick fingers, he drives into my soaked pussy, spreading through the slick folds that tremble at his invasive touch. I bite down the cries, and the shame burns my cheeks red.\n\n“Hah, too good. The hero’s nectar,” Grimjaw drawls, licking his fingers. “It’s just the taste of someone who’s fallen far from grace.”\n\nHis fingers plunge back in, fucking me roughly, savagely. His breath is foul, every grunt and groan accentuating the horror of the situation.\n\n“Tell me, Aldric, how many more lives were you planning to save? How many more criminals like me were you aiming to put away, before you turned into this?”\n\nMy body jerks helplessly in response, hips betraying me as they meet his thrusts, the armbinder and leg restraints causing every motion to be a flexing, aching effort.\n\nIt’s not him... it’s never him... it’s the curse of constant, humiliated arousal the goblin pheromones force upon me. My nails dig into my palms as he continues his vile monologue.\n\n“You know, Jenna... she cried a lot,” he breathes hotly, his fingers digging deeper. “Called for her hero.”\n\n“D-don’t... please... st-op...” My pleas turn into pathetic, ragged gasps as he increases his pace.\n\nMy vision blurs, the rhythm of his fingers tearing through my ravaged mind. He keeps talking...\n\n“And the baker... ah, he cooked so well. Too bad he baked better than he fought.”\n\nEach violation of my inner self is a firestorm of despised sensation overwhelming my thoughts.\n\n“You’ll cum for me, hero. You’ll cum on my fingers while I recount all the delightful horrors I’ve wrought. Come on...”\n\n“No... oh Gods... no... please...” My body trembles, fists clenched.

The gooey fluid dribbles down my face, trailing over my cheeks, dripping off my chin.\n\nHis monstrous load continues to spurt, jet after jet: some splatters into my hair, some down my chest, matting down the soft curls. Each pulse of his release seems to drain some wicked force from him, his grip loosening slightly as he shudders in relief.\n\n“Mmm, yeah. That’s a good look for you, hero,” Grimjaw breathes out heavily, finally spent. He chuckles, a weary but satisfied sound as he leans back, observing his degrading handywork.\n\nTears mix with the pools of semen, stinging as they streak down my cheeks. My lips tremble, and a sob catches in my throat. I feel humiliated, reduced to nothing more than an object of his dark satisfaction—a hero unmade, utterly and completely defiled.\n\nGrimjaw releases me and starts to tidy himself up, fixing his trousers with a smirk still plastered on his face. “Well, didn’t think you had it in ya, Aldric, to be such a good sport.”\n\nPushing himself up from the chair, he gloats with a final pat on my head, eyes blurred from the cruel baptism of his seed.\n\n\"You've truly saved the day—by draining my balls most excellently. What a performance! I dare say, we might have to make this a regular thing. Aldric the Great, my personal dick sleeve—has a nice ring to it, don't you think?\"\n\nWith a chuckle, he scoops up a handful of gold coins from a pouch at his side and casually tosses them onto the bed next to me. The coins scatter with a metallic clink, shimmering dully in the dim light. Without another word, he bids adieu to both me and the imaginary girls he conjured up in his twisted scenario.\n\n\"Goodnight, ladies!\" he calls out over his shoulder as he waddles to the door. \"Remember, this heroic tale is our little secret!\"\n\nThe door closes with a resounding thunk, echoing into the silence that now swamps the room. My eyes sting unbearably, tears mixing with the viscous semen, creating a salty, painful mess. I blink rapidly, trying to clear my vision, but each flutter of my eyelids feels like sand.\n\n\"Ahh... it burns...\" I whimper, more to myself than anyone else, feeling hot, angry tears of pain and shame roll down my cheeks.\n\nAfter a while, the door reopens. Hesitant footsteps approach me—other girls from the brothel, who heard the commotion and came to see what was left behind. They find me, a pitiful mess, still strapped down and covered in Grimjaw’s filth.\n\n\"Oh gods...\" One of them—a slight girl with bright auburn hair—kneels beside the bed.\n\nThey work quickly to undo the armbinder, loosening the buckles and straps. Relief washes over me as my arms are released, the blood circulation painfully returning to my limbs. The leg restraints are next, and the sensation of being able to freely move my legs again is both painful and joyful.\n\n“Here, let’s clean you up,” another girl, a brunette with kind eyes, says as she fetches a basin of water and a cloth. She gently wipes my face, dabbing at my eyes which continue to sting even with the careful cleaning.\n\n\"Thank you...\" I murmur, my voice gravelly from misuse.\n\nThe auburn-haired girl brings me a simple cotton gown, helping me to slip it over my head. The fabric is soft against my skin, a stark contrast to the rough treatment I had just endured.\n\n“You can take the rest of the night off, Elise,” the brunette offers gently. “Get some rest.”\n\nI nod slowly, feeling a mix of gratitude and alienation. The girls don't know me well—the infamous Aldric turned plaything of goblins and now a brothel attraction.\n\nAs they help me to stand, guiding me to a quiet nook of the brothel to rest, I overhear them quietly discussing Grimjaw.\n\n\"At least he was occupied tonight,\" whispers the auburn-haired girl to the other. \"Poor Elise, but... better her than...\"[Choice: Life in the brothel continues...",

Lass, life's rarely fair. Look around you. Think any of these girls dreamed of this life when they were little? But life gives you what it gives you. You gotta make the most of it, somehow.\"\n\nHe walks over and picks up a glass, inspecting it for dust in the dim light. \"You were lucky, y'know. That Grimjaw is one piece of work. Heard he injured some of the other girls, a while back. Got a famous temper, that one does.\"\"I will endure it,\" I grimly push out from between clenched teeth. \"I have had worse happen to me than what happened last night...\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Horace tilts his head. \"There's that spirit.

Just smolderin' a bit under the ashes, eh?\" He nods with a hint of respect glimmering in his eyes. \"Remember what that fire attracted though,\" he adds, his voice dropping to a murmur.\n\nHe walks over, nudging a fallen bottle with his foot back into alignment. \"You were lucky, y'know. That Grimjaw... he's injured some of the other girls, a while back. Fella's got a temper as famous as your heroics were.\" \"I won’t be here forever,\" I say, lifting my chin defiantly. \"This... this is only temporary.\"\n\nHorace grins, a knowing, somewhat pitying smile tugging at his lips. \"That's what they all say,\" he quips as he leans back against the wall, crossing his arms. \"But time has a way of stretching thin in places like this.\"\n\nHe steps forward, his boots scuffing softly against the threadbare rug.\n\n\"Still,\" he continues, picking up a stray cup and examining it, \"you were lucky, considering the company you pulled in. Grimjaw's done far worse than hurt feelings. Few of the girls have been the same after dealing with him.\"\n\n\"Lucky?\" I repeat.\n\n\"Yeah, right after he was released outta prison—some lord's pocket got a bit heavier, and his cell door swung open. Corrupt as a rotting tooth,” Horace grunts, setting a glass down with more force than necessary.\n\nI resume my tidying, the movements automatic, yet each action feels heavier, laden with Horace's words. Life. Luck. Fairness. Or the bitter lack thereof.\n\n\"And now, you, our hero turned damsel, are here,\" Horace adds, watching me. \"It ain’t right. But then, right’s hardly got a say in how things turn out, does it?\"\n\nSilence hangs between us, thick and heavy. The faint melody of wind chimes fills the quiet.\n\n\"I suppose not,\" I concede softly.\n\n\"Best make the most of it then,\" Horace advises, a rough kindness coloring his tone. \"Fate's a harsh mistress, but she's all we've got to dance with.\"\n\nAs he walks away, the keyring jangling with each step, I'm left in the quiet. Tears gather, blurring my vision as I wipe at them hastily with the back of my hand.

Or at the very least, those who manipulate fate have.\n\nI look over at Snib, still snoring. Grimjaw, Horace, the patrons—they've all played their part in this twisted tale. And here I remain, the hero who saved many, now needing saving more than ever.\n\nA hopeless chuckle escapes me, mournful and soft.

I've stressed the necessity of discretion in this project, yet here we are, dealing with your antics at the castle. It has been... infuriating.\"\n\nThe goblin shrinks slightly under the wizard's rebuke. \"It ain't my fault! She—\" Snib jerks a thumb at me, \"—couldn't handle a simple task.\"\n\nZephyrion ignores his excuses. \"The collateral from your little misadventure has set back our operations.\"\n\nThere’s a palpable tension in the room.\n\n\"And let’s clarify one thing,\" he adds in a ominously quiet tone, \"being housed here is more gracious than you deserve, creature.

It involves the spiraling extraction of essence—a slow, rotting decay of body while the soul shatters. Days of excruciating pain, ending in nothingness.\"\n\nThe wizard raises a hand, and the air thickens ominously. A small vortex of dark energy forms, swirling menacingly.\n\n\"The collar is sensitive to threats,\" he adds quietly, the threat hanging heavy like a guillotine blade. \"I am certain I could stir up its energies if I gave you a little more... motivation.\"\n\nFear flickers in Snib's eyes—a rare sight. He nods, understanding the gravity of Zephyrion's words.\n\n\"Good,\" Zephyrion concludes, the vortex dissipating with a flick of his wrist. \"Keep it under control. And Elise,\" he turns to me, his gaze piercing, \"stay out of the public eye.\"\n\nWith that, the wizard turns sharply on his heel and exits the room, his robes sweeping behind him, leaving a heavy silence in his wake.[Choice: Snib is not happy.",

Just this morning’s—”\n\nGiles silences him with a dismissive wave. “I’m not here in an official capacity. Today, I have business with the goblin.”\n\nSnib’s eyes narrow. Without a word, he rises and follows Captain Giles toward a side room, disappearing behind the heavy, creaking door.\n\nWhile the murmurs of the remaining patrons and girls fill the brothel, I stand in line with the other prostitutes. The unease gnaws at me as I wait, my body tense and on edge.\n\nThe muted voices on the other side of the closed door draw my attention. I lean slightly, straining to catch snippets of their conversation.\n\nSnib chuckles darkly. \"...know it'll work out fer ya, Captain.\"\n\nGiles’s voice, low and hard, responds, \"...we get you out, and it's done. She has no place here...\"\n\nSnib's voice again, “...better stay hidden, wizard’s nose in everything...”\n\nThere’s a pause, then a few more indistinguishable murmurs before the door opens, and Giles steps out.\n\nHorace fidgets nervously as Giles approaches him. \"Captain, is there anything amiss?\"\n\nGiles’ eyes flick to me, “Not at all, Horace. Just out of curiosity, what would it cost me for a night with this particular whore?”\n\nThe room falls silent, the air thick with tension.\n\nHorace hesitates, looking over at me and then back to Giles. \"Captain, I... well, err... that's... Elise is new, so maybe—\"\n\nGiles cuts him off, his voice curt and commanding, \"Name your price.\"\n\nThe weight of his gaze pins me in place, and heat rises in my cheeks, burning with an amalgamation of shame and fear. It feels like the floor beneath me is about to give way. It’s one thing to be here, debased among the shadows and anonymity of strangers. But to be judged and bartered by someone who once stood beside me on the battlefield, who knows my wife...\n\nHorace, visibly flustered, finally stammers, “F-fifty gold, Captain.”\n\n“I think not,” Giles retorts icily. “More like twenty.”\n\n“Captain, surely—”\n\nGiles’ eyes harden, and with a motion, he flicks a gold coin from his pouch, watching it roll and stop near Horace's foot. His voice drops, quieter yet cutting through the air, making it feel heavy. \"Don't worry, old man. I'm not here to disrupt your operations. My business tonight is... personal.\"\n\nHorace’s gaze shifts between Giles and me, trying to read the undercurrents of intent in the Captain’s cold eyes. “Very well, Captain,” he relents.\n\nGiles strides over to me, his presence consuming the room’s oxygen. I stand motionless, terror tightening my chest as he takes my arm in a firm grip, leading me through the main hall while the patrons and whores watch in weighted silence.\n\nWe make our way to one of the brothel rooms, and with every step, the stone walls close in, the atmosphere around us growing denser. Giles shuts the door behind us, his cold hand still gripping my arm, guiding me towards the bed.\n\nThe room is furnished with the typical trappings of a brothel—plush cushions, draped curtains, the faint scent of incense masking the underlying odor of sweat and lust. But the familiar details take on a dark, foreboding tone in the presence of the Captain.\n\nGiles takes a deep breath, loosening the leather straps of his armor, leaning in close; the intensity in his gaze piercing through me.\n\n“Ever wonder why you never really see all the edges of a person, Elise?” he murmurs, his voice low and dangerous. “Some... have seen my noble side.” [Choice: What's going on?",

There is a tension in his movements, a restrained ferocity as he discards his worn garments piece by piece.\n\n\"I've worked out a deal with Snib,\" he states flatly, as he steps out of his trousers. \"Tonight, he takes you back to the wilderness, out of Zephyrion’s reach.

I clamber onto the bed, my movements awkward.\n\nI hear the crinkle of a condom wrapper and a low chuckle from Giles. \"No sense getting whatever diseases you’ve picked up from that goblin.\"\n\nHis fingers toy with the thin strings on my hips before moving higher, tracing the curve of my waist.\n\n\"Elara will move on,\" he murmurs, his voice almost gentle now, an underlying edge of bitterness sharpening each word. \"She'll see you've abandoned her and she'll realize her husband is dead and buried.

I'm going to enjoy this.\"\n\nClimbing onto the bed, his muscular body casts an imposing shadow over me, a dark silhouette that sends a shiver of anticipation and fear down my spine. He presses a hand on my lower back, making me arch, causing my ass to lift up, pushing my tits into the soft bed.\n\n\"You ready to be my bitch?\" he asks, the question more of a statement.\n\nI close my eyes tightly, bracing myself as I nod.

The impact sends a wave of pain and pleasure mixed together, the sound of his body hitting mine—a series of loud *SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP*—echoing in the room.\n\nMy body rocks with each violent thrust, tits jiggling with the motion, the bed creaking under us.\n\n\"Hah! Haah! Haah! Oh, fuck!\"\n\n-SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP-\n\n“DO YOU EVEN LOVE HER ANYMORE?” Giles growls, bending over my back, his voice hot against my ear.\n\n\"UGH... I... I do...\" I whimper, trying to form coherent thoughts.\n\n\"DO YOU!?\" He demands, his hand coming down hard on my ass, the spank loud and stinging. \"Do you even care about her? Do you know she’s pregnant? Do you even remember?\"\n\nThe sting making me yelp. “Aah! Ahhn! Ahhn!”\n\n*CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP*\n\nThe spanks rain down, each one snapping against my skin, inflaming it further.\n\n“Do you even really care about her??”\n\n\"O-oohhh!!\" I sob, my breaths quick and shallow. My cunt spasms agianst his unyielding cock.\n\n**\"ANSWER ME!\"** His shout is almost a roar.\n\n\"YES! Yes, I l- love her!\" Tears blur my vision, sobs catching in my throat as I try to answer him. Each thrust pushes the breath out of me.\n\nGiles pulls my hair back sharply, causing my head to arch, my breasts swinging and flopping painfully.\n\n“O-oooh!” I gasp as he *RIPS* off my bikini top, baring my heaving chest. My massive nipples are painfully erect\n\n\"You don't deserve her!\" he screams, his voice cracking. \"Not like I do!\"\n\n“Ngghaa~ oohhh!! Hah, hah!” My vocalizations are high-pitched and nasally, every thrust sending jolts of forced ecstasy through me.\n\n“DO YOU LOVE HER?!! OR DO YOU LOVE THE GOBLIN MORE?!!” Giles’s voice breaks, anger and something else—a bitter sorrow—bleeding through.\n\nEach thrust sends a lewd *shcuuullp* through the air, my slick, drenched pussy offering no resistance as he drills me without mercy. The combined scent of sex and sweat fills the room, overwhelming me, my body betraying my mind as pleasure coiled tighter within me.\n\nThe intrusive thoughts of Snib’s cock and the degrading pleasures he’s given invade my mind, fogging my memories. Giles’ voice is a piercing agony against the growing haze, his attempts to break me down near the edge.",

I... I can't...\"\n\nGiles pulls my hair harder, snapping my head back, the pain mingling with a masochistic pleasure I can't ignore anymore.\n\nIn that moment, the image of Snib invades my mind. His grotesque, grinning face, those dirty hands exploring every intimate part of me—claiming me, owning me. The way he can make my body sing with a single touch or command...\n\nAnd Giles’ earlier words...\n\n“DO YOU LOVE HER?!! OR DO YOU LOVE THE GOBLIN MORE?!!”\n\nI break. I fucking shatter.\n\n“H-HIM! SNIB! I love Snib!” My voice is a cracked scream, raw and broken. I don't even know where the words come from, only that they're the vile truth. “I serve Snib! I love his big *gobbo cock*!! Unghh, haa~!”\n\nGiles’ hand crashes down on my ass, each spank a punishing blow to my delicate flesh.\n\n*CRACK* *WHAP* *SMACK*\n\n“Traitor! You’re a fucking traitor!” Giles roars, each word punctuated with a brutal thrust or a fiery spank. “To your wife, your *child*, and the human race!”\n\n“Mnnnghhh~!” I slobber and sob. “He makes me cum with commands! I obey him more each day, not just ‘cause of the collar, but because I *HAAAaaannngh~* love him!”\n\nMy cries are ragged and wet, my voice breaking under the weight of my confession.\n\n*THWACK! SMAK! SMAK!*\n\nGiles' cock rams into me, pistoning relentlessly, his own fury feeding into every savage thrust.\n\n“I-I deserve it! I deserve to be fucked by him! I’m his bitch, his slut!” I wail, my eyes rolling back. The intense pleasure mixes with the shame, my body responding against my will, my vagina clenching around Giles’ invading cock. “I love his *huge, veiny cock*! I-I don’t deserve anything else!”\n\nAnother series of brutal thrusts, his hips crashing into my ass, making it jiggle obscenely. He’s relentless, each movement a statement of his dominance—and my utter submission.\n\n“You’re no hero,” he spits, his voice dripping with disdain. “You’re a fucking monster. And that’s exactly where you belong—among them. You don’t even deserve to breathe the same air as decent folk.”\n\nHis fingers dig into my hips, leaving bruises as his cock stretches me. My tears stream down my cheeks, drenching the velvet whorehouse pillow.\n\n“Giles, please… Oh, gods, I... I can’t...”\n\n“Shut up,” he snarls, slamming into me with relentless brutality. “Don’t you dare speak to me. You’re not even human anymore.”\n\nEach thrust pushes me closer to the edge, the pleasure mounting, cresting, about to break.\n\n“N-no, please… I...”\n\n\"You're fucking nothing. A waste. A pathetic fuck-toy.\"\n\n“Ohhh, fuck... *UNNGHHHH!*” My orgasm crashes over me like a wave of pure agony and ecstasy, my pussy convulsing around Giles’ punishing girth, milking his cock desperately. My screams echo off the walls.\n\nGiles gives a final, savage thrust, his cock buried deep inside me. He stays there, his breath harsh against my neck, the final degradation in the silence that follows.\n\n“You’ll be exactly where you belong,” he whispers.[Choice: He cums.]\"Mmmph—Her! Always... her!\" My voice is barely coherent, muffled by my tears and the overwhelming physicality of his assault.\n\nGiles' grip on my hair tightens, yanking my head back further, his movements growing even more aggressive, desperate to break something inside me with his questions, with his violent accusations.\n\n\"Prove it!\" he shouts, shaking me with the ferocity of his grip, his hips still slamming into me, relentless and cruel. \"Say her name! Admit it to yourself!\"\n\nThe bed rocks with each savage thrust, the sound of our bodies slapping together filling the room, each impact a brutal reminder of my situation.\n\nLogical thought slips away under the crush of physical domination and mental turmoil, each harsh thrust blurring the line between pain and pleasure. Deep down, something primal, something fiercely protective stirs—a reminder of who I am, who I was.\n\n\"I love her!\" I scream, the admission tearing from deep within me, raw and honest amid the tarnish of my current life. \"Elara—oh gods, Elara!\"\n\n“That’s a lie!” he growls, his voice rough with anger. “You don’t belong to her anymore! You’re nothing but a goblin’s bitch!”\n\n“NO! I love her! I LOVE HER!” The words pour out, driven by a desperate need to cling to my humanity.\n\n“Say her name again!” he snarls, his thrusts growing even more brutal. “Prove it!”\n\n“Elara! Oh gods, Elara! I love you!” I cry, my voice breaking with the intensity of my emotions. Tears stream down my cheeks, mingling with the sweat slicking my body. Every fiber of my being clings to her memory, her touch, her love.\n\nGiles shakes me harder, his grip almost painful. “You think you’re worthy of her? You think you can protect her? Prove it!”\n\n\"I— Elara! I’m sorry! I’m so sorry, I love you! I love you so much!” The words are a mantra now, echoing in the room, defying the humiliation and pain.\n\nGiles’ face contorts with rage and something close to desperation. His thrusts turn erratic, each movement accentuated with a rough, harsh grunt. “Say it again! Say it like you mean it!”\n\n“Elara! I love you! Always you, never anyone else!” I gasp, the intensity of my feelings mingling with the physical sensation coursing through me.\n\nHis cock pulses harder within me, the rough friction igniting every nerve. The pressure builds, coiling tighter and tighter in my core.\n\n“Elara! Elara! Elara!” I scream, my voice raw with emotion, torn from deep within me, even as I cum.\n\nMy orgasm washes over me in a violent surge of ecstasy and despair. My pussy clenches around Giles’ thrusting cock, milking him with each spasm as my body shudders uncontrollably.\n\nGiles’ own climax is brutal, his hips slamming into me one last time, driving him deep as he spills into the condom. His breath is ragged against my neck, his grip on my hair loosening slightly.\n\nI’m left gasping, tears streaming down my cheeks, my body trembling with the aftershocks of the orgasm. My voice is a hoarse whisper as I repeat, “I love her... I love... Elara...” over and over, a desperate plea to keep the fragile thread of my humanity intact.[Choice: Giles collapses next to you.]",

My body still trembles with the aftershocks of my forced orgasm, the raw vulnerability leaving me shivering despite the heat.\n\nGiles sighs deeply\n\n“We can’t go on like this,” he says. “I wanted to break you. To show you how far you’ve fallen. But... maybe it’s not too late.”\n\nHe lifts his head, his eyes meeting mine, filled with a profound weariness.\n\n“You want to regain your honor? There’s one way... one final chance.”\n\nI listen, my breath catching in my throat as he continues.\n\n“As long as Snib lives and Zephyrion is around to exploit your misery, Elara's life is at risk. The wizard’s plans—what he’s doing with that collar—it ends with death. It ends with awakening ancient gods.”\n\nI feel that his words are true.\n\n“There’s only one choice,” Giles says, his voice firm, yet tinged with regret. “To kill Snib. But... you know, as well as I do... if Snib dies, the collar will kill you too. It’s designed that way—to protect its... master.”\n\nI tremble, clutching the sheets with white-knuckled hands.\n\nGiles reaches out, gently resting a hand on my shoulder. “There is no other way, Elise. This... all of this will spiral into greater disaster. Zephyrion’s plans endanger everything. Re-awakening Maraan... it will bring chaos, death, destruction on a scale we can’t imagine.”\n\nHe takes a deep breath, swallowing hard.\n\n“I don’t want to kill you; even after everything, I can’t bring myself to do it. But allowing this to continue is something I can’t accept either.”\n\nHis voice softens, a pleading tone underlying his words.\n\n“If you agree... if you see that this is the only path, I will end the goblin. I will tell Elara that you made this choice for her, for us all. She will cry over you, mourn you, but she will understand. She will see it as the last brave act of Aldric, the man, the hero.”\n\nThe weight of his plea crushes me.\n\nCan I... let go of the desperate hope, the small flicker of resistance that keeps me clinging to this cursed life?\n\nGiles’ grip on my shoulder tightens, grounding me. “Please,” he whispers. “Do this for her. Let this nightmare end.”\n\nI close my eyes, feeling the tears slip down my face. I open my mouth to speak, my voice trembling.",

I’ll tell Elara you chose this, that it was your last act of heroism. When your child grows, I’ll tell them what a hero their father was, your final act. If Elara accepts me as her husband, I promise to care for her, to honor your memory.”\n\nI nod, tears streaking my face, the enormity of what I’ve agreed to weighing heavily on my heart.\n\nGiles stands, adjusting his clothing before calling out, his voice carrying a commanding authority.\n\n“Snib! Bring yourself in here. Your whore isn’t listening!”\n\nThe door creaks open, and Snib bursts into the room, snarling. “What’s this about?”\n\nHe glances between us, sensing the tension. “Getting in the way of my plans again, eh, titcow? Useless slut.\"\n\nI bite my lip, forcing myself to stay silent, every instinct screaming to warn my master, but Giles’ calm, prepared demeanor keeps me grounded.\n\nSnib steps forward, grabbing my arm harshly. “You ain’t goin’ anywhere, 'cept where I say,” he hisses. “And if ye don’t keep in line, well, you know how I deal with disobedience.”\n\n“You’re getting out of this town, and you’d best go along with it. We’ve got plans, you and me.” *THWACK*\n\n“Ugh... Master... please...” I force out, my voice strained.\n\nGiles moves silently behind Snib, retrieving a dagger from his leather satchel. The weight of the moment bears down, and time seems to slow as he approaches.\n\nSnib’s hand tightens on my hair. “Oh, you’ll enjoy it, won’t ye? Big adventures...”\n\nHe starts, realizing Giles’ proximity, turning partway to hiss, “Back off, Captain. This is between me and my bitch.”\n\nBut Giles’ hand darts out, gripping Snib’s neck with steely strength. The goblin’s eyes widen in shock and confusion as Giles forces the dagger into my hand, his grip sure and unyielding.\n\n“End it,” Giles whispers fiercely to me, “Do it now.” He likely knows I cannot bring myself to kill my master of my own accord, but gives me the chance anyway.\n\nWith my fingers wrapped around the cold handle, the captain guides my hand in a swift, brutal motion, the dagger plunging deep into Snib’s chest. The goblin’s eyes widen further, his mouth opening in a silent scream.\n\nFor a moment, everything is still. The room is filled with the heavy scent of iron, the sound of our ragged breathing.\n\nSnib’s grip on my hair loosens, his eyes meeting mine.\n\n“You...” he wheezes, blood bubbling at his lips. “You bitch...”\n\nHis body collapses, and I feel the resistance of muscle and bone giving way. Every fiber of my being screams to pull the dagger out, to withdraw from this terrifying reality, but I hold steady, keeping it in place, sealing his fate.\n\nThe collar around my neck tightens, instantly reading the life force draining from its master. It constricts painfully, cutting off my air, my vision tunneling as I struggle to draw breath.\n\nMy body seizes, muscles locking as the collar’s magic fights desperately to protect its bond. The pressure builds in my skull, pain lancing through my spine.\n\nI fall beside Snib’s lifeless form, my neck breaking under the relentless grip.\n\nIn those final moments, memories flood my mind—Elara’s smile, her laughter, our unborn child. The life we planned, the home we wanted to build. I was Aldric, the hero who protected Eboncrest. And in this last act, I have freed them from this darkness.\n\nMay Elara live free and safe, remembering the love we shared, and the hero I tried to be until the end.\n\n(:\"17 bigger choice\",17,\"You died, but you died a hero.\")]I can’t bring myself to accept Giles’ offer, no matter how much sense it makes, no matter how desperate the situation.

I can’t do it. I can’t...”\n\nGiles’ expression hardens. “That’s what I thought.”\n\nHe pulls away from me, standing up and dressing silently, his movements are quick and efficient. Once he’s fully clothed, he signals to his men waiting outside.\n\nThey enter the room, their faces blank.\n\n“Get them ready,” Giles orders.\n\nThe guards move with practiced precision, binding my hands and securing Snib, who already snickers with anticipation.\n\n“Back to freedom, eh?” Snib’s voice is gleeful as they push me toward him. “Good riddance, this place was gettin’ boring.”\n\nWe’re led through the gloom of the brothel’s back corridors, the shadows dancing eerily on the walls.[Choice: You're brought outside.]",

His cock throbs violently inside me, every vein bulging as he approaches climax. His face is twisted with a mixture of satisfaction and hatred, and his eyes bore into mine with a cold, almost clinical disdain.\n\n“You make me *sick*,” he snarls as he pounds me hard.\n\n*SPANK*\n\n“AHN!

Utter disgrace.”\n\nHe dresses himself briskly, donning his armor with deliberate, angry motions. There’s no further semblance of pity or empathy in his gaze—only contempt.\n\n“Elara will be with someone better,” he spits, fastening his breastplate. “I’ll raise your child—and have some of my own.

Striding to the door, he calls to his men with a tone that brooks no argument.\n\n“Bring in the new outfit.”\n\nThe guards enter, their expressions unreadable, though I can sense the shared disdain and amusement at my predicament. They throw a skimpier, degrading outfit onto the bed beside me. It’s made of barely-there leather straps and thin metal ornaments.\n\n“Get dressed,” they order, clearly taking no pleasure in making sure it’s tight, binding at the waist to emphasize the soft curve of my hips and ass.\n\nWith trembling hands, I comply, fingers fumbling with the absurdly scant costume.

As we reach a small gate, Giles nods at the guards stationed there.\n\n“We saw nothin’,” one of them mutters, allowing us through without question.\n\nWe're reunited with Jarkrond, Snib's desert horse.

Lucky days,\" he mutters, eyeing my milk-laden breasts with greedy eyes.\n\nSettling myself on a makeshift stool, I expose my massive teats fully, allowing my hands to guide each goblin to a feeding position. As Snib latches onto my left nipple and Grot onto my right, shivers of pleasure shoot through me—my body instinctively ready to provide sustenance to my owner. Each tug and suck sends waves of delirious satisfaction coursing through my veins.\n\n“You both look so stressed,” I murmur. My voice is filled with genuine concern and subservience, all traces of independence and resistance long obliterated.\n\nAs they suckle impatiently, their sharp teeth grazing against my sensitive skin, I reach down with both hands, guiding my small, soft fingers around their twitching cocks. I begin to pump gently, the familiar sensation of their hard lengths fitting perfectly in my grip.\n\n“Unghhh, good cow…” Snib mumbles around my nipple, milk dribbling down his chin. Grot’s echoed agreement is a mumble of contentment as he bobs his head, sucking hungrily, his eyes half-lidded with pleasure.\n\nThe tent is filled with the wet, rhythmic sounds of their suckling and my desperate, aroused breathing. There's no distinction between their pleasure and mine; my body exists solely to serve, to be used. The heat is intense—part desert, part lust—and the discomfort is minuscule beside the waves of ecstasy each obedient action brings.\n\n“You’ve trained her well, Snib,” Grot comments, his words distorted by the fat nipple in his mouth. “This is top-quality milk. Creamy delight.”\n\nSnib chuckles, releasing my nipple with a wet *pop*. “Told ya, Grot.”\n\nMy pulse quickens, pride blooming like a mini-orgasm. This is my purpose, my joy. My thoughts drift hazily over the realization that any vestiges of humanity are long gone, eroded by months of sheer, degrading bliss.\n\nMy wife has forgotten me; and I’ve forgotten her.\n\n“That right, pet?

My eyes flutter and cross slightly, drool pooling at the corners of my lips as my hygiene and dignity dissolve beneath their touch.\n\nI jerk both of them off rhythmically, my nimble fingers gliding along their thick, veiny cocks. The throbbing flesh pulses with a life of its own, heating under my touch. Their low, goblin grunts mix with the slurping sounds of my milk being hungrily drawn from me.\n\n“New tent plans, y'think?\" Grot asks, his mouth muffled by my ample tit-flesh, sucking on my fat nipple like a hungry babe.\n\n“If we can,\" Snib mutters. “She’ll pop soon. Triplets, ye see.\"\n\nI smile, my head bobbing slightly, a dazed laugh escaping me. “Yes, Master… I’m carryin’ your pups…” My voice is proud, worshipful. Each comment makes me glisten with gratitude and arousal.\n\nTheir conversation continues as if I'm part of the furniture. \"We stay 'ere 'til she births 'em,\" Snib continues. \"No sense movin' when the whelps could come any day now.\"\n\n“Mnnnghh~ yes, let’s stay,\" I agree mindlessly. I can't remember the last time I disagreed with anything he's said.\n\nThe sucking intensifies, each draw of milk sending bolts of pleasure directly to my cunt. \"Uunnghh~ g'job, Masters! Feelin’ so good~!”\n\n“Not like she’ll give us grief,” Grot chuckles, a wet smack as he pauses, licking his lips. “Too far gone. Only serves us now.”\n\nTheir cocks swell in my hands, almost as if they’re ready to burst.\n\n“Hnnnn... s-so thick...! Suck me g-good, Masters!” I cry out, the sensations pushing me toward my peak.\n\nThe heady scent of their pre-cum fills the air, a scent both musky and addictive. My mouth waters, remembering my true purpose.\n\n“Masters…” I mumble, mouth full of want. “Lemme drink too, please~”\n\nGrot chuckles, his greasy fingers sinking into my hair, guiding me down.\n\nI eagerly part my lips, accepting each of their cocks in turn.\n\nThe sensation of Grot’s cock in my mouth, thick and hot, is like home. With a delighted moan, I start to suck him off, my head bobbing in a degrading rhythm, feeling his length glide smoothly over my eager tongue. My free breast hangs heavily, milk still dribbling.\n\n“Be quick about it,” Snib comments idly. “Give it to her, Grot.”\n\n“Gah, she’s got quite the suction, hasn’t she? Ready to give her a good drink, I am!”\n\nAs he says this, I feel his cock swell in my mouth, the veins throbbing more pronouncedly. My eyes roll back slightly; anticipation courses through me. *This is it.*\n\n“Here comes your nourishment,” Grot groans as he holds my head firmly.\n\nThe first jet of his cum rockets into my mouth, thick and copious. It splashes against the back of my throat, and I swallow eagerly, savoring the creamy, rich texture.\n\n*So delicious...*\n\nEach pulse of his seed feels like a reward, the fulfilling end to a task well done.\n\n“*GLUCK*... *GLUCK*... *GLUCK*…” The sounds fill the tent as I drink down his load, my body responding with its own release. A spray of my arousal squirts onto the dusty floor from between my thighs, a physical testament to the depth of my debasement and pleasure.\n\nSnib watches, a twisted smirk on his lips. “Told ya she’d love it. Watch this, she’ll go wild for mine too.”\n\nOnce Grot steps back, spent, Snib steps forward, his erection bobbing eagerly. “Open up, pet.”\n\nI don’t hesitate. My mouth opens wide, welcoming him in like a long-lost lover. As Snib feeds me his cock, the familiarity of his girth makes my heart race. I suck him with fervor, hands gently kneading his heavy balls, coaxing the load I crave.\n\nSnib and Grot continue their conversation as if I’m merely a piece of usable furniture at their disposal.\n\n“Think we’ll hit the northern trails tomorrow?” Snib muses, thrusting into my mouth.\n\n“Might be good, yeah. Heard there’s a settlement needs checking. Could be good pickins',” Grot replies.\n\nAs they talk, I focus on Snib, feeling his orgasm build. The tightening of his balls under my fingers, the quickening of his thrusts—each sign sends a thrill through me.\n\nWith a low growl, Snib holds my head still. “Drink it all, cow. My special brew.”\n\nHis cum floods my mouth, thicker and even more abundant than Grot’s. I swallow reflexively, the *GLUCK* *GLUCK* sounds rhythmic, almost soothing. It’s warmth spreads through me, a perverse kind of satisfaction filling me as I drink every last drop.\n\n“Ah, there we go... good girl,” Snib pants, finally spent. He pats my head, almost affectionately. “Keeps her quiet, this does.”\n\nI lick my lips, catching the last remnants of his taste. “Thank you, Master... so filling.”\n\nThe simplicity of the arrangement, the base exchange of bodily fluids for mutual sustenance—it’s my reality now, stripped of complexity or moral quandary.[Choice: This is your life now.",

ENJOY.\n\nI drink down multiple loads of goblin sperm a day, my body craving it as much as it craves water or food. The thick, potent seed is a lifeline, each gulp reinforcing the bond between me and my masters. My milk, sweet and nourishing, flows freely for Snib, a perpetual giver and sustainer of life - as it will for his pups.\n\nOur symbiotic bond is a loop ensuring my compliance and their control. Each cycle of feeding and drinking deepens that bond, tightening the invisible chains that bind me to them. The hormonal balance is perfectly maintained, solidifying my role as a devoted pet.\n\nOver time, my behavior has morphed into something almost... goblin-like. I feel my mind slipping into simple, primal pleasures. Resistance isn't just futile—it’s forgotten. A faint memory of an unrecognizable time.\n\nDrool escapes from the corner of my lips as I giggle, kneeling before my masters, their conversation floating around me as if I don't exist as a sentient being anymore, merely a vessel for their desires.\n\n“Think we’ll strike ‘round moonrise,” Snib muses, while tearing apart a piece of dried meat. Grot nods, adding, “Aye. Heard the northern tribe’s sending extra warriors.”\n\nI hum softly as I help prepare the desert fowl they hunted. My hands work deftly, gutting and plucking the bird with ease. The sensation of the fresh catch, the smell of the feathers—this is my place, my purpose. I take satisfaction in my servitude.\n\nOccasionally, my swollen belly ripples, a gentle tremor beneath my skin—a reminder of the next generation of goblins growing inside me. The little kicks fuel a sense of maternal joy, each flutter an affirmation of my role as their incubator.\n\nI giggle again, feeling another particularly strong kick. “They’re active, Masters. Eager to join ya on yer next hunt.”\n\nSnib chuckles, ruffling my hair. \"Good. Strong whelps.\"\n\nAs I prepare the meal, the goblins talk of raids on human villages. But I barely pay attention or feel anything, other than wonder when Snib will be back.\n\nContentment suffuses me, a blissful, obedient haze clouding my mind as I serve the fowl, laying it out on the rough-spun cloth that serves as our dining table. The simplicity of knowing my role, of being utterly subservient, fills me with a tranquility I’m too far gone to question.\n\nWith a gentle caress of my swollen belly, I giggle again, feeling my pups squirm and kick, their presence a warm comfort. The grotesque beauty of my reality is complete, a dark harmony of surrender, pleasure, and service.\n\n(:\"17 alone\",17,\"You've been made into Snib's broodmama!

Slowly, she lifts the dress, revealing the bodice beneath that clings to her slender, curvaceous form.

If it means learning to get along with you too, Master Snib, then so be it.”\n\nThe words stir something deep within, mingling the haze with a disturbing sense of satisfaction. I’m not as torn up as I might have been without the goblin pheromones clouding my mind.\n\n“Mmn, see, she knows her place,” Snib mutters, squeezing Elara’s ass harder. Then, turning his gaze to me, he sneers.\n\nElara nods dreamily, turning her attention to me with a serene, almost trance-like smile. “Let’s get into a bath. It’ll be good for us, Elise. It seems you haven't been taking them while I've been gone.”\n\nI nod, unable to resist the compulsion, the strange mixture of pleasure and haze melding my thoughts together.

He has shown us our true selves.”\n\n“True selves?” I echo, my voice filled with bitter disbelief. “Elara, this isn’t you! Listen to yourself.

Her hands work deftly, ensuring everything is perfect for Snib.\n\nThe goblin sneers at me, lounging nearby, “Look at her, so eager to please a real man.”\n\nAs the tub fills, she fetches a large ceramic jug filled with fragrant oils, pouring them into the bath. The scents of lavender and rosemary mingle with the steam, wrapping around us like a cloak. She stirs the water slowly, the oils streaking the surface like paint on a canvas.\n\n\"Get in, Master,\" she coos to Snib, her fingers hooking into the sides of his filthy loincloth. With a delicate tug, she pulls it down, and his flaccid cock flops out, swinging between his legs like a lewd pendulum. My wife helps him into the bath, her hands gentle but deliberate.\n\nOnce Snib is seated in the steaming water, Elara starts to wash him. She dips a rough sponge into the soapy water and begins running it over his wart-covered back.

She rinses him off, the clear water cascading down his thick, veiny cock, and Snib groans appreciatively.\n\n\"Bigger than that husband of yours ever was, eh?” he mocks, his yellow eyes gleaming with a cruel satisfaction directed at me. \"Now look at you, all swollen and soakin' yer panties over there, watching your wife tend to a goblin like she was born fer it.\"\n\nI watch as her fingers wrap around its girth as she delicately runs a soapy cloth along its length.

It's a heavy musk that fills my nostrils, mixing with the fragrant oils but never quite covered.

It’s almost cute, how desperate you are.”\n\nHer words, laced with a bizarre mix of derision and affection, leave me feeling utterly conflicted and helplessly aroused.\n\nShe reaches across my lap, her delicate fingers wrapping around Snib’s thick, pulsing cock. She begins to stroke him, slow and deliberate, each movement causing his ugly lips to twitch.\n\nSnib chuckles, a low, menacing sound as his hands roam over my massive tits, squeezing the pliant flesh with rough, eager palms. \"Maybe I'll let you kiss your missus, but only if you’re a good girl.\"\n\nElara's lips hover just inches from mine, her eyes softening with what looks like genuine regret.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Elise... But you really are such a slut for this... It’s hard to believe you were *ever* Aldric. Of course, I know it. But I can't feel it.\"\n\nHer other hand continues to work Snib's shaft. Every stroke sends a new pulse of heat rushing through me, amplified by the way Snib squeezes and fondles my aching breasts.\n\nThe revulsion and arousal are a sickening helix that drives me closer to madness. The hot, scented water swirls around my body, simulating a lover’s caress.\n\n“So, ya wanna kiss yer wife, eh? Give her a good ol’ smooch like ya used to when ya were a big, bad hero?”\n\nI tremble, nodding while a desperate sob escapes my lips.\n\nElara, sitting intimately close, yet worlds apart, whispers with a hint of apology lacing her tone, \"I can only kiss you if Snib allows it, darling.”\n\nSnib chuckles, a sound as coarse and grating as gravel. “Gobbo goo turns human bitches into compliant lil' sluts. Ain’t that right, Elise? It's all swirly and mushy in yer brain right now.”\n\nMy cheeks burn, unable to deny the twisted truth in his vile words.\n\n“I've enjoyed watchin' cow tits here do stuff on her own accord. Beg for it. Gets me fuckin' hard, seein’ Aldric the so-called Great becoming a gobbo-lovin’ whore.”\n\nThe steam in the tub seems to ripple as if driven by the *force* of his wickedness.\n\n\"Ya see, most gobbos, they just snatch, fuck, and fill human women up like mindless twats. But me?\" His grin widened into a smirk, a layer of predatory satisfaction in his eyes. \"I like to get creative. I love watchin’ me prey turn themselves into puddles, bit by bit.\"\n\nHe strokes his gnarled fingers across my cheek, oily and humid from the water. I'm too frozen, too hollowed out to recoil.\n\n\"Makes a goblin's cock hard, knowin' I broke a gobbo butcher. Not just his body, nah — his *pride*, his feckin' spirit!” Snib chortles. He squeezes my nipple harshly. \"Ya used to be Aldric the *fucking* Great, slashin' through me kin. And now? You’re just a cum-begging, tit-jigglin' cow. It’s fuckin' hilarious.\"\n\nElara watches him, her voice threaded with unnerving curiosity. \"So, you enjoy watching Elise degrade herself? Watching her bargain her dignity for scraps?\"\n\n\"Fuck yes!\" Snib guffaws. \"It's the best bit! It’s way hotter making her justify it all to herself. Like, 'Ooh, if I do this little thing, I can kiss my precious wife.' It's fuckin' gold!\"\n\nElara turns to me, her voice soft but carrying a disturbing note of fascination.\n\n\"Did you ever consider, Elise... if you knew goblins were sentient, smarter than you, like Snib... would you have slain so many?\"\n\nHer fingers trace the rim of my ear, sending a shiver down my spine.\n\n\"He could've just taken you, made you a gobbo's broodmare from the get-go. But look at this care he’s shown. He enjoys seeing you embrace your nature, your place. Isn’t it better to submit willingly?\"\n\nMY wife leans in closer, her breath warm against my ear, her voice dropping to a seductive murmur.\n\n\"I want to see it, Elise. I want to see you fully give in, beg for it. Show us that you understand your new role, that you're no longer the hero, just another needy slut aching for her Master’s approval.\"",

Look at you.\" Her hand moves to cup one of my huge breasts, her touch feather-light but provoking a sudden, hot rush of arousal. \"You say it's not right, but your body tells a different story. It's been telling one since the moment you first transformed. You're so *gosh-darn* wet, aren’t you?\"\n\nMy cheeks burn with shame. \"That’s not fair, Elara. I... I didn't choose this!\"\n\nShe lets out a haughty laugh, her fingers tweaking my stiff nipple, sending jolts of pleasure through me. \"Of course, you didn’t. But look at where we are. Look at who’s in control.\" Her eyes flash with something dangerous, predatory. \"Snib is a real man. He takes what he wants, and unlike you, he doesn’t hesitate.\"\n\nHer words slice deep. I try to pull away, a feeble attempt to regain some semblance of dignity, but her grip tightens on my nipple, making me gasp in a mix of pain and pleasure.\n\n\"Don't you dare try to resist,\" she hisses, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. \"You belong to him now. And more than anything, you belong here, on your knees, begging for whatever scraps of attention he deigns to give you.\"\n\nHer words mix with the fog of the goblin's pheromones that cloud my mind, turning the icy pang of mortification into something confusingly hot and irresistible. Somewhere in the haze, I realize Elara has moved, presenting me with a clear view of Snib’s grotesque, throbbing cock — its veiny girth bobbing in the steamy water, oozing a slick, clear drop at the tip.\n\nI try to tear my eyes away, but Elara's voice, now sweet and lilting, draws my gaze back with irresistible force. \"Look at him, Elise. Look at his cock.\"\n\nMy breath catches, the wetness between my thighs intensifying. I choke back a sob as I cannot deny the truth. Her hand slides sensuously down her own belly, dipping between her legs, massaging herself with slow, deliberate strokes.\n\n\"You already broke our wedding vows with him, Elise. It’s high time I got to watch.\"\n\nSnib is eating this up. \"She's right, cow tits. Yer just a wet, hungry hole waitin' to be filled.\"\n\nElara grips my chin, forcing me to look directly at Snib’s pulsating cock. The hot steam rises around us, a glowing mist in which our world is narrowed down to this lurid circus of taboo pleasures.\n\n\"Say it, Elise,\" she demands, her voice harsh and commanding, obliterating what little remained of the strong, capable woman I once knew. \"Beg him to fuck you raw. Tell him he’s a real man, and you’re just a needy, dripping pussy. Only then will I let you kiss me. Only then will we all be complete.\"]Steam curls languidly around us in the dimly lit room, the heavy scent of musk mingling with the floral tones of the bath oils. Elara’s sapphire eyes lock onto mine, a mixture of lust and a strange, taunting pity shimmering within them. Her lips, swollen and bitten from Snib's recent kiss, are slick and slightly parted, inviting yet mocking.\n\n\"Don't you want to kiss me, Elise? Kiss your own wife,\" Elara teases, her voice a sultry whisper that carves into my aching heart. \"It hurts my feelings if you don't want to kiss me.\" She pouts exaggeratedly, her fingertips tracing the wet contour of her lips.\n\nI shiver. \"I... I do,\" I stammer.\n\n\"Look at 'er, all needy an' desperate. What ye gonna do for a kiss from yer precious wife, hero turned whore?\"\n\nElara's eyes twinkle with a fierce intensity.\n\n*She's so far gone... I may as well join her...*\n\n\"Well, Elise, what will you do for me? For us?\" Her tone is teasing.\n\nI tremble. \"Anything...\" I choke out. \"Tell me what you want.\"\n\nElara smiles. \"I want you to truly submit, Elise. Last night, Snib told me he used protection, but tonight... you will take him raw. I want to see him fuck you bare, right here, in front of me.\" Her voice drops to a whisper, but it slashes through the fog of my consciousness like a blade. \"Beg for him to fill you up completely, and then... only then, once he has accepted your plea, I will kiss you.\"\n\nThe proposal is vile, yet something dark and twisted flares to life within me. Any desire to resist is getting buried under a complex web of longings and cravings.\n\nMy lips tremble as tears blur my vision. I'm hanging on the edge of an abyss, and with a shaky, sob-laden breath, I plunge into the darkness.[Choice: Beg.",

I see the encouragement in her eyes, the thrill of the depravity in their gleam. \"I...I want your cock... please...\"\n\n\"Not good enough,\" Elara says. \"You need to beg like *need* it. Like the slut you are. Cock more than air. Cum more than water.\"\n\nMy heart pounds in my chest, my pulse throbbing in sync with the relentless throb between my legs.\n\n\"Snib... fuck me... with your fat, goblin cock. Fuck me like the mindless whore I've become.\"\n\nElara looks at me, wide-eyed. I see a spark of shock in her gaze that quickly shifts to fascination. Snib grunts in amusement.\n\nMy heart races, the degrading words tumbling out of my mouth turning me on in a way I never thought possible.\n\n\"Snib... I need you to wreck my stupid whore pussy...use me like your fucking cock warmer...\"\n\n\"More,” my wife says, her voice quivering.\n\n\"Snib, please...yungh... wreck me!\" I groan, my plea escalating into a needy mewl. \"Slam your huge, goblin cock into my pussy and fucking ruin it! Stretch me out until no human would ever want me! Make me your personal meat toilet!\"\n\nAt this point, I'm moaning with every word. Every word I speak manifests itself in a bodily reaction... I feel my juices drizzling freely down my inner thigh.\n\nWith the pheromones, there is no more subtlety. When I start to say something, I start to mean it.\n\n\"Show yer wife what a pathetic, gobbo-loving slut ye really are!\"\n\nTears trail down my cheeks, hot droplets that blend into the steamy water of the bath. My breath hitches in my throat as I push past my shame, bathing in the warm mud of pure self-degradation.\n\n\"Please, Snib,\" I plead, the words tumbling from my lips like a cascade of filth, \"FUCK my USELESS human cunt. I'm just a WHORE for GOBBO COCK now!\"\n\nElara's eyes shimmer with dark delight.\n\nMy words aren't even intentional anymore. They just flow out.\n\n\"*UNGHHH...* Show Elara how much better you fuck me than I ever fucked her. SHOW her what a REAL MAN fucks like.\"\n\nI'm trembling, the water lapping against my flushed skin with every desperate shift of my body.\n\n\"I want her to SEE it, Snib. I want her to SEE how you MAKE me SCREAM. Let her watch as you BURY that MONSTER COCK in me and make me *FORGET* Aldric ever *EXISTED*!\" I'm nearly shrieking now, each word punctuated by my ragged, panting breaths.\n\nMy mind goes blank, filled only with fevered need.\n\n\"She finally broke,\" Snib grins, his grotesque features twisted in wicked triumph.\n\n\"I'm...I'm your fucking cum dumpster...*yours*...*yours*...only *yours*...only *yours*, Snib! Use me, use ME as your meat toliet, Master Snib! PLEASE!!!\"\n\nChoking back a sob, I gasp my final plea.\n\n\"I...I...AI GUHHHH...*I'M NOTHING WITHOUT YOUR COCK*...PLEASE...*PLEASE-HEE-HEE*... FFFFFFFUUUCK MEEEEE!!!\"\n\nIt's not an act. My whole being throbs with every word.\n\nElara moves closer, her lips brushing against the shell of my ear, her breaths hot and erratic. \"God, Elise, you're such a filthy, dirty whore... and it's so... *so* fucking hot.\"\n\n\"YES! *YES!* Watch me, Elara. Watch how I take him,\" I crow, rocking back and forth, simulating the motions I am too desperate to actually feel. \"Snib... please... I'M BEGGING YOU! RIGHT HERE! POUND ME... OOOOOOH FUCKKK YES, MAKE ME A REAL GOBBO SLUT!\"\n\nSuddenly, Elara lunges forward, cutting off my screams with her mouth. Her kiss is fierce, consuming, as she crashes her lips against mine. I moan into her mouth, vibrations of my vocal cords sending signals of pleasure coursing through both our bodies.\n\nMy hands grip her, pulling her closer, needing her, as the world tilts and spins around me in a dizzying spiral of steam and scent and sensation. Our breasts press together, nipples so hard they're almost *scraping* against each other, and I lose myself in her, in the kiss, in the maddening, rampant need she’s stoked within me.\n\nI'm truly in a frenzy.\n\nThis is the end and the beginning, where I break and am reborn in the steam and the water and the web of our fucked-up desires.[Choice: It's time to get fucked.",

We've been so stressed, and for what? Let all those silly, heroic worries melt away with every stroke of that *wonderful* goblin cock.”\n\nHer fingers trace down my spine, goosebumps erupting in their wake, until they find my ass.\n\nI feel her fingers linger, tracing the quivering line where my flesh meets the hot water.\n\n“Yes, you won't have my respect anymore, my formerly brave knight, but don’t worry about that. *His cock* matters more than anything… more than any boring marital vows.\"\n\nSnib positions himself behind me, his throbbing, grotesque member dribbling drool and *stinking* precum down my lower back. Elara holds my face, keeping it an inch from hers. Her breath smells slightly sour from the goblin seed she's swallowed, reminding me of the hierarchy now placed upon our heads.\n\nElara’s hand, still on my ass, gives a gentle, encouraging squeeze. She grins, her lips curled up in a wicked smile.\n\n\"*Yes*, Elise,\" she purrs, \"Don't fight it. Let him in. I can't wait to watch it... it's gonna be so *good*. I've been imagining how it must feel... He's so big, so much bigger than you ever were. And he's so short, but with that monstrous cock! It's so crazy!\"\n\nI stare into her crazed eyes. “Elara, I—”\n\n“Shh,\" she shushies. \"You're really going to do it. Let one of those monsters you used to kill stick his big, fat bitch-breaking cock into you... you're so wet now.\"\n\nHer words are each a thrilling pang that suffuse my entire being with throbbing.\n\n\"And to see you take it, *hungrily*, *desperately*,\" Elara continues, her grinning mouth now pressed up to mine, \"It gives me such a rush! You won't be Aldric the Great anymore, you'll be Snib's little bitch, of course... but isn't that what you want, Elise?\"\n\nI gasp as Snib's cock nudges against my entrance, the fat, veiny length of him smeared with my arousal, and the roomy, slick cavern of my pussy yearns for him, aches to be filled.\n\n\"YESSS!\" I scream, my voice echoing in the heated air, \"YES, YES, PLEASE! FUCK ME!\"\n\nThe sound that emanates from my throat can only be described as primal, animalistic. The anticipation of that first, exquisite thrust is too much—my pussy clenches emptily, craving the fullness that only Snib can provide.\n\nAs the goblin finally rams his log-like erection into me, I feel a sudden, overwhelming stretch. His veiny shaft plows into my plush, velvety folds, forging a path of hot, searing pleasure that makes me see stars.\n\n\"*Look at you...taking it like a true whore!*\" Elara laughs maniacally. \"*I knew you’d love it. Getting fucked by a real man... something you could never be, my darling Aldric...*\"\n\nHer words are cruel, but they fuel me.\n\nI can feel every inch of Snib's veiny, girthy cock as he pounds into me, his balls slapping against my clit with each thrust. My body responds despite itself, my pussy clenching around him, milking him like it's meant for this.\n\nSnib grunts behind me as my insides polish his cock. \"Yeah, yer just a good meat sleeve, ain't ya?\"\n\nElara giggles, the sound as chilling as it is exciting. “That’s right, Elise,” she coos, her voice filled with a perverse delight. “Snib is a *real* man. Listen to his grunts, his groans… he’s *savoring* you.”\n\nSnib’s thrusts become harsher, each one accompanied by a grunt and the wet smacks of our bodies colliding.\n\nElara's firm grip tightens around my face, forcing me to meet her gaze, her eyes burning with a mix of thrill and revelation. \"I'll admit. I've been resenting you, Elise,\" she confesses breathlessly. “I’ve been holding back. But not anymore. No more secrets. No more lies. I *love* seeing you like this, seeing a *real* cock destroy you.”\n\nHer words cut deep, band unravel something inside me.\n\n\"Isn't it just *proper* to welcome him inside your pussy like a good slut?\" Her tone is mocking, needling. “This is what you were meant for. You’re not a hero. You’re a whore. Now, cum. Cum for him, Elise. Welcome him into your pussy with a *proper* orgasm that makes his cock feel good. Pleasure him with your body. *Be his bitch*.”\n\n“Cum for me, tits-for-brains,” Snib growls, his cock ramming into me relentlessly.\n\nElara’s words, filled with such utter contempt and perverse pleasure, sends a wave of heat rushing through me. My hips buck wildly against Snib’s.\n\nElara’s slaps me, hard, across my face. \"CUM!\" she barks.\n\n“Ughhh… F-fuck! I, uhh…mmnnnggghh,” I babble incoherently.\n\n[Choice: Cum.",

I need to tell you something,” I whisper between gasps, the words choking in my throat. “I—I’m pregnant.”\n\nElara’s eyes widen with joy, her face lighting up with crazed delight. \"Oh, Elise, that’s wonderful!\" Her voice quavers with excitement. “But I want to see it. I want to see him cum inside you and dominate your womb.”\n\nSnib's cock shifts inside me, causing a moan to escape my lips. Elara’s touch is both comforting and distressing as her hands roam over my breasts, holding and squeezing them, amplifying the lewd sounds echoing in the room.\n\n“I want to witness it, Elise. I need to,” Elara whispers urgently, her breath hot against my ear. “I want to see him claim you utterly, fill you completely.”\n\nHer words are twisted, yet under Snib’s potent influence, they stir a humiliating arousal within me. I shudder, not from fear, but because her words scratch an itch buried under layers of my corrupted mind. Snib’s balls swing heavily, their powerful thuds resonating through my body as he fucks me relentlessly.\n\n\"You hear that, titcow?\" Snib sneers. \"Yer wife's all eager to watch me fuck ya and fill ya up.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master!\" I gasp, my voice a breathy, mindless moan.\n\nHis thrusts grow more intense, squishing my flesh and shaking my resolve. The obscene rhythm of skin slapping against skin fills the air, each potent plunge deeper and more commanding.\n\n\"Breed her thoroughly,\" Elara urges, her voice trembling with anticipation. \"Make sure she's absolutely full of your cum.”\n\nSnib leans over me, his hot, rancid breath fanning over my neck, mingling with the steam rising around us. \"Yeahhh, gonna fill you with so much gobbo goo,\" he promises, laughing cruelly. \"Yer body was made for this, wasn’t it? Gonna make sure yer belly’s stuffed full of my pups.\"\n\n\"Mnh- Elara please...\" My protest is weak, and Snib’s snarl cuts me off as he drives himself deeper.\n\n“Don’t worry, sweetheart,” Elara coos, her hands steady and almost protective on my body. \"Just let Snib take over. It's only natural.\"\n\nHer lips press against my ear, whispering dark comfort.\n\n“Just let go, Elise. Give yourself to him completely. He’ll give you all the pleasure… let it happen…”\n\nHer words, mixed with the haze and the rhythmic assault on my pussy, overwhelm me. Snib’s thrusts become a relentless onslaught, my trembling body caught between Elara’s soothing embrace and his brutal claiming.\"Gunna *breed* ya,\" he growls simply. \"Gonna breed you good and proper, now that I broke ya. My reward.\"\n\nThe words strike me like a chilling slap, sobering me through the fog of sexual frenzy. His cock still buried deep, he thrusts with even greater force, each drive deeper, more possessive. The heavy slap of his balls against me echoes around the steamy bathroom.\n\n*Pregnancy.*\n\nHorror seizes me - images of villages ravaged by goblins, their women round with child, their bellies distended — the gobbo pups that emerge from their plundered wombs months later are nightmare fuel.\n\nHis balls aren’t just slapping into me; they're swinging with a heavy thud against me. The drums of my doom.\n\nElara’s arms wrap around me, her body pressing against mine. Her lips hover near my ear, her breath hot and shaky.\n\n\"Sorry, baby, there's nothing I can do,\" she murmurs. Her voice is a bizarre mix of comfort and resignation. \"You're going to get bred by the goblin. It’s his right to breed your pussy, just like you bred me when you were a man.\"\n\nElara's words drip into my ear like poison honey, and I shudder.\n\n*Getting bred... like a beast...*\n\n\"This is about his biological right,\" she continues, her tone almost soothing despite the awful words. \"There's nothing we can do, Elise. This is just the way of things now.\"\n\nElara's hands roam over my heaving breasts, holding them, almost protectively. They jiggle and wobble with each brutal thrust from Snib, the water around us splashing with the force of the goblin's thrusts.\n\nHer smaller breasts press against my own huge, flopping udders. In this moment, we're bound together in a perverse dance of destiny and despair.\n\nSnib leans over my back, his hot, rancid breath fanning over my neck. \"Yeahhh, gonna fill you up with so much gobbo goo,\" he promises, an ugly chuckle accompanying his words. \"Yer pussy was made for breeding, wasn't it? Gonna stuff you full of my pups.\"\n\n\"Ngh- that can’t—\" My protest is cut off by Snib’s guttural snarl as he drives himself deeper.\n\nI moan, not in pleasure, but despair,\n\nBut inexorably, the sound of the moan morphs into a keen squeal as Snib’s thrusts become relentless, pounding into me with the singular purpose of a beast claiming its mate.\n\nElara hugs me tighter, her lips pressed against my ear. \"Just let go, Elise.

      "text": "Snib's monstrous cock presses insistently against my cervix, a sensation I have felt before when Snib bred me for the first time.\n\nBut this time, there’s a new element — Elara’s eyes. Those sapphire orbs lock onto mine, filled with twisted fascination.\n\nHer fingers entwine with mine. \"Elise... let me see it.\"\n\nI can feel Snib’s cockhead nudging against the plush entrance of my womb.\n\n\"Yes,\" she whispers, her voice charged with both fear and undeniable excitement.\n\nWith a guttural grunt, Snib shifts his position, his cockhead pressing more aggressively against my opening cervix. I feel the give, the slow stretch, deep inside. It’s maddening, the sensation of his thick, veiny cock breaching the tight barrier inward into my most sacred place.\n\n“AHN~! OH *GODS*!” my voice rings out in a desperate, escalating wail.\n\nRight there in front of my wife, Snib breaches my innermost sanctum. The sheer force of it feels like an electrifying blast, my eyes rolling back momentarily as my muscles spasm uncontrollably around him.\n\nElara mirrors my moans, her lips parted with the same wonder that engulfs me.\n\nShe’s watching, actually *watching*, as Snib’s grotesque cock pushes into my womb, stretching and filling my maternal chamber.\n\nMy body arches, trembling in the water as every nerve sings with the impossible sensation of being penetrated so deeply, so profoundly. I feel utterly, devastatingly claimed.\n\n“Unnnngghhh~! *Elara*!” I cry, nausea and ecstasy blending.\n\nMy wife’s fingers tighten around mine, her breath hot against my cheek.\n\nIn that moment, we transcend the twisted horror of the scene, our eyes locked in a connection so powerful, it siphons fear and turns naked, primal pleasure into something more profound.\n\nOur fingers clench tighter, grounding me as white-hot pleasure crashes over me like a violent storm. My womb contractions feel like a writhing beast within me, milking Snib’s cockhead for all it’s worth.\n\n“YES! FUCKING YES! BREACH ME!” I scream.\n\nMy body spasms uncontrollably, small tremors shaking from the very center of my being as Snib slams himself into my willing, welcoming depths.\n\n\"*Elaraaa!!!*\" The scream is animalistic, guttural.\n\nHer free hand caresses my heaving breast, her thumb grazing my rock-hard nipple. ]Suddenly, I feel a slick, warm sensation against my cervix. I whimper, my mind flashing back to a horrific sight from the Griznak Gobboree, where Snib took his prize in the form of a slave girl.\n\nMy body is trembling, my breath ragged, and a cold fear lances through me as reality hits. Snib is about to claim me, just like he claimed her... all the way, so far inside it'll...\n\n\"*Ungh... oh god... Elara...*\" I manage to gasp out between whimpers. \"H-He's... I feel him... he's gonna... gonna...\"\n\n\"D-do what, Elise?\" Elara's voice actually sounds concerned. \"What is it? Talk to me.\"\n\n\"He's... he's gonna... fuck my womb,\" I whisper, the words causing a shiver to run down my spine. \"I... I saw him do it... at the Gobboree... to a slave girl...\"\n\nThere's a moment of silence.\n\n\"*He's... what?*\"\n\nBut even as I try to explain, I can feel it happening.\n\nMy cervix, the muscular ring at the base of my uterus normally keeps its tight seal, but now, Snib's gooey pre-cum is seeping into it, its specialized toxic chemicals slowly dilating it.\n\nI feel Snib's huge cock-head nudging against my softening cervix, each contact sending shivers of fear down my spine.\n\n\"Shhh... It's okay, Elise... Snib is just doing what's... natural for him,” Elara says, pressing her finger to my lips, her voice soothing, but strained.\n\nBut there's nothing *natural* about this.\n\nIt's perverse. It feels awful.\n\nThere’s a distinct shift in sensation, a distinct ‘pop’ I can feel deep in my core. An alien, horrifying emptiness fills me as my womb opens to accommodate Snib's monstrous goblin cock.\n\nA gut-wrenching scream explodes from my lips as Snib enters my inner womanhood. My whole body quakes, spasms wracking my petite form, my big breasts jiggling, bouncing wildly.\n\n\"OH FUCKING EPHEMERALS! MY WOMB! YOU'RE IN MY FUCKING WOMB!\" I shriek, my hands clutching desperately at Elara.\n\nSnib grunts in pleasure, his gnarly hand smacking my ass, causing me to gulp down a ragged breath.\n\n\"*FUCK!*\" I sob, tears streaking down my face.\n\nThe rhythm of my womb walls contracting around him drives him deeper. The fat, mushroom-shaped head of his cock pushes the fleshy walls of my uterus apart, burrowing deeper into my feminine core.\n\nHis pre-cum drools out in thick ropes, the viscous substance lubricating his advance into my deepest internals.\n\nMy uterus contracts, the muscles clenching and unclenching as if trying to rid the organ of the intrusion. But each contraction only serves to milk Snib’s cock, causing him to respond with gratuitous thrusts.\n\n\"P-please... please, Snib!\" I beg, my voice a ragged whimper. \"Not so deep... I... I can't handle...\"\n\nBut the plea dies on my lips as he adjusts his angle, his cockhead colliding with the top of my womb. The sensation is blinding, a mix of horrifying pain and perverse pleasure that sends me spiraling into a state of absolute frenzy.\n\nMy whimpered protests dissolve into incoherent, breathless cries. My mind fills with the horrifying reality that my womb, the center of my new femininity, was being ruthlessly pounded by a goblin's fat, veiny cock.\n\nSnib's cock throbs with each powerful throb of my pulse, his monstrous member stretching my womb to its limits.\n\nThe feeling is indescribable, a mind-numbing, soul-destroying violation that robs me of all coherent thought. I'm left whimpering incoherently, my body shuddering, my huge breasts splashing and wobbling in the water as Elara holds me.\n\nMy womb, my sacred, innermost sanctuary, is now stuffed full of fat gobbo cockhead.\n\n\"Fuckin’ *tight* in here, gonna stretch ya good, breed ya deep!\" Snib grunts from behind me, his hands gripping my hips with bruising force.[Choice: He goes faster.",

He spanks me hard, the sound echoing in the steamy bathroom. \"You've gone from Goblin Butcher to Goblin Breeder. Gonna fill ya with gobbo pups!”\n\nElara whispers, “He’s going to fill your womb, baby. Just so I can watch.”\n\nHis cock swells inside me, throbbing heavily.\n\nElara presses her body against mine. \"I want to see him cum inside you.\"\n\nHe spanks me hard, and my orgasm crashes over me, my pussy clenching around his cock.\n\n\"*Fuck! I-I'm CUMMING!*\" I scream.\n\nSnib grunts, preparing to unload inside me. \"Ready, hero? Here comes yer fuckin' legacy!\"\n\nBuried deep, he gives a guttural grunt and—\n\nBLURRRRT!\n\nThe force of his ejaculation is staggering, slamming into my womb in a hot, thick torrent. Each spurt is potent, claiming me utterly.\n\n\"YEAH! PISSING CUM INTO YA!\" he screams, triumph dripping from his tone. \"I'm nuttin' right in yer womb, cow-tits!\"\n\nHis body shudders violently as he continues to ejaculate, each *SPLURT!* filling me further. His nasty sperm floods my womb, the hot, slimy seed clinging to every inch, saturating my insides.\n\nI scream, my brain fogged with the mix of pain and perverse pleasure. Each hot jet of Snib’s cum fills me to the brim, branding me as his.\n\nI squirt helplessly around Snib’s cock, my body convulsing repeatedly. Elara moans, her own body reacting to the potent pheromones filling the room, arching and trembling beside me.\n\nIn that shared, perverse ecstasy, I am fully and potently Snib’s breeding bitch, my womb thoroughly claimed.\n\n\"See that, Elara?” Snib murmurs, almost tenderly, as he looks down at me. “She’s all mine now, my bimbo breeding cow.”\n\nElara nods, her eyes glazed with a mix of affection and dark satisfaction. \"Yes...\"\"Get ready, bitch,\" Snib growls, his hot breath puffing against my exposed neck. \"Been waitin' fer this fer a while.\"\n\nHis words send a chill down my spine, but a sick thrill of pleasure with it.\n\n\"You hear that, you slut? That's the sound of your destiny changing,\" Snib growls, his voice thick with gleeful malice. He spanks me hard, his hand landing with a loud smack that reverberates through my quivering body. \"You were the Goblin Butcher, huh? Well, now you're gonna be the Goblin Breeder. Gonna fill ya with gobbo pups, maybe twins, or *fuckin' triplets*!\"\n\nHis laughter rings in my ears over the relentless, wet slap of goblin-on-human rutting. It’s a sound that heralds my fall from hero to breeding stock.\n\nElara whispers, her voice trembling with a mix of horror and arousal, \"He's going to fill your womb up, baby. Directly where it counts.\"\n\nThe thought sends a shiver of terror down my spine. But there’s no stopping it now. Snib's cock swells, throbbing heavily.\n\nHe spanks me hard, and my orgasm comes in a shuddering rush. \"Shit! *Shit*! I-It's...\" I scream, loud and breathless, my pussy clenching around Snib's cock, a wave of pleasure burning through me from where his cock is buried to the tips of my toes. I spasm, body convulsing as I gush a stream of squirting juices down my thighs, splashing the already soaking wet bathroom floor. \"I'M CUMMING!\"\n\nSuddenly, I feel Snib’s cock twitch and throb, buried deep within me. His balls tighten against me, the sack drawing upwards as he prepares to unload.\n\n\"You ready, hero? Here comes your fuckin' legacy, you dumb whore!\"\n\nBuried fully inside me, he gives a guttural grunt and-\n\nBLURRRRT!\n\nThe force of the ejaculation is so powerful, so viscerally potent, that my mind whites out from the sheer intensity. Hot, thick, putrid streams of goblin seed flood my womb, each spurt heavier, thicker...\n\n\"UNNNNGH! YEAHHH! FUCKING PISSING CUM INTO YOU!\" he screams out, triumph in his tone, relishing the total supremacy of breeding his foe. Snib lets out a squeal of delight, his hateful goblin voice filled with a perverse joy. \"I'm nuttin' right in yer womb, cow-tits! Oh FUCK!\"\n\nHis body shudders violently as he continues to eject jet after staggering jet into me. His eyes are wild, ecstatic with the power of his climax.\n\nEach *SPLURRRRT!* is a hot, heavy expulsion that paints my inner walls with his vile essence. His goblin seed is like molten fire, a burning torrent that floods my womb, invading me at the most primal level.\n\nThis isn't just a fuck. This is a claiming. Each spurt feels like it's carving him into my flesh, rewriting my purpose from warrior to broodmare.\n\nSnib's nasty, potent sperm intertwines with the delicate fabric of my eggs, altering, overpowering, dominating them.\n\nHis filthy, putrid cum floods directly into my womb, the walls contracting around the thick spunk. The hot, slimy seed clings to every inch of internal surface, saturating the fleshy folds. The potent, gooey goblin sperm soaks into my womb's lining, preparing to invade the precious space, seeking vulnerable human eggs to bond with.\n\nYet - each squirt, each *blurrp* of life-ruining, egg-fertilizing cum is a mind-numbingly powerful orgasmic wave of pleasure that tears through me.\n\nI scream and babble incoherently, my eyes rolling back in ecstasy. Splish-splashing waves of girly cunt-squirt are forced out around Snib's cock with each convulsion of my own brainless orgasms.\n\nMy cries continue, part agony, part ecstasy as each heavy, gooey jet of Snib’s cum fills me to the brim. It's like he's excreting his vile essence directly into the core of my being, a hot, nasty dump of breeding sludge that brands me as his property.\n\nElara gasps beside me, her body convulsing. The potent, mind-altering pheromones in the air from Snib's overwhelming orgasm triggers an orgasm in her, too. She jerks and moans, her hand cupping one of her breasts as she arches her back, lost in the perverse pleasure of a goblin's domination.\n\nI am being bred.\n\nI, Aldric the Great, am being inseminated and fertilized by a three feet tall goblin. But there's no denying it... The biological domination, the claiming, it's all so real... and there's no way to fight it. I whimper, the reality sinking in. I am Snib's breeding bitch.\n\nElara’s hold on me is both a comfort and a chain, her presence a reminder of our shared fall, our mutual madness.[Choice: He pulls out.",

The abrupt emptiness inside me is almost as shocking as the brutal stuffing had been.\n\nElara leans over, her eyes wide with a morbid curiosity as she watches.\n\n\"Oh wow,\" she coos.\n\nThe sensation is visceral—my cervix spasms as it clutches at the retreating goblin cock, trying futilely to hold onto the invader that had filled it so completely. As Snib pulls out completely, it snaps back closed, a sudden tightness that seals an enormous load of thick, hot, stinking goblin cum inside its fertile chamber.\n\nThe thick, ropey strands of goblin cum ooze sluggishly from my well-used pussy, dribbling down my thighs in a filthy, yellow-tinged cascade that taints the bathwater.\n\nElara giggles, \"Look how much he filled you up!\"\n\nThe sperm inside me isn’t just semen; it's a potent genetic missile programmed for conquest. Snib's vile seed has one purpose—to rewrite the DNA of my eggs, ensuring that any offspring I might bear would carry his goblin heritage, pure and unchallenged. This isn't just impregnation; it's genetic domination—a forcible claim laid by a creature viewed traditionally as nothing more than a savage beast.\n\nThe dribble of cum leaking out of me picks up pace as my abused pussy attempts to expel the excess. Each drop that hits the water sends tiny ripples dancing across the surface, turning the bath into a cloudy soup.\n\n*BLURRP... SPLAT...*\n\nMore of the cum finds its way out. Alone on my hands and knees, I listen to the soft, repugnant sounds of Snib's seed spilling from me, each *plop* and *splash* echoing in the dimly lit bathroom.\n\n\"You bred her well,\" she tells him gently.\n\nSnib chuckles. \"Yeah, that'll teach the mighty Skulgaroth.

Show some gratitude.\"\n\nSnib chuckles, a low, guttural sound. \"Yeah, show me how thankful you sluts are.\"\n\nThe goblin exudes a sense of complete ownership. He rests one of his gnarled hands on the back of Elara's head, gently pushing her mouth closer to his dick. The other hand finds the back of my head, drawing me in with a rougher insistence.\n\nI'm dizzy, the room spinning slightly as I move closer. The heavy scent of sex and goblin musk fills my nostrils, intoxicating and overwhelming. My lips part hesitantly, and as they touch the dripping tip of Snib's cock, a shiver runs through my body.\n\n\"Kiss it together, bitches. You're both mine now,\" Snib growls, his voice gruff and owning.\n\nElara looks into my eyes, her lips still brushing against the throbbing head of Snib’s cock. There's a wildness in her gaze, a carnal need that both frightens and arouses me. Slowly, her lips meet mine, enveloping the bulbous head of Snib’s cock between us.\n\nOur lips press together, sliding over the slippery, pre-cum coated tip, our tongues occasionally brushing against each other and the hot, pulsing flesh between them. We kiss deeply, passionately, lost in the depraved act of sharing our goblin master's cock.\n\nOur tongues dance together, swirling around the head of his cock, the trickle of residual goblin cum acting as a perverse bonding agent between us.\n\n\"Good girls, fuckin’ whores,\" Snib groans, his fingers tightening in our hair, guiding the rhythm of our shared worship.\n\nThe taste of him — bitter and musky — mixes with the familiar, softer taste of Elara’s mouth. Snib’s cock pulses, dribbling more of his heavy, pheromone-packed cum. It fills our mouths, the potent liquid mingling with our saliva as we kiss and suck around him.\n\nDriven by his words and the relentless churn of the pheromones clouding my mind, I fall deeper into the haze. Our kissing becomes fervent, desperate. We're not just kissing each other now; we're worshiping him, adoring the very cock that has claimed and degraded us.\n\nFinally, with a satisfied grunt, Snib pulls away, leaving a string of saliva and cum bridging our lips. \"Enough,\" he commands. \"To yer bedroom.

She brings her slick fingers up to her lips.\n\n\"Let's get you to bed, darling. You're in no shape to stand. Besides, Snib’s not finished yet,\" she singsongs.\n\nShe's quick to turn her attention back to our goblin overlord, delicately patting down his damp green skin, paying special attention to drying off his still semi-erect cock and hefty balls.\n\nThen, Elara guides me - her hand is warm in mine, a comforting presence amidst the debasing situation. She brings me towards the bed — our bed. The place where we've made love, where we've shared dreams and secrets.

His massive, veiny cock lines up with her entrance.\n\n\"Sorry, ladies, can’t let ya have all the fun without me,\" he smirks.\n\nBefore either of us can react, he thrusts forward.

Her moans, loud and unabashed, mingle with his grunts, creating a debauched symphony of lust and dominance.\n\nAs she writhes on top of me, her sapphire eyes now glazed with a mixture of pain and pleasure, something within me shudders. This isn't just physical. It's a psychological unmaking and remaking at the hands of our goblin master.\n\nElara’s voice, when it finally emerges through her moans, is shaky but filled with a dark, twisted joy. \"Oh gods, Elise... he's fucking me... and... and it's incredible. I... I'm glad we... could share this...\"\n\nThrough the haze, I realize — in some demented, broken way — this is closeness. This shared submission under Snib’s harsh rule is a bond, a sinister thread tying us together in the dark.

This is all my fault.\n\nWith each of his brutal thrusts into her, Elara’s body lurches forward, hammering her abdomen against mine. I feel the undulating bulge of his cock through her belly, against my own sperm-filled womb.\n\nThe room's air is thick and heavy with lust. It’s intoxicating — the overpowering smell of Snib's musk mingled with the bleachy stench of the cum inside me. Elara’s moans are both pitiful and erotic, a mix of pain, pleasure, and complete submission. It’s heartbreaking, hearing those sounds come from the lips I've kissed a thousand times before.

Elara's lips press against mine, desperate and needy. I can feel her breath against my face, short and ragged. There's a distant rumble, a sound that's both low and deep — Snib's growl of impending climax. Even though it feels far away, I recognize the forewarning, having just experienced it myself.\n\nSnib's enormous balls tighten, pressing up against Elara's ass. I can feel the pressure through her, the way she tenses up. Her eyes, so clouded moments before, suddenly have a sharp, terrible clarity, and I understand. She's realizing what's about to happen to her too, the full implications of the goblin's seed.\n\nElara's moans shift in tone, mixing fear with pleasure. Her voice reaches a higher pitch, a sound that resonates deep within me. She breaks our kiss, her head thrown back, exposing the long column of her slender throat. She's so lost, so vulnerable in that moment, and it’s heart-wrenching.\n\nShe's pregnant with our baby.\n\nAs Snib thrusts harder, faster, I picture the virulent flood about to be unleashed within Elara. I remember the tales — of goblin seed's potent, vile nature, the way it erases any trace of another's offspring, replacing it with its own. The vision in my mind is disturbingly clear: a swarm of aggressive goblin sperm racing toward her womb, where the tiny life Aldric and Elara created is just beginning to grow.\n\nI visualize those millions of predatory cells, honing in on the fragile fetus. They don’t attack it directly but instead, as if by some cruel, deliberate design, sever its connection to Elara, to its lifeline. It's a grotesque dance of nature — of one species asserting dominance over another at the most fundamental level. The tendrils of Elara's womb that once nourished our child would be replaced, rerouted to nourish the monstrous spawn of Snib. [Choice: He fills her up.",

      "text": "“*Here it fucking comes!*” Snib howls, as his body stiffens. The ominous pulse of his cock heralds what is about to occur.\n\nI can almost hear the sinister hiss of his seed as it fills her.\n\nElara's beautiful body jerks and squirms beneath Snib's, her cries growing weaker as her body is pumped full of goblin cum. She gasps, her eyes finding mine as she receives her deep sperm injection.\n\n“*Yeah! Take it! All of it!*” His voice is gleeful, depraved. “Make room for daddy, bitch!”\n\nThe bed creaks under the force of his fervor, each thrust a hammer driving the final nails into the coffin of our future. Elara’s grip on me slackens, her body succumbing to the overwhelming sensation of being claimed by this beast.\n\nMy heart pounds. The horror of it grips me like a vise—his semen, potent and lethal, is likely waging a microscopic war inside my wife. Our baby—our hope for the future—is being erased, cell by cell, replaced by the monstrous progeny of a beast.\n\nAs Snib finally pulls out, a thick, gooey strand of cum linking his dripping cock to Elara’s ravaged pussy, the silence that falls is deafening.\n\nIt's a moment of abject terror and profound emptiness. The bed beneath us, once a sanctuary for our love, now feels like an altar of sacrifice where our future dies, smothered under the stinking, bleachy flood of goblin cum.\n\nElara locks eyes with me, wide-eyed and trembling, yet there’s a frantic kind of satisfaction flickering in her gaze. Glops of Snib’s jizz trickle from her well-used pussy, running down the length of my thigh, thick and warm.\n\nShe’s breathless and manic as her hands roam over my body, cupping the hefty swell of my breasts, thumbing my tender nipples. Her touch sends shivers through me.\n\nI'm disgustingly aroused. Snib has tainted us both so thoroughly.\n\nWe’re panting, lost in a haze of pheromone-induced lust.\n\n\"Isn’t it beautiful, Elise?\" my wife muses, a twisted smile curling her lips as she presses them against mine. \"We’re his now… fully his.\"\n\nOur kisses are sloppy, desperate, our moans mingling with the obscene squelches of cum that continue to seep from out pussies. Our bodies squirm together, moving rhythmically in a grotesque parody of the love we used to share.\n\n“Y-yes, it’s... it’s perfect,” I mumble against her lips, brain fogged by the stench of goblin seed. My body reacts on its own, pressing into her touch, craving more of her, more of this perverse connection we’ve fallen into.\n\n\"We've been bred together,\" Elara whispers. \"Just like he wanted.\"\n\n“Yes,\" I agree distantly, my voice almost dreamy as I wrap my arms around her, pulling her closer into the filth and warmth of our shared degradation. \"Together… we'll never be lonely…\"\n\nThe room spins around us into a nightmarish carousel as Snib takes full advantage of our compliance. He uses our bodies continuously, mindlessly, ensuring every crevice and cavity is filled and re-filled with his virulent load, marking us inside and out as his property.\n\nHours later, the room reeks. Every familiar smell of our home has been overwhelmed by the stench of goblin seed.\n\nThe bed sheets are drenched, stained with puddles and streams of off-white, putrid cum that leak from Elara and myself. Every inch of us is sticky, every crevice filled and coated.\n\nSnib, still brimming with that disgusting goblin stamina, leans over, allowing his semi-erect cock to drape heavily across Elara’s delicate face. She whimpers, her lips trembling as they're brought close to the base of his shaft. He grunts, a command more than a request, and she starts lapping at his oversized ballsack with a resigned obedience, her tongue sliding over the wrinkled, sweaty skin.\n\nLost in this dusk of defilement, Elara and I are mere shadows of the people we once were, surrendered wholly not just to Snib, but to the beastly nature of our own darkest desires.\n\nEven as my conscious mind screams in distant protest, my body, subjugated and spent, sinks deeper into the mattress, drowning in the foul bliss of our ruin.\n\nI reach out, and our hands find each other amidst the mess. Elara's fingers interlock with mine, and for a fleeting moment, there's a sense of solidarity, a mutual understanding of our shared plight.\n\nThough the physical act has ended, its repercussions have just begun. A new era of subservience dawns - I know it deep in my bones.\n\nSoon, our bodies will swell with the next generation of goblin spawn. A testament to Snib’s victory over Aldric, the hero, and his beautiful wife. His pheromones will biologically ensure that our bodies will be ever ready, ever compliant.\n\nMy vision is hazy, the world tilting and spinning, the combined effect of the pheromones and the cum-drunk euphoria.\n\nWe're ruined, both of us.\n\nThere’s no going back from this.\n\nWe’ve been thoroughly fucked in every sense of the word, our identities and past lives obliterated.\n\nAs the weight of the situation presses down on me, the room seems to grow dimmer. I hold onto Elara’s hand tighter, the last thread of my former life. A wave of fatigue hits me, and my eyelids feel impossibly heavy. As the world fades away, my last conscious thought is of Elara and the future we now face as mothers to goblin spawn. The next chapter of our lives awaits, a chapter filled with darkness, submission, and the constant reminder of our utter defeat.[Choice: Two weeks later...",

Elara, her auburn hair tied back in a messy bun, stands beside me, kneading dough. I can't help but glance at her body, her slender form seeming even more exaggerated with the swell of the rapid, goblin-induced pregnancy. A strange pang of envy strikes me as I compare our changing bodies, her belly seeming to hold its shape better than mine.\n\n“They're so tender,\" Elara mutters, looking down at her breasts. There's a flush on her cheeks, probably from the oven's warmth but also the arousal that courses through both of us constantly.\n\nSnib’s pheromones cling to the air, ensuring our absolute submission, ensuring we’ll make the perfect mothers.\n\n“My nipples are getting darker too,” I glance down, seeing how they've deepened in hue.\n\nWith a sigh, Elara reaches out and gently rubs my belly. “They’re growing so fast.” Our fingers entwine, the last semblance of our bond. But it’s more like the bond between ‘sister wives’ than any sort of marriage.\n\nSnib's voice, gruff and commanding, interrupts our moment.\n\n\"Oi, Tit-bitch! Hurry up with that bread. Master's hungry,\" he sneers, standing at the entrance of the kitchen. His bulbous, half-hard cock dangles visibly, a constant reminder of the potency and virility that binds us to him. The smell of him makes my knees weak.\n\nI nod submissively, \"Yes, Master.\" And with a little more urgency, I continue helping Elara, kneading the dough and setting another loaf to bake.\n\nWhen I arrive with the loaf, Snib's grubby hand suddenly closes around my massive breast, squeezing it forcefully. \"Oi, let's see if these udders got any milk in 'em yet,\" he growls, his fingers digging deep into my swollen flesh.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nA rush of sensation tingles from my chest to my very core as I gasp, my nipples painfully hardening under his rough touch. They've become increasingly sensitive, betraying my body's preparations for motherhood.\n\nA strangled moan escapes my lips as he rolls the nipple between his fingers, pulling and twisting it as if testing its functionality. There's an intense pressure building inside, a need for release. But I can feel that it's too soon, that my body is still adjusting to its new role.\n\nI can barely believe it when I feel a tiny trickle of warm wetness drip onto my exposed skin. A mixture of humiliation and shock runs through me. I hadn’t expected this so soon. I can feel the beginnings of the sweet, rich liquid, my body's way of preparing to nourish another life. The sensation is overwhelming; a mixture of discomfort, arousal, and a curious warmth that spreads from the point of Snib's touch to my very core.\n\n\"Heh, just a wee bit,\" Snib chuckles, flicking the dampened tip. \"Soon, ye'll really have the cow tits ye was always meant to have.\" His words echo in my ears, reinforcing what I've become, a vessel, a source of sustenance.\n\nI can't form words, my mind blank, only a deep moan of arousal escapes my lips, my body betraying me, the pheromones drowning out any other sensation. The remnants of the mighty hero Aldric, buried deep within, are silenced by the sheer weight of my latest transformation.[Choice: Another week goes by...",

Snib's chuckles, gruff and lewd, cut through the hum of my daze as he prods my wide hips forward. Next to me, Elara's delicate hand reaches out, fingertips brushing against mine, as if in search of the comfort and familiarity we once shared. But that hand now feels so different, so strange.\n\n\"Lookit the once mighty hero!\" Snib cackles, gripping my arm with a greasy hand, emphasizing every syllable with a rough squeeze. I can't fully grasp the extent of what he's talking about, but an undercurrent of discomfort prickles my senses. His musky scent, overpoweringly male, permeates the air, making my body flood with warmth. \"And his luscious wife, all swollen with my seed!\"\n\nThe townsfolk of Eboncrest surround us, their eyes fixed upon Elara and me. Whispers and murmurs create a dissonant symphony of judgment and morbid curiosity. Pointed fingers and hushed voices tell me they're talking about us, about our visible pregnancies. The weight of their gazes, some pitying, some condemning, presses down on me, making it harder to move.\n\nSuddenly, a booming voice cuts through the hum of my haze.\n\n\"Snib!\" Mayor Bramble's strong, forceful tone shakes me momentarily from my stupor. I vaguely recognize his face, concern and anger evident in his eyes. \"You bring them inside this instant!\"\n\nThe goblin sneers, his massive bulge twitching visibly beneath his loincloth.\n\n\"Wizard gave me permission. More I do to 'em, the better!\"\n\nBefore Mayor Bramble can retort, a tall figure in an indigo robe appears. His cold eyes survey the scene, and with an elegance that belies his intentions, he approaches the mayor.\n\n\"It's quite alright, Mayor Bramble,\" Zephyrion says, his voice smooth as velvet. \"Let's discuss this privately.\"\n\nI watch, through a clouded veil of pheromones and confusion, as the wizard takes the mayor aside, his words too quiet for me to discern. I feel a tug on my arm, Snib urging us onward, but his steps are slower, more deliberate.\n\n\"Take 'em home, goblin. Don't draw more attention than you already have,\" Zephyrion commands, not even sparing us a glance.\n\nI don't fully comprehend the gravity of his words, but something within me mourns the loss of the life I once knew, replaced now with the weight of my belly and the thick fog that clouds my mind.[Choice: Another week goes by...",

The sensation of the milk inside them feels like there's a constant warmth inside, waiting to escape, tingling at the slightest touch or movement.\n\nThe muffled moans from upstairs do little to distract me. I know Elara's with Snib. The rough, animalistic rhythm of their lovemaking wafts above the otherwise silent home ambiance.\n\nI can't help but feel a pang of jealousy; why her and not me? Yet, at the same time, a part of me is glad for the respite. There's too much going on inside my head. And I'm still a little sore from last time...\n\nSuddenly, the kitchen door creaks open. Startled, I instinctively pull the skirt higher to cover my chest, realizing too late the futility of the action. The familiar sight of Master Fendril steps through, his eyes wide behind his spectacles. He tries not to stare at my exposed chest, but it's evident he's struggling.\n\nClearing his throat, he whispers, \"Elise, it's me, Fendril.\"\n\n\"I see you, Master Fendril,\" I say, voice dripping with the haze of pheromones. \"Do you like my new look?\"\n\n\"By the gods… this is what’s become of you…” He tries to keep his voice steady but the tremble betrays his emotion. \"I heard rumors, but this... Zephyrion has truly gone too far. This is *madness*. This is cruel beyond cruel.”\n\nWhile his words should strike a chord, make me feel something, anything – they don't. The fog is too thick. My mind feels blank, my thoughts slow and sludgy, like trying to wade through knee-deep mud.\n\n\"We have to be quiet,\" he continues, his voice dropping even lower. \"Snib can't know I'm here.\"\n\n\"Snib is with Elara,\" I say, placidly. We can both can hear her upstairs, moaning, whimpering. \"They'll be another few hours.\"\n\nFendril hastily reaches into his robes, producing a small vial filled with a shimmering aqua liquid. \"This is Moonshade. You *can't drink it yet*. It would be toxic during your pregnancy. But once you've given birth, Elise, you *must* take it immediately.\"\n\nConfusion clouds my mind further. \"Why?\" I manage to ask.\n\n\"To start reclaiming your mind,\" he says, his tone urgent. \"Zephyrion has played his cards. You and Elara are just pawns in his game. But with this, you can begin to push back. I hope the damage is not permanent. I believe you can recover.\"\n\n\"But I feel fine,\" I murmur, though the words sound distant, even to my ears. Everything feels like it's underwater.\n\nFendril's face contorts in frustration, his fingers twitching. \"Listen to me, Elise. You're drowning in that fog. You have to fight it. For now, keep the potion safe. And when the time is right, you drink it. Promise me.\"\n\nSomewhere, deep down, perhaps a small part of Aldric resonates with Fendril's plea.\n[Choice: Promise him.",

Something I can't explain.\n\nFendril's gaze shifts from me to the room's interior, and the weight of regret presses on his shoulders, evident in the slump of his posture.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Elise,\" he says, anguish evident in his voice. \"Sorry that I ever involved Zephyrion. I never anticipated he'd descend to such depths of madness. He used to be a scholar. A mentor. But alas, curiosity has mutated and warped into power-lust.”\n\nMy thoughts are cloudy, struggling to grasp onto the tendrils of understanding. But I feel the need to do something hospitable, this poor guest seems haggard.\n\nWith shaky hands, I take a glass, feeling the weight of his slack-jawed stare on me. I lift my already engorged breast, the skin stretched taut and hot to the touch. The pressure inside is evident as, with careful squeezing, milk streams forth. It pulses out in rhythmic squirts, each droplet capturing the room's light, reflecting the amber glow of the fireplace. I can feel the relief as the pressure subsides, even as the intensity of the sensation sends another rush of hormones flooding through me.\n\n\"Master Fendril,\" I say, offering the glass, my voice dreamy and distant, \"Would you care for a drink? You must be thirsty after coming all this way.”\n\nThe wizard's eyes widen in horror. \"No, Elise... I... it's alright.\" There's a pause, his throat bobbing as he swallows hard.\n\nWith a shrug, I place the glass of milk on the table. Snib would enjoy it later, I think vaguely, although he usually prefers it direct from the source.\n\nThe wizard takes a deep breath, the strain evident on his face. \"I know you may not remember this. But I feel compelled to tell you anyway. Zephyrion has begun excavating the ruins beneath Ironrock Mine. Rumors suggest he’s found the sanctum of Maraan. If true, his power will be unmatched.\"\n\nTo me, it’s like he's speaking in riddles. Everything seems distant, intangible, as if I'm trying to capture smoke with my hands.\n\n\"He wields too much influence in the king’s court,” Fendril continues, pacing the room with growing urgency. \"None of the other wizards dare to oppose him. I feel so isolated. I have no hope of challenging him.”\n\n\"That's ok, I'm sure you're doing your best,\" I say vapidly. Brainlessly. The room grows tense, Fendril's anguish palpable, like a physical entity. The very walls seem to absorb his despair.\n\nHe looks around, then back at me. \"Remember, the Moonshade. It's *important*,\" he urges. But there's no promise of a return, no plan, just resignation.\n\nWithout another word, Master Fendril turns, leaving me alone in the dim kitchen. The only sound is the soft crackle of the fireplace and my own ragged breathing.\n\nThe vial shimmers in my hands. Even in my hazy state, something tells me to keep it safe.

My engorged breasts weigh down heavily on my chest, filled to the brim, ready to nurture the goblin whelps that churn within my equally engorged belly.\n\nThe warmth between my legs is incessant, as if every part of me is primed and on fire, yearning for some kind of release.\n\nThe weight of being so heavily pregnant is agonizing. Just standing up or moving around is painful. I can barely make it up or down the stairs.\n\nThe sensation of *three* goblin babies squirming inside me is bizarre - their little fists and feet prodding my insides with none of the langour or softness of human babies - it's like they're trying to claw their way out!\n\nFrom the corner of my groggy vision, Elara looks just as dazed, her belly protruding, albeit not quite as prominently as mine. I catch a brief glance of her azure eyes, hazy with the pheromones, before a veil of lustful stupor clouds them again.\n\nZephyrion's attendants, donned in indigo robes, work around us with a focused efficiency, transforming our once cozy abode into a birthing chamber. They lay down thick blankets, place various bowls filled with steaming water, herbs, and an assortment of instruments on a side table.\n\nCandles light the space, casting an ethereal glow that only serves to further distance me from reality.\n\nZephyrion himself, towering in his slender elegance, watches everything with a keen eye, occasionally scribbling something on parchment. His sharp, stormy grey eyes land on me for a split second, and I feel like a specimen under examination.\n\n\"Make sure everything is in order. The birth of these goblin children will catalyze the power we need.\" His voice is filled with cold authority.\n\nA group of Eboncrest’s midwives shuffle in hesitantly, their expressions a mixture of fear and curiosity.They know me. Know who I was. Yet now, they see me in this debased state, ready to birth goblin offspring, and it’s evident they struggle with their own emotions. They begin by gently checking over Elara and me, their fingers probing, eyes assessing. The touch of a familiar hand against my swollen belly momentarily grounds me.\n\nSnib stands away from the proceedings. He leers, his voice dripping with pride, \"Oi, tit-bitch! 'bout time these brats came outta ya!\"\n\nHe chuckles darkly, but even in his typical crude demeanor, I detect a hint of unease as he keeps glancing warily at Zephyrion. The two have always had a strange relationship.\n\nElara’s whimpers break my concentration. She’s feeling it. The contractions. The impending moment of release and life. Our shared foggy reality is broken by spikes of sharp pain.\n\nOne of the midwives, a stern older woman named Marda, directs the others in a calm but firm voice.\n\n\"Prepare the warm cloths and the birthing herbs. And keep the lavender oil close—it might help soothe them.\"\n\nSnib wrinkles his nose at that.\n\n\"Master doesn't like lavender,\" I gasp.\n\nThe midwife ignores me. They don't seem to care much about what Snib wants.\n\nElara groans beside me, her fingers digging into the makeshift quilt beneath us. We're both dealing with the contractions and the sharp, clawing movements. At one point, a protrusion, looking distinctly like a small, four-fingered hand, presses against her belly, distorting the skin into an eerie outline that quickly withdraws.\n\n\"*See! They're eager to come out!*\" Snib laughs, clearly amused by our ordeal.\n\nPillows prop us up at an angle, while pots of steaming water emit a ghostly vapor into the air.\n\nAs another contraction clenches my insides viciously, I can’t help but let out a low, gut-wrenching moan. My hand flies to my belly, feeling the surreal and terrifying movements within. At one moment, it feels as if multiple small limbs are pushing outward, testing the limits of my skin before retreating.\n\nThe midwives move with haste, dabbing my forehead with cool cloths soaked in lavender and chamomile.\n\n“Steady, lass,” murmurs one of the midwives, positioning herself between my legs. “Deep breaths, now.”\n\nZephyrion, approaches, holding a glowing crystal rod. He glances between Elara and me, his gaze clinical, detached. “Prepare,” he instructs coldly. “It’s time.”\n\nThe pain intensifies, a cruel crescendo that rips a scream from my throat—a sound so raw and primal that it's barely human. My body contorts involuntarily, muscles contracting violently as nature and nightmare collide in the act of childbirth.\n\nElara, too, begins to scream, her own pains echoing mine, our cries intertwining in the thick, oppressive air of the chamber.\n\nMy body, my once-heroic form, is reduced to a fleshy incubator, preparing to bring Snib’s spawn into the world. Elara, beside me, is in no better state. Her moans sound so distant, so detached, as if echoing from another world.\n\nZephyrion, that clinical, detached bastard, begins speaking, his tone firm yet without a hint of excitement. “This isn’t your typical human birth, and it will be nothing like what you have experienced before. The goblin seed has transformed these women’s bodies, making them the perfect vessels for goblin pups. Within them, their babies are pure goblins.”\n\nOne of the midwives, a younger woman with a sprinkling of freckles across her cheeks, raises her hand slightly. \"What... what effects should we expect, sir?\"\n\n\"The human body has a miraculous adaptability,\" Zephyrion begins, his voice devoid of wonder. \"The two will likely birth simultaneously due to the synchronized hormonal waves. And mind the pups. They are born with a primitive instinct and might bite. Ensure they are separated from the mothers immediately until they can be calmed.\"\n\nElara's choked sob next to me amplifies the unease in the room. But my own body feels distant, detached, as though I'm floating somewhere above the scene, watching it unfold below.\n\nElise, the one whose body was once mine, carries triplets. Because of my prolonged exposure to goblin pheromones prior to impregnation, the wizard explains that my spawn are larger, more robust. Elara, on the other hand, was impregnated before her body was fully ‘in heat,’ which means her pups will be weaker, unlikely to survive long on their own.\n\nSnib growls at this, a hint of anger flashing in his eyes. My heart aches, a sensation of longing and sadness wrapping around me, tethering me to Snib.\n\nZephyrion’s cold gaze lands on me, and with his rod, he measures my collar. A chill runs down my spine. There’s something bigger at play here. It's not about the goblin pups to the wizard, not really. It's about the connection, the link Snib and I share, magnified by the collar and the children I bear him.[Choice: He gives another command.",

My birthing attire, if you can even call it that, consists of a sheer cloth that's draped across my chest, barely containing the weight of my breasts, which are swollen and leaking with milk. Every contraction makes them jiggle, as droplets of milk drip down, staining the cloth.\n\nAbove me, I grip onto a rope, my knuckles white from the strain. It's there to help leverage the force I need to push these abominations out of my body. Beside me, Elara, her beautiful auburn hair plastered to her face, is in a similar state, gripping her rope and wailing in agony.\n\nThe midwives rush between the two of us, their eyes wide with a mixture of horror and determination. They’ve probably never been part of such an obscene scene, where the joy of childbirth is replaced with terror and grotesquerie.\n\nAs the next contraction hits, I can't help but scream out, my back arching in pain. One of the midwives, her hands trembling slightly, moves to check my progress. I can feel her fingers, cool and firm, and then her sharp intake of breath as she feels the scaly head of one of the goblin triplets. \"It's coming!\" she shouts, signaling to her colleagues.\n\nBeside me, Elara's screams join mine, creating a haunting chorus that fills the room. Her body strains and shudders, fighting to bring forth Snib’s spawn. Her own midwife braces herself, her hands coated in some slick substance, preparing to receive the smaller goblin offspring.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nZephyrion watches from the shadows, a statue of indifferences, cold eyes fixated on the obscene spectacle. Snib, on the other hand, can barely contain his glee, his yellow eyes shining with pride as he welcomes his monstrosities into the world.\n\nElara’s cries crescendo as her first goblin child emerges, smaller than mine but no less grotesque. Her body trembles, and milk spills from her chest, a stark contrast to the dark leather of her outfit.\n\nThe entire chamber reeks of sweat, blood, and the metallic scent of birth. Glistening fluids and blood stain the floor as, one by one, the goblin children are delivered into the world.\n\nFinally, after what feels like an eternity, the last of my triplets emerges, its wailing cries joining those of its siblings. I collapse backward, exhaustion taking over, my body feeling empty yet scarred from the ordeal.\n\nThe midwives, their expressions a mixture of relief and horror, quickly wrap the goblin whelps in cloths, separating them from us, and Snib moves to inspect each one, his crooked fingers gently caressing their grotesque faces.[Choice: It's done.",

      "text": "--- Chapter 19: The Descent ---\n\nThe home owned by Aldric the Great, monster slayer, is now a goblin nursery.\n\nMy head swims, every breath I take filled with goblin-musk, intensifying the unnatural haze clouding my thoughts. Snib’s ever-present pheromones make everything feel hyper-sensitive, from the feeling of the soft sheets beneath me to the rough pull on my massive, engorged tits.\n\nI look down, watching in a mix of horror and unwanted pleasure, as two of my monstrously large goblin offspring greedily suckle at my teats. They're alarmingly big, and not gentle in how they latch on. Their skin is a mottled green, their little fingers rough and grippy, clenching onto the vast expanse of my breasts, manipulating and kneading the flesh in their insistent demand for milk.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nThe sensation of hormone-fueled warmth spreading through my body is both indescribable and deeply disturbing. It begins as a spreading heat from deep within my engorged breasts, a heat that burns brighter with each suck and pull from the oversized goblin whelps attached to my nipples. Each pull sends a jolt of sensation that transcends simple physical reactions, tapping into something instinctual and primal within me.\n\nThe babies, excessively strong for their size, grapple with my breasts, their tiny but rough hands grasping at my flesh, kneading and squeezing with innate ferocity. Their yellow eyes glare up at me, almost in defiance as they drink. I can feel every pull, every tug, the flow of milk surging from me in amounts that leave me dizzy.\n\n\"Ah! Be gentle,\" I moan, though the sound that escapes me is thick with the confusing mix of discomfort and release.\n\nFrom the bedside, Snib watches, his leering eyes missing nothing. His laugh is rough, filled with crude delight.\n\n\"Haha, look at them tug at those human udders. Drink up, my strong lads! Grow big and fierce on this rich, sluttish cream. Ain't nothing better than a human cow's milk to make a goblin hardy!\"\n\nI can't help but moan softly with every forceful tug, pull, suck, and nibble. My body is raging with a mess of hormones that makes thinking about anything else utterly impossible.\n\nMilk flows in steady, hot streams, the sensation nearly electric in its intensity, amplified by the cocktail of hormones and pheromones flooding my veins. Each gulp they take is accompanied by a demanding tug that feels like it's pulling at the core of my being.\n\nBeside me, Elara is in a similar state, though one of my more domineering offspring has taken over one of her breasts, leaving her own two goblin children to fight over her remaining nipple.\n\nThe sight of my wife feeding these creatures, her once-proud face flushed with the same mixture of humiliation and perverse fulfillment I feel, *should* be deeply unsettling.\n\n\"Yer doing good, bitches,\" Snib continues, leaning closer to inspect how the babies nurse. \"Remember, get that nipple right down their throats, or the little buggers might snap 'em off. Ain’t nice to have a gobbo baby angry for more milk.\"\n\nElara next to me groans under the strain, her face contorted with a mixture of pain and ecstasy. Her less-experienced whelps are clumsier, their tugs sharp and uneven, causing her noticeable discomfort. As one particularly eager suck pulls her nipple too harshly, she lets out a yelp, her eyes squeezing shut in agony.\n\nSnib laughs, a sound devoid of warmth. \"Look at ye... wasn't wrong calling ye cow tits, eh? Just natural for this, filling up my lads with rich, creamy feed.\"\n\nThe room echoes with our soft moaning and the steady, rhythmic gulping of the hungry goblin babies. Each tug, each pull is a reminder of our complete and utter subjugation, our bodies no longer our own but mere vessels for Snib's grotesque progeny.\n\nThe warmth in my breasts, the burn of hormones, feels like a fire—an inferno consuming my sense of self, leaving behind nothing but the primal, base need to nurture and nurse, even if the recipients of such care are the spawn of a creature I would have slain without hesitation in another life.\n\nZephyrion stands to the side, his gaze not on the obscene sight of our nursing, but intently focused on the cursed collar snugly wrapped around my neck as he takes measurements with the arcanameter.\n\nThere's an air of concentration about him, as if he's piecing together some complex puzzle.\n\nSnib, meanwhile, is always hovering close, ensuring his pups get the mealtime every 2 hours, morning, noon and night. He grins, his yellow eyes darting between Elara and me, clearly enjoying our biological subservience to his offspring.\n\nElara and I moan in tandem, our voices filled with a mix of pain and unwanted ecstasy. The sensation is overwhelming, a never-ending flow of milk, the forceful latching and sucking of the goblin whelps driving us deeper into the hazy fog. My tits jiggle with every movement.\n\nFinally, Zephyrion breaks his contemplative silence. \"The act of nursing... it's feeding the collar's energy,\" he muses.\n\n\"Easy, easy... ah!\" Elara gasps, wincing as one of hers yanks hard.\n\nSnib moves between us, his hands crudely patting our heads as if we were prized livestock. \"Can you feel them growing stronger with every sip? Fattening up on yer nectar?\"\n\nAs the goblin whelps' insistent feeding continues, my breasts start to feel sore, the sensation of being drained becoming more pronounced. \"Their milk supply is dwindling,\" Zephyrion observes.\n\nThe smirk on Snib's face broadens, his yellow eyes glinting with mischief. \"Looks like ya need a bit of replenishing, don't ya?\"[Choice: It's time for *your* feeding.",

That is, until the grunting of the goblin takes over.\n\nWithout ceremony, Snib hops up onto the bed and pushes aside his loincloth, revealing his fully-erect cock.\n\nIt's slick with precum, the purple tip glistening in the dim light of the room. The smell of his arousal is overpowering, even more pungent than his usual musk.\n\nInstinctively, her hand wraps around the base of his shaft, pumping rhythmically as she suckles on the head. The obscene squelching noises fill the room.\n\nI can't look away. I, too, am trapped in this hazy dream. Everything about our lives is just sensations, overwhelming hormones, and foggy visions.\n\nFeeling Snib's pheromones so intensely, the pull of my own biological needs grows stronger, the collar's influence and the goblin's musk making it nearly impossible to focus on anything but thinking about another full, nourishing load from his balls.\n\nEvery suck, every moan from Elara, every grunt from Snib, sends a jolt of unwanted pleasure through me. Snib's laughter rings in my ears, his enjoyment of our debasement evident.\n\nThe goblin's hands tighten in Elara's red hair, holding her in place as his fat, green cock throbs in her mouth. I can't tear my eyes away from the horrifying scene, the tightening of the muscles in Snib's pudgy body as he tenses and releases with each spurt. My heart races, the sound of it thumping in my ears drowns out all but the lewd noises in front of me.\n\n\"Master's got a big, hearty meal for his favorite bitch.\"\n\nElara whimpers, her body quivering as she looks up at Snib, her lips stretched wide. Her hands, trembling, clutch at his thighs as if he's her source of life.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\nMy body thrums with fascination and need. Snib's musk sends intoxicating signals to my deep, dark places. The humid, air thickens, heavy with the scent of imminent release.\n\nSnib grunts. Elara's lips tighten around the engorged head of his penis, trying to prepare.\n\nThen Snib's body stiffens, his balls clench visibly, drawing up toward his body in a grotesque display of goblin virility.\n\n\"Now, be a good cow and suck it down,\" he barks, as he begins to unload.\n\nElara's body convulses with her own squirting orgasm, triggered by the biological reaction to her oral insemination. It's messy, loud—her juices splatter out, intermingling with the noises of Snib’s continued ejaculation.\n\n\"Oh, fuck yeh... take it all, ye busty wench!\" Snib growls, his thrusts shallow but forceful, ensuring every drop is deposited deep in her throat. \"Drink it up... good for ya... makes more milk for the pups, dunnit?\"\n\nElara's eyes water as she chugs the thick, putrid spunk filling her mouth. Some of the cum dribbles out the corners of her mouth, trailing down her chin in a disgraceful display.\n\n\"Glurk... mmmph...\" she manages, muffled noises escaping as she swallows hungrily, driven by the deep-seated biological craving instilled by Snib's pheromones.\n\nI watch, fixated, feeling a piercing stab of jealousy.\n\nI need it, too. But Master always feeds her first.\n\nMy body aches for that stinky, thick sludge, screaming at me that it's essential, nourishing.\n\nAs Snib finishes, wiping his tip on Elara’s chin, he steps back, a satisfied smirk on his face.\n\n\"Nothing like feeding a hungry bitch...\" he chuckles, wiping his now-flaccid cock on the back of Elara’s hand. \"Ready for yers tits-for-brains?\"\n\nElara coughs, wiping her mouth, trying to gather her composure. Snib's pubic hairs stick grotesquely to her sticky lips. She takes deep, shaking breaths, her eyes glazed but alive with a disturbing gratitude.\n\n\"Yes, Master... thank you, Master,\" I say.[Choice: It's your turn.",

Her face is slick with sweat and streaked with the remnants of Snib’s heavy load. The smell of his cum fills the air, thick and overpowering.\n\nWith a lewd grin, Snib turns and waddles over to where I am seated. His eyes glint maliciously as he approaches.\n\n\"Your turn, tits-for-brains,\" he snarls as he grabs my hair and roughly yanks me forward. \"Open wide. It's feeding time.\"\n\nI tilt my head back, opening my mouth wide. There's a moment of hesitation—but then Snib's huge, throbbing cock is pressing against my lips. I can feel it pulsating, growing harder by the second, its heat almost scalding against the sensitive flesh of my mouth.\n\nHe doesn't enter gently. Instead, he grabs the back of my head, his fingers tangling in my hair, and shoves his massive length deep into my throat.\n\nWith his small, muscular legs straddling the back of the chair I'm sitting in, he begins to piston his cock in and out with vigorous thrusts. Each movement forces his monstrous girth deeper, stretching my throat wide around him as he humps my face.\n\n\"Take it, you slut,\" Snib sneers, looking down at me with open contempt. \"Always rougher for the bitch hero.\"\n\nI choke and sputter, tears springing to my eyes from the sheer force of his thrusts. His massive balls smack against my chin with every push, the slap of flesh echoing in the otherwise silent room.\n\nI force myself to relax my throat, accommodating his size, feeling him slide deeper with each thrust. It's a struggle, each breath a gasping fight for air, each swallow pushing him further into the depths of my throat.\n\nBut then, a sudden memory flashes into my mind, piercing the lustful haze that's been clouding my judgment: Master Fendril's Moonshade potion! He had instructed me, with grave emphasis, to start consuming it as soon as I was no longer pregnant. Panic wells up within me, intertwining with the heavy arousal that's consumed my body.\n\nSnib's rhythm is punishing, the squelching of his fat cock in my mouth a lewd soundtrack to the scene. Desperation and pleasure war within me as Snib's heavy cockhead nudges the bottom of my throat with each thrust. I can taste his impending release - bitter, salty, and overwhelmingly pungent, laced with the telltale tang of goblin pheromones that make my head swim.\n\nJust as I think I can't take anymore, Snib gives a victorious squeal.\n\n\"Drink up, whore!\" he shouts, and then his cock swells, and I feel the first heavy splurt of his cum shooting directly into my stomach.\n\nIt bypasses my taste buds completely, a pressure-injected torrent of thick, stinky goblin spunk filling my belly. The warmth of it spreads instantly, a scalding heat that makes my stomach churn.\n\nSnib continues to unload, his body shuddering with each release, his grunts turning to raspy pants. His balls tighten against my chin, signaling the final throes of his ejaculation, and I feel my own body responding in kind.\n\nThe room spins as an orgasm, humiliating in its intensity, tears through me. I squirt, the release messy and uncontrollable, gushing over the chair and onto the floor. My body quivers with aftershocks, each one echoing the overwhelming sensation of being filled with Snib's cum.\n\nSnib pulls out slowly, a satisfied grunt escaping him as he watches me gasp for air, cum dribbling down my chin. \"There's your meal, slut. Right in the gut. Bet you feel nice and full now, eh?\"\n\nHe wipes his semi-flaccid cock on my cheek before hopping off the chair.\n\n\"Now clean up. Ye got an hour before yer feedin the pups again.\"\n\nI'm left gasping, breathless and violated, my body coated in sweat, spit, and cum.\n\nI can feel it, the way his sperm invigorates my body, the way it rekindles the burning desire within me, and the way it stimulates my milk production, replenishing what's been taken. The world around me becomes even more hazy, more blurred by the overwhelming sensations brought on by Snib's powerful release.\n\nElara stirs on the bed, lifting her head weakly. Her eyes meet mine. But words fail us both, the gravity of our situation leaving us drowning in a sea of pleasure and submission.[Choice: Later...",

My tits, swollen to an unbearable size and leaking milk once again, sway heavily with each step, their weight pulling my chest forward, the slight movement causing pangs of pain from the bite marks and scratches that mar them.\n\nThe pups had been ravenous, latching onto my nipples with a ferocity I wasn't prepared for. They gnawed, sucked, and pulled without a care for the body they were attached to. My once-pink nipples are now a deep shade of purple, swollen and engorged with milk, while the surrounding skin is littered with marks from their sharp little teeth.\n\nThe gown I'm in, generously provided by the midwives, hangs loosely around my recovering body. It's a soft, flowing material, cut in a way to accommodate my ever-burgeoning chest and to make nursing more accessible. The outfit, even though soft, grazes against my tender breasts, making me wince.\n\nThe kitchen looms before me, looking far more gobliny than it used to. Utensils and ingredients are haphazardly strewn around, a testament to the disorderly life Snib has forced upon us.\n\nDust and filth coat the countertops, the once immaculate space tarnished by neglect. Counters that used to be full of fresh ingredients are now stocked with bottles of milk and stored goblin semen.\n\nI can't even remember the last time I saw the shimmering silverware and polished wooden bowls in their proper places. The memory of our immaculate kitchen, kept perfectly organized by Elara, is distant. We have both changed too much.\n\nDesperation fuels my search for the Moonshade. I rifle through the drawers, my fingers trembling, nails scratching the wooden surfaces. I need it.\n\nI have to find it. Something drives me.\n\nI've hid it somewhere, and with every passing second, my hope dwindles.\n\nMemories flood my mind - it was a couple months ago, Snib was distracted by Elara's supple body, and I had a moment alone. I remember stashing it... but where? In the haze of arousal and subjugation, I had forgotten.\n\nThen, finally, something glitters out of the corner of my eye.\n\nBehind the stack of filthy goblets and underneath a ragged dishcloth, my fingers brush against the smooth vial.

Snib’s relentless pheromones infesting my body press down on my senses, skewing my perceptions, urging me to throw the vial aside.\n\nThe smell of the Moonshade itself is jarringly intense: a sharp, minty scent that clashes with the heavy, animalistic odor that’s become my new norm. My stomach twists as I bring the open vial closer.\n\nDeep within, something stirs - though I don't even know what it is.\n\nMy wrist shakes as I hold the vial aloft, my gaze locked onto its contents. Memories rush back in hazy waves—the feel of my sword in hand, the pride of standing against darkness, the love for my wife that transcended physical form. I cling to these fragments, desperate for the strength they once lent me.\n\nWith every inch the vial nears my lips, my body revolts. My throat tightens, an instinctive response to reject what my pheromone-addled brain perceives as poison. I hesitate, the vial wavering, a drop poised at the brim, ready to fall back into the reservoir of salvation it came from.\n\nBut I stop.\n\n“No,” I whisper to myself, a faint vestige of my former command in the faltering tone. “Not reduced to... this.”\n\nSummoning a sliver of will from the depths of my being, I grit my teeth, my free hand clutching the edge of the counter for support. Every muscle in my body screams in protest.\n\nWith a trembling resolve, I finally bring the vial to my plush, swollen lips.

Yet as the minty coolness spreads, branching like frost on a windowpane across the haze of my thoughts, I gasp. Air—clean, crisp, free—fills my lungs - and it feels different.\n\nAnd then, the tiniest pinprick of true clarity pierces the veil.\n\nMy hands no longer tremble. My vision seems to sharpen; Snib’s snores from the other room suddenly paint the picture more vividly of my grotesque, horrible reality.\n\nWith every beat of my slowly steadying heart, the remnants of the haze fight back, a nasty curl of pheromones attempting to smother me.\n\n“I will not be this creature’s thing,” I assert quietly, my voice gaining strength. “Not anymore.”\n\nThe battle within is just beginning, but armed with the Moonshade, I dare to hope, to fight.[Choice: Go upstairs.",

Every step feels like I'm dancing on the edge of a blade, balancing between saving Elara and the jaws of a trap set by Snib.\n\nAs I reach the edge of the bed, the dim light from the moon seeps through the curtains, revealing the grotesque scene before me. The vile goblin has his fat, flaccid cock casually draped over Elara's slender leg, a perverse mark of ownership. His grotesque form snuggles against my beautiful wife, their bodies meshed together in a mockery of intimacy. The sight makes my heart pound, a combination of dread, disgust, and jealousy.\n\nEmotions that feel new to me, like an infant learning to walk.\n\nQuietly, ever so quietly, I unscrew the vial. Its faint glow lights up the tiny space around it, casting eerie, dancing shadows. My massive breasts sway heavily as I lean forward, brushing softly against the sheets. The movement nearly causes the vial to slip from my fingers. My heart stops. But it remains clutched in my sweaty palm.\n\nMy gaze flits to Snib, ensuring he hasn’t stirred.\n\nI'm inches away from Elara, her soft lips slightly parted in slumber. I've seen those lips laugh, cry, and kiss. Now, they need to swallow the Moonshade.\n\nWith shaking hands, I drip a few drops into Elara's mouth, praying it’s enough. As the last droplet leaves the vial, Elara stirs, her eyelids fluttering. Panic swells in my chest. I freeze, tits still dangling, eyes locked on her. A soft moan escapes her lips, and for a moment, I think she's waking. But it's just a simple shift in her dream state, and her breathing remains even.\n\nHowever, the soft shuffle of Snib's feet draws my attention. He murmurs something incomprehensible, stirring slightly. I feel like a trapped animal, my heart thundering so loudly I'm sure it will give me away. But after what feels like an eternity, his breathing steadies, and his grotesque form stills.\n\nThe immediate danger passed, I slowly, so slowly, move back, careful not to let my ample body give away my position. My tits, heavy and pendulous, sway with my motion but thankfully don't catch on anything.\n\nOnce I'm sure I've retreated enough, I slide into my spot on the bed, laying down on the opposite side from the grotesque duo. My mind races, trying to calm my raging heart. I pray to any god listening that the Moonshade works its magic on Elara, that by morning she will see Snib for the monster he truly is.\n\nI tuck the vial back under my pillow.

And hopefully my wife will too.\n\nThe sunlight filtering through the window illuminates the room. I can hear the distant, hungry squeals of our goblin pups coming from upstairs. As much as I want to block out their sounds, I can't. My own body betrays me as I feel a dampness forming around my nipples, milk soaking the front of my gown.\n\n“Ugh,” I groan.\n\nI glance at Elara, her chest rising and falling in rhythm with her breathing. Her eyes flutter open, immediately locking with mine. Her nostrils flaring.\n\n\"Elise,\" she whispers, her voice trembling, \"Are you...?\"\n\n\"Yes, Elara,\" I nod, trying to hold back tears. \"The haze... it's gone.\"\n\nThe squeals from the goblin pups grow louder. A nagging urge to feed them pulses within me, but my newfound clarity battles that urge. I don't want to nurse them. Neither does Elara.\n\nSnib groggily awakens, yawning wide. \"Mornin', cow tits,\" he smirks, groping at my breast without any hesitation. I recoil, and his hand finds empty air. His yellow eyes narrow, glancing between Elara and me.\n\nElara, gently pushing herself to sit up, brushes off Snib's hand as he tries to caress her face. \"Don't touch me,\" she says with a steadiness I've not heard in a while.\n\nSnib's face contorts into a confused sneer. \"Oi, what's gotten into you, sugar tits?

Look at her,\" he jabs a dirty finger toward my collar, reminding me of the ever-present threat, \"that collar still works, you know. One squeeze and she's done for.\"\n\nElara's defiant gaze softens momentarily, concern for me evident in her eyes. She leans closer to Snib, her voice dripping with venom. \"Remember, Snib, you might have your toys, but you need us just as much as you think we need you. If Elise dies, you die.”\n\nWith a grunt, Snib jumps off the bed, adjusting his swollen loincloth. \"Enjoy yer little moment of rebellion,\" he spits, stalking off toward the kitchen, “it’s not gonna last.\"[Choice: He leaves.",

Ye promised their safety!\"\n\nMy heart pounds in my chest. There’s no doubt in my mind about what he's referring to. We’re only just recovering from our frenzied lust, and now this. One problem after another.\n\nI cautiously enter the room, with Elara by my side, clutching my hand tightly for support. Zephyrion stands ahead, his tall frame outlined by the chamber’s torchlight, and those stormy grey eyes immediately fixate on us.\n\nThe room feels charged, tension crackling like an approaching storm. Snib stands there, his green face flushed with anger.\n\n\"They killed 'em! They killed my pups!\" he screams, pointing one stubby finger accusingly at us.\n\nThe wizard’s gaze pierces through us. \"Is this true?\" he asks in that quiet, yet forceful tone of his.\n\nI shake my head, glancing at Elara, \"The whelps... fell ill,\" I mutter. \"They were weak and just... stopped breathing. We didn’t do anything.\"\n\nBefore I could react, I feel a sharp sting on my ass as Snib slaps it hard. The sensation reverberates through my body, making my voluptuous frame quiver. A mixture of pain and shame shoots up my spine, but a perverse sense of pleasure causes a smirk to tug at my lips. The stinging heat remains, even as the initial pain fades.\n\n\"Enough!\" Zephyrion's voice slices through the room, causing even Snib to pause. \"You forget your place, goblin.\"\n\nI glance at Snib, waiting for him to explode in further anger, but instead, he glares at Zephyrion.\n\n\"They been actin' all uppity since yesterday. Like they ain't affected by me scent no more.\"\n\nZephyrion narrows his eyes, and the room goes silent. \"Moonshade,\" he says coolly.\n\nSnib's beady eyes widen. \"But you said... You promised there'd be no more of that potion left in Eboncrest!\"\n\nThe wizard remains impassive, though something calculating passes over his features. \"It appears they had... help,\" he muses, casting a long, thoughtful look our way. The weight of those eyes causes my heart to race, and a chill runs down my spine.\n\nThe high-pitched, ear-piercing shriek of Snib makes my head swim, and all too suddenly, I feel the cursed metal collar tightening around my throat.\n\nThe pressure builds, and I gasp, my hands clutching at the unyielding collar. It's getting harder and harder to breathe. Panicking, I stagger, my vision blurring. The world swims in and out of focus.\n\nZephyrion, cold as the winter winds, regards Snib with a disdainful look. His stormy grey eyes narrow.\n\n\"There is a unique torment I've often used on the Serrans, a particularly... exquisite method of prolonged suffering,\" he starts, his voice dripping with ice. \"It involves the spiraling extraction of a victim's essence, slowly unraveling their very soul strand by strand, as their physical body begins to rot. By the end of it, after days of unyielding torment, the victim is left an empty husk, their spirit shattered, and their body decayed.\"\n\nWith a flick of his fingers, a minuscule vortex, a miniature storm of black and blue, appears before him. The swirling vortex is alive, its energies pulsating and beckoning, pulling at my very core.\n\nThe demonstration of such a horrific technique chills me to the bone. This sort of magical torture is not a spell I would've expected a royal wizard to employ.\n\n\"The collar,\" Zephyrion's voice drops even lower, every word deliberate, \"is a partially intelligent artifact. It senses threats, and I suggest it perceives the gravity of my words very clearly.\" He pauses, letting the weight of his threat hang in the charged air, \"You'd do well to remember, Snib, I've put too much at stake with this artifact to let it be ruined by the tantrums of a little green freak.”\n\nIt's like a switch flips. Slowly, blessedly, the metal collar loosens. I drag in deep, desperate breaths, my body shuddering with each inhale.\n\nZephyrion's mouth curls up in the barest hint of a smile, the satisfaction evident in his gaze.\n\n\"Predictable,\" he murmurs. \"But given the breaking of the maternal bond, and the possible presence of Moonshade,\" his stormy eyes flit to me, suspicion clouding their depths, \"it seems we must expedite our plans.\"\n\nSnib's yellow eyes widen in horror. \"Wha'?! But—\"\n\n\"Silence,\" Zephyrion commands, and the room immediately grows colder, \"We leave for Ironrock today. My scholars have been working diligently to uncover the ancient sanctum there, and it's time we made use of it.\"\n\n“What about me protection?!\" Snib protests.\n\nZephyrion's reply is calculated, offering the goblin no room for argument. \"You will remain under my protection, even after this is over. As long as you keep your temper in check.\"\n\nThe wizard’s face when he lies, is indistinguishable from when he tells the truth.\n\nSnib, seething with suppressed rage, finally just turns on his heel and stalks out of the room. His heavy footfalls echoing off the stone floors.\n\nThen, Zephyrion shifts his focus to Elara and me, the weight of his gaze making my spine stiffen. \"I understand what you've done,\" he says softly, \"but you've made a grievous error.\"\n\nHe speaks a command. In march royal guards, their armor gleaming in the dim light, their expressions stone-cold. They stand ready, awaiting their orders.\n\n\"Prepare them for the journey,\" Zephyrion orders, his attention already moving on to the next pressing matter.[Choice: You must depart.",

The Eboncrest guard - Aldric’s longtime friend - jogs alongside, eyes wide, bushy beard bouncing with each stride.\n\n\"To Ironrock,\" I reply. A solitary crow caws overhead. “To where it all began.”\n\nZephyrion, regal in his indigo robes, rides at the head of this grim parade, a look of purpose and dark intent etched onto his features.\n\nBehind him, his royal guards make a formidable sight. Sunlight dances off their polished helmets and shimmering breastplates. Among them, archaeologists clutch scrolls and satchels, deep in whispered conversation about the wonders of the ancient world they are about to uncover.\n\nElara, on her horse, looks as tense as I feel. Our matching leather armor hugs our post-pregnancy figures.\n\nThe gentle trotting of my steed causes my ample chest to sway and jiggle.

Faces etched in worry peer from windows, doorways, and market stalls. Children halt their play to watch the procession, eyes wide and questioning. They can sense the magnitude of our journey, even if they don't understand it.\n\n\"Hold!\" Mayor Bramble's voice rings out, and the procession comes to a sudden halt. He steps forward, his face a mask of fury. \"Zephyrion, I've been told what you're planning. This... this is madness! This is not what we agreed!”\n\nZephyrion regards the mayor with cold detachment. \"It's what's necessary for Valaria, Bramble. The war against Sirath demands it.\"\n\n\"You're toying with forces you can't comprehend! Awakening Maraan will bring ruin upon us all,\" Bramble spits, his voice trembling with anger and fear.\n\nZephyrion's response is a slow, sinister smile. \"Power always demands sacrifice, Mayor. And I'm willing to make it. You will be rewarded for Eboncrest’s contributions, the king is most appreciative.”\n\nWith that, he spurs his horse forward, the procession resuming its somber march. I exchange a glance with Elara, the weight of our journey pressing down upon us.\n\nThe gates of Eboncrest groan in the wind as we pass through them, leaving behind the security of the town walls. Ahead lies the wild expanse, the dense pine forest beckoning us with a mix of wonder and menace. The gentle rustling of the pine needles overhead whispers secrets of ancient times, while the deep shadows between the trees hint at the mysteries they conceal.\n\nJarkrond's hooves, beneath Snib's weight, sound oddly muffled on the forest floor.

Hours pass, but the ominous weight in the air makes it feel like an eternity. As we continue, the woods gradually give way to a clearing, revealing the gaping maw of Ironrock Mine.\n\nBefore the mine entrance, I see evidence of the ongoing excavation. Crates upon crates of unearthed artifacts litter the area. K'tarran stones, with their distinct dark hue and eerie glow, are stacked methodically. The intricate carvings on some depict grotesque figures, twisted in pain or perhaps ecstasy. There's an oppressive energy emanating from them, chilling the air and making the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.\n\nArchaeologists, in deep conversation, hover around certain finds, their hands gesturing wildly as they debate the meanings of the relics. Their robes are splattered with dirt, their faces alight with the frenzied excitement of discovery.\n\nYet, amidst the academic fervor, a looming dread is palpable. The very earth seems to groan beneath the weight of the K'tarran secrets being dragged to the surface.\n\nZephyrion, his eyes brighter than ever, surveys the scene. Every artifact, every carving, seems to draw him in deeper, fueling his insatiable hunger for power and knowledge. And as we dismount, preparing to delve into the mine's depths, the darkness ahead seems all the more foreboding, whispering promises of revelations that Zaelasia might be better off not knowing.\n\nMy heart races. I can feel the cold, hard metal of the collar biting into my neck.\n\nThe wizard turns to address his men, and his eyes – cold and determined – settle on me for a brief moment.\n\n\"Men and women of the crown, and keepers of history, today is the culmination of our hard work, of our sacrifices. You have all followed me loyally, believing in our cause, and today that belief will be rewarded. The temple deep within this mine holds a force that has been dormant for too long. The ancient god, Maraan, has slept in shadow, but with the arcanameter's power, and the unique connection between this goblin and Elise, we have the means to awaken this deity.\"\n\nI can't help but shiver, thinking about what we are going to see down there. The weight of his words is heavy, pressing down on me, and I can feel the gazes of his soldiers on me, as well.\n\nHe continues, \"Elise, I recognize the trials you've endured, the humiliation and pain, all to be here at this pivotal moment.\" Zephyrion’s eyes lock onto mine, a chilling smile on his lips. \"Your suffering, Aldric’s transformation, your strength; none of it will have been in vain. Our world is on the precipice of change, and all that you've endured will be but a small price for the greatness that is to come.\"\n\nSwallowing hard, every fiber of my being wants to scream, to shout, to rebel against this monstrous man and his grand plan.

Torches are quickly lit, casting a flickering amber hue over the assembly. It dances hesitantly upon the rocky walls, revealing the traces of the past. Here and there, rusted tools lay abandoned, a testament to the desperate hunt for ore and the riches it promised. Yet, as we move deeper, the remnants of Aldric's quest emerge, shattered goblin weaponry, and worn pathways, leading to the ancient tunnels I remember so vividly.\n\nI glance over at Elara, her auburn hair cascading down, glinting with firelight. We’re both wrapped in tailored armor, painstakingly designed by Zephyrion's personal craftsman. My outfit clings to every curve, crafted for my… unique shape. The leather hugs my form, its straps crisscrossing my back, offering the support my heavy breasts desperately need. It's strange; the armor's designed not just for protection, but for comfort, each piece meticulously placed to ensure nothing jiggles excessively. It makes me realize that, for all Zephyrion's evils, he understands the necessity of keeping his 'assets' safe.\n\nA sensation of constriction reminds me of the bandage beneath my armor, wrapped tightly around my post-pregnancy stomach by the skilled hands of midwives. The wrapping helps, offering some support to muscles still recovering from the trauma of birthing goblin spawn, an unnatural process that left both physical and emotional scars.\n\nElara carries herself with the grace and elegance one would expect of a queen, even if her kingdom has been usurped. She still has such beauty and poise, despite all we’ve endured.\n\nBehind us, I can hear the slithering shuffle of Snib's footsteps. I resist the urge to glance back but can feel his grotesque gaze leering at my ass. It's a small reminder of the humiliations we've been subjected to, but today, I hold my head high, refusing to let his presence dominate my thoughts.\n\nThe air begins to grow colder, denser.\n\nSounds seem muffled, every footstep echoing back at us in the tight confines of the passage. The further we go, the clearer the signs become of Zephyrion's intent. Recent dig sites appear sporadically, and the scattered detritus of recent excavation activity lies all around. Piles of freshly unearthed rubble are a stark contrast to the ancient, foreboding tunnels they've revealed. The whispers of long-dead souls seem to cling to the air, a mournful chorus warning of the dark secrets that lay dormant below.\n\nA heavy sense of anticipation builds with each step. This isn't just a mine; it's a descent into a forgotten realm, a journey into the very heart of ancient darkness. The weight of centuries of history, of hidden rituals and slumbering deities, presses down on us, urging us to turn back, but we press on, determined, fearful, but resolute in the face of the looming unknown.[Choice: The cavern opens...",

The very air feels thick, laden with ancient whispers and the weight of time. The ceiling of the colossal cavern is draped with countless stalactites, dripping with the tears of epochs. The sheer vastness swallows all light, turning the vast space into a maw of shadows.\n\nEverywhere, dead relics of the K'Tarrans sprawl – monolithic structures, defying the ages, holding the secrets of a civilization that breathed its last millennia ago. Skeletal frameworks of incomplete excavations can be seen, the modern world attempting to pierce the veil of the ancient. Tattered tents, tools, and half-etched notes betray the hasty endeavors of archaeologists, trying to decipher the hieroglyphs and the cryptic tales etched in stone.\n\nThe pathway, illuminated by our torches, leads us into the very heart of this cavernous realm, revealing an underground temple of staggering proportions. Great pillars, etched with grotesque figures and symbols, rise from the ground, disappearing into the encompassing darkness above. There's an uncomfortable sensation, an uncanny feeling that the very stones and statues watch our every move.\n\nAs we venture deeper, the grotesque statues become more pronounced, depicting beings of indescribable horror, their forms twisting and merging in impossible ways.

His touch sends a wave of revulsion through me, my skin recoiling under his grubby fingers, yet I grit my teeth, swallowing the disgust and the knee-jerk reaction to fight back. The collar bites into my skin, a cold reminder of the chains that bind me.\n\nThe wizard brandishes the arcanameter, its surface etched with glowing runes that dance in the gloomy light. He lowers the rod into a brass tripod, the metal gleaming ominously under the wavering torchlight. It stands there, a silent sentinel, a conduit that threatens to rip open the world and awaken what should be left to sleep.\n\nZephyrion's hand stretches forward, fingertips dancing in the air, drawing symbols only his eyes can see. His voice, soft but commanding, fills the space around us. A frigid energy spins out from him, weaving through the air, sending a prickling sensation across my skin. His incantations resonate through the cavern, wrapping around my heartbeat, filling the air with a malignant harmony.\n\nWith his final utterance, the air pulses, rippling outward from his fingertips. The ripple sinks into the arcanameter, and a connection forms, a visible tether of light linking the crystal rod to my collar.\n\nThe rod starts to hum, a low, thrumming vibration that echoes my pounding heartbeat, filling the cavern with a perverse symphony. The humming intensifies as the energy inside the arcanameter begins to rise, illuminated by a soft, ethereal light. The transparent rod begins to glow with a life of its own, the light spiraling up, tracing the arcane runes, filling it like a crystal vial with each throb of my heart.\n\nZephyrion's eyes flicker with a cruel delight, shifting between the arcanameter, my collar, and the glowing tether binding us together. His gaze probes, assessing the connection, the flow of energy it carries. The tether draws energy from me, siphoning it through the collar, then feeding it into the arcanameter. Each heartbeat, each shiver, each thought seems to amplify the glow within the rod.\n\nA harsh force grips me, paralyzing me in place. It's the arcanameter, its magical field radiating out, its tether securing me like a beast for slaughter. Each breath, each flicker of thought seems to be echoed by the humming rod, its light pulsating with the rhythm of my heartbeat and Snib's obscene gestures. Every twitch of the goblin, every graze of his filthy hand against my body, is echoed in the tether's pulse, in the hum of the arcanameter, in the rising light within the crystal rod.\n\nHis next command rings out, harsh and impatient, \"Bring forth the Empyreal Ark!\" Soldiers and archaeologists scurry, the hushed whispers drowned in the ominous humming of the arcanameter.\n\nThe soldiers lift the ark into the light of the glowing arcanameter, the sight of it sending a chill down my spine. It’s a device meant to harness and store vast amounts of magical energy. I've seen its smaller cousins, Ether Arks, on the battlefield, packed full of magic and ready to give our mages a swift kick of power in the heat of battle. But those Ether Arks were small, compact things, easy to carry and deploy. This one... it's enormous.\n\nIt's a wicked looking thing too, all jagged edges and gleaming black stone, adorned with golden filigree in symbols I don't recognize. It seems clear that it was specifically designed for a divine level of energy.\n\nMy gaze darts from the ark to the humming arcanameter, the magical tether linking my collar to it shimmering in the torchlight. I can feel the slight pull, as if the arcanameter is trying to draw something out of me. I fight the urge to pull away, to rip that tether out.\n\nNot that I could.[Choice: Try to stay calm.",

For a moment, we draw strength from each other, and I brace myself for what's coming next.\n\nThe torchlight flutters as though agitated, casting monstrous shadows across the vaulted ceilings. The statue of Maraan, lit by the sickly glow of the arcanameter, almost seems to shudder.\n\nThe collar, the arcanameter, the ark - pieces of a puzzle that threaten to awaken an ancient and unknowable evil. I stand on the precipice of an abyss, caught in a plot spun by powers beyond my comprehension. A low moan escapes my lips, a plea for mercy to whatever gods may be listening. But in the deep caverns beneath Ironrock, under the watchful, slumbering gaze of Maraan, my plea echoes back, unanswered.\n\nZephyrion's thin lips curve into a smile that's colder than any crypt in these mines.\n\n\"You see, Snib, your pet’s collar isn’t just a tool of obedience,\" he begins, his voice echoing off the stone. His words wrap around me like a vice, squeezing tighter and tighter as he speaks. \"It acts as a conduit, a binding link between the physical and the ethereal. And with the right... spark, we can awaken the dormant power within this sanctuary.\"\n\nMy heart leaps into my throat. The linked arcanameter glows brighter with my emotions, and I feel a jolt as though it’s drawing something from within me. A sick feeling rises in the pit of my stomach, and I turn to look at Elara, her eyes wide and horrified.\n\nZephyrion waves his hand, and the space around the statue begins to shudder and distort. \"We just need to ignite that spark,\" he says, his eyes glinting.

But it tightens, pulling me off balance, as Zephyrion waves his hand again, conjuring additional tendrils of magical energy that coil around my wrists and ankles, holding me in place.\n\nElara’s own shrieks cut through the noise as two guards grab her. She struggles against their grip, her terrified eyes locked onto mine. Zephyrion watches the scene unfold, an impassive smile on his face.\n\n\"You didn’t really think we’d brought her here for your comfort, did you?\" He chuckles, a cold, lifeless sound that ricochets off the stone walls. \"She is a key to awakening Maraan.\"\n\nThe words slam into me like a hammer. They’re going to kill her. Sacrifice her to this... this thing. I strain against the tethers, but they’re too strong.\n\nZephyrion continues, oblivious to my struggle, \"See, a pre-existing connection is required. A bond between the collar's wearer and the sacrifice.\" He points towards the altar, where ominous hieroglyphs are etched into the stone. \"The ancient text speaks of blood given willingly, but I’ve found that fear and desperation can be...persuasive substitutes. Your little goblin offspring would have made suitable vessels. Pity they aren't around anymore.\"\n\nHis words are a thunderclap, echoing in the silence that follows. I thrash against the tethers, my mind reeling. I want to scream, to fight, to do something. But all I can do is watch in helpless horror as Zephyrion begins his ritual, the chanting growing louder, the arcanameter's glow intensifying.\n\nThe fear in Elara’s eyes burns into me, her voice a terrified whimper as she’s dragged towards the altar. Zephyrion’s cruel laughter echoes around me, and I know with gut-wrenching certainty that I’m powerless to stop what’s coming.\n\nThe statue of Maraan pulses, as if sensing the fear and chaos. Its multitude of obsidian eyes seem to follow Elara, the monstrous tentacles quivering with anticipation. I can almost feel its hunger, a ravenous beast waking from a long slumber.

The reality of the situation sets in - Elara, the woman I love, is about to be sacrificed to an ancient god. All to serve the twisted machinations of a power-crazed wizard.\n\nZephyrion squints at the brass tripod contraption, his stormy grey eyes reflecting the sickly glow of the arcanameter. His lips twist in a grimace of dissatisfaction. \"It's not enough power,\" he says, his voice echoing ominously in the chamber. “The meter needs to be full.”\n\nMy heart beats a frantic rhythm against my ribs. I feel a rush of terror at his words, a sense of foreboding crawling up my spine.\n\n\"You,\" he points at Snib, his expression one of distaste. \"Your connection with her is the key. You need to... increase the bond. You know what to do.\" The implication of his words lands like a punch in the gut. “Fuck her.”\n\nMy blood runs cold. \"No,\" I say, my voice coming out as a strangled gasp. \"You can't...\" But my words trail off as a new tether of light wraps around my ankles, hoisting me into the air.\n\nAn icy sensation slithers up my legs, holding me in an uncomfortable spread-eagle position. I squirm, feeling the magic tethers around my feet digging into my flesh. I cry out, as the edges of my leather armor peel back with a soft, humiliating sound, exposing my still recovering, wet pussy to the chilly air.\n\nSnib's disgusting laughter bounces off the stone walls, echoing in my ears as he approaches me. My body is displayed, the firm globes of my ass jiggling as the magical bindings adjust me into an obscene pose.\n\n\"Please!\" I scream, but my plea is swallowed by the heavy, oppressive silence of the temple. I struggle against the bindings, the rough stone floor cold beneath my trembling hands.\n\nMy eyes dart to Elara, her beautiful face contorted with fear. She's dragged forward by the royal soldiers, her beautiful body forced onto the altar. The cold stone looks harsh and unforgiving against her soft skin. Her eyes meet mine, and the terror in them mirrors my own.\n\nMy pulse pounds in my ears. Every instinct screams at me to protect her, to fight. But I can't. I'm trapped in this horrifying display, an unwilling participant in Zephyrion's twisted ritual.\n\n\"I won't let you do this,\" I manage to choke out. I turn to Zephyrion, my gaze pleading. \"Take me instead. Don't hurt her.\"\n\nZephyrion's laugh is cold, devoid of any semblance of empathy. \"Oh, your sacrifice is of a different nature,\" he says, his voice dripping with condescension. He motions to Snib, standing behind me with his sickly green skin glistening in the eerie light.\n\nMy fat, jiggling ass, exposed and helpless, is presented to the goblin, as if on a silver platter, perfectly at his height, perfectly easy to access. Heat radiates off his musky, greasy schlong as he drapes it over the curvature of my ass. The weight and girth of the shaft fills me with terror, yet I can't help but be awfully aware of its veiny texture. I can't believe it's come to this - to be taken so brutally in this ancient K’Tarran sanctum, in front of an audience of Zephyrion's men and Elara.\n\nA harsh slap echoes in the cavernous space, and I feel the impact a moment later - Snib spanks my ass. My cheeks jiggle from the force, the sound reverberating off the cold stone walls, followed by an obscene squelch as his schlong sways and bounces against my tender skin.\n\nMy heart thumps loudly in my chest, every thud echoing my dread as Snib grunts, \"Oi, cow tits, yer about to get a taste of ol' Snib again.\"[Choice: Get fucked.",

He grinds against me, the obscene swell of him spreading me open, his cockhead glossy with slick precum. My body involuntarily clenches around the intrusion, the hot tightness in my gut a stark contrast to the chilled air caressing my exposed skin.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" Snib snarls, rubbing his throbbing length between my ass cheeks. \"Cuz you killed my pups, I'm gonna pump ya full again, in front of all these pricks.\"\n\nI shiver as his filthy words wash over me, the fear knotting in my stomach. His comment about his pups brings back a fresh wave of despair, the cruel reminder of my countless humiliations. His brutal fucking, his seed inside me, the births - I can't help but sob at the memories.\n\nTo my left, Zephyrion is a silhouette against the flickering torchlight, his stormy grey eyes shining with anticipation. His grin is as cold as the stone around us - a chilling promise of the horrors to come.\n\nAnd there, lying on the altar, is Elara. My wife. My world. I can't bear to think of her impending sacrifice, can't stomach the thought of her being part of this twisted ritual. Her sapphire eyes meet mine.\n\nThe painful stretch of Snib's schlong invading me yanks me back to the dreadful present. The sensation of him forcing his way into me, his thick member coated in slimy precum, sends a jolt through my body. My insides quiver, convulsing around his girth. The way my body responds to his touch, the wet warmth enveloping him, is another harsh blow.\n\n\"Aye, yer taking it well, tit-bitch,\" he leers. \"Gonna be a good show.\"\n\nMy back arches, my jiggling tits dangling downward, and my breath catches in my throat.\n\n\"Ah, fuck, guess yer cunt wasn't ruined after all,\" Snib's grating voice cuts through the dread-filled silence, and I can't help but gasp as he starts moving, his fat, grotesque little body rhythmically slamming against myfat ass, each impact sending my flesh into a quaking, undulating dance.\n\nI hate it, I hate him, but the sensations are overwhelming.\n\nAnd I moan like a bitch.\n\nMy body betrays me, my tits bouncing in time with his thrusts, my nipples hardened, and the humiliation is crushing.\n\nSnib picks up his pace, and the sound of my asscheeks getting clapped echoes through the ancient K’Tarran sanctum. My cheeks burn with the utmost disgrace.\n\nMy wife is about to die, and I'm getting fucked by a goblin.\n\nYet, through the fog of dread and humiliation, the collar keeps me in check, its metallic cold biting into my skin, the magical tether pulsing with the rhythm of my heart as I'm suspended in the air.\n\nThe sickening squelches of our rutting is amplified in the cavernous chamber. I can't escape the undeniably lewd sensation of his smegma-slickened member, throbbing and pulsing, as he takes his pleasure from me.\n\nHeat stings my reddened cheeks. I feel the constant jiggle of my my hanging breasts trapped in their tight leather confines, bouncing gently in obscene rhythm to his punishing thrusts. Sweat trickles down the valley of my cleavage, every droplet making my heavy metal collar uncomfortably slick against my throat.\n\nThe magical tendrils suspending my body hold me in this perfectly vulnerable state, the cold air of the chamber teasing my exposed ass. Snib's grubby hands knead my round, firm ass-globes.\n\nHis cock stretches me out. Each thrust, each squelch, sends waves of perverse, unwanted pleasure radiating through my body. He grunts with each pump, his voice guttural and feral, like some beast of the wild, rutting without a care for my torment in front of all these people.\n\nMy gaze, heavy and clouded with tears, drifts to Elara. Her blue eyes are wide with fear, her body trembling on the sacrificial altar. My heart aches for her, the pain of our shared humiliation a burning knot in my chest.\n\nI can feel the relentless rhythm building, the monstrous goblin cock driving into me with unerring precision. Each powerful thrust lights another spark in the arcanameter, its power level rising with every stroke. And with each passing second, the reality of Elara's impending doom strikes home.\n\nMy senses are overwhelmed. The scent of Snib's musky arousal fills my nose, an unfortunately familiar, sickly-sweet smell that brings with it a wave of revulsion. His grunts echo in my ears, punctuating the haunting silence of the chamber with a chilling reminder of my helplessness. The raw taste of my tears fills my mouth.\n\nIt's the worst humiliation possible for someone to bear, a spectacle of my helplessness, and a testament to Snib's perverse triumph over me, even now, at the end.\n\nThrough it all, I can only grit my teeth and endure it as I’m suspended in the air, a sexual marionette.\n\nEvery balls-deep slam from Snib pushes me closer to the edge of a precipice I'm desperately trying to avoid.\n\nThe chamber echoes with the obscene CLAP, CLAP, CLAP sounds of flesh slapping against flesh, his monstrous cock ravaging my squirting pussy.[Choice: Snib is loving this.",

The humiliation is complete, and yet, there's a part of me that's drowning in the sheer sexual intensity.\n\n\"Ahh!

My vision blurs, the edges of my consciousness fraying as pleasure and pain meld into a single, overwhelming sensation. My legs tremble, the magical bindings sizzling as I buck wildly against my ethereal restraints.\n\nSnib's thrusts become erratic, more desperate. The goblin's balls slap against my tender skin, a wet, nasty noise that punctuates his savage rhythm.

The knowledge that the onlookers can hear my helpless juices squirting out, the way they pool on the cold stone floor beneath me in a shiny puddle. The rhythmic squelching of our rutting is deafening, echoing around the chamber like some obscene anthem. I can feel the pressure building, a tidal wave of sensation threatening to crash over me.

His words resonate with a power and authority that belies his eccentric appearance. His silver hair flows around him, his eyes flashing with a fiery intensity.\n\nThrough my blurred vision, my attention is torn from the goblin's pulsating presence inside me to the sudden influx of energy filling the room.\n\nZephyrion stands motionless for a moment, then slowly, arrogantly, turns his piercing stormy eyes towards Fendril.\n\n“This is not your place, Fendril,” the royal wizard says, his voice dripping with disdain.\n\nFendril’s eyes narrow behind his glasses, “I remember a time when you were a scholar in the Grand Hall. Eager to learn, eager to help. It breaks my heart, how far you've strayed.” He shakes his head, a mingling of pity and sorrow evident on his face.\n\nSuddenly, a sound breaks my focus: the shuffling of armored feet. From behind Fendril, my friends emerge, looking defiant and battle-ready. Garrett’s massive frame is intimidating, even compared to the royal guards. \"We won't let this continue,\" he growls, his words carrying a threat.\n\nRoderick, Duncan, Jonah, all standing in formation, faces set in grim determination.\n\n\"You've gone too far, Zephyrion!\" Roderick calls out, his voice echoing in the chamber.\n\nThen, the cavern trembles slightly as the royal soldiers, clad in polished armor, step forward, their weapons gleaming menacingly. They are well-trained, deadly, their discipline apparent in their tight formations and synchronized movements.\n\nZephyrion, with an air of indifference, casts a sideways glance at Snib, who’s still embedded within me. He motions the goblin to continue. “Continue, creature - this is only a minor inconvenience.”\n\nIt’s then that Fendril’s soft, yet stern voice slices the tension, “Has the sacrifice of Aldric not been enough for you? Would you also murder his wife, and allow this goblin to ravage his female body? I heard even of the goblin births. All for some ancient, uncontrollable evil?”\n\nZephyrion's lips curl into a sardonic smile, “Once Sirath falls, my methods will be of no concern. The woman is a necessary sacrifice. The goblin served his purpose. Justice will be served in due time.”\n\n\"It will be served TONIGHT,” Garrett says. “To you.”\n\nHe’s flanked by Captain Giles, who steps forward, his posture imposing. \"For Eboncrest and for our fallen friend, we stand against you.”[Choice: A battle is imminent.",

But even in this compromising position, my eyes are drawn to Master Fendril, Eboncrest’s lowly town wizard. He moves like water, the fluid dance of his hands weaving intricate patterns in the air, drawing from the wellspring of his power. His fingers glide, his wrist flicks, and spiraling glyphs of brilliant turquoise erupt, aiming to destroy the arcanameter.\n\nZephyrion is swift in his retaliation, an orchestra conductor of raw power. With a flourish, his fingertips summon cascading shields of amethyst, intercepting Fendril's blasts, turning them into harmless sparkles. But Fendril's desperation sharpens his resolve. His hands become a blur, fingers splaying then snapping together, tracing shapes unseen, invoking more arcane might.\n\nTheir dueling incantations fill the cavern, a dance of spell and counter-spell.\n\nWith every gesture, Fendril pulls threads of luminous gold from the very air - life magic. As he releases each desperate blast, his face ages subtly, wrinkles deepening, silver hair thinning. The very years of his life, traded for the momentary power to compete with the royal wizard, but it's not enough.\n\nZephyrion smirks, countering with fluid ease, his own patterns ethereal and complex. A sweeping gesture erects barriers of rippling obsidian, while a tight fist sends ricocheting blasts of dark energy back at Fendril. The space between them becomes a storm of swirling energies, light and dark battling for dominance.\n\nBeyond this magical duel, the clang of steel on steel fills the atmosphere. My friends, loyal to Aldric and now to me, hurl themselves against the royal guards. Their strikes are fueled by desperation and righteous anger.

      "text": "(:21,\"The Hunt\")The sharp bite of the wind is dulled by the heavy, fur-lined cloaks we wear, their warmth seeping right into our bones as our horses gallop tirelessly through the snow-dusted mountain pass. The sun is just beginning to crawl above the distant peaks of the Ironspike Mountains, blushing the crisp morning in hues of gold and rose. The soft glow lends an ethereal beauty to an otherwise harsh landscape.\n\nElara rides a horse-length away from me, her auburn hair streaming in the wind like wildfire. Her sapphire eyes are bright and focused, her leather-clad body moving in effortless sync with her horse's rhythm. The bow strapped across her back is a stark reminder of our chosen life – a life on the road, of swords and magic, of revenge and justice.\n\nWe're not husband and wife anymore, not really. We're much more and much less at the same time – we're warriors, each bound to the other. Connected by a shared destiny, a shared past, we now stand as two pillars - resilient, steadfast, and unbroken.\n\nAnd we still fuck, of course! It’s important, especially in the cold nights we’ve been spending, up in the Ironspikes.\n\nDrawing in a deep breath, I signal my horse to halt. The tracks we've been following are fresher here, the goblins’ haphazard footprints marring the otherwise pristine snow. \"Look here, Elara.\" I point to a crushed patch of snow just off the trail. “Fresh. They're close.”\n\nShe reins in her horse next to me and studies the indentations in the snow. There's a determined glint in her eyes as she looks up at me.\n\nThe scent of wet earth, pine and wildflowers fill my nostrils as our horses trot alongside a winding brook, heading further into the heart of the mountains. Elara is quick to comprehend the tracking nuances I share, her observant gaze scanning the surrounding woods for signs of goblin passage.\n\nWe rise a hill, and down in the distance, nestled between the broad shoulders of two mountains, is the city of Thuulk. Spires of shimmering opal and onyx, tall towers with colored glass, and a massive citadel perched on a hill, its gleaming metal domes imbued with the colors of dawn.\n\nWe've been tracking a group of goblins to the north, and perhaps this time, we'll finally catch Snib. And, if the Ephemerals are kind, we'll make him pay for what he’s done. We'll do it together, as Elara and Elise.\n\nUnderneath my heavy cloak, my tits jiggle with each trot, each gallop, serving as a constant reminder of the woman I am. And yet, I no longer feel the frustration I once did. I've embraced this body, accepting its weaknesses and strengths as my own, and using them to regain control over my destiny.\n\nElara, too, seems more at ease, more alive than ever before. Our journey has changed us, hardened us, stripped away the last vestiges of our old lives. But it has also brought us together, bound us in a shared quest that goes beyond mere vengeance - a quest for freedom, justice, and a second chance at life. A chance that had been very close to slipping away, just weeks ago.\n\nOur horses clatter down the mountain pass, their hooves kicking up clouds of frosty dust that shimmer in the soft rays of the sun. In the near distance, we spot the goblin camp, nestled in a tight valley, two crude tents poking out like boils against the pristine snow.\n\nThe remnants of a hastily abandoned fire smoulder in the snow, the smell of charred meat hang heavy in the cold mountain air.[Choice: Something's wrong.",

My horse rears, her ear-splitting neigh echoing across the snow-covered mountains.\n\nMy heart pounds, the familiar rush of adrenaline coursing through my veins as I draw Whisperwind. Beside me, I hear the soft whoosh of an arrow being released, and a goblin squeals as he drops to the ground, Elara's arrow lodged deep in his chest.\n\nShe maneuvers her horse with an unusual grace, an almost feral grin on her face. She is enjoying this, the thrill of the fight. Her bow sings again and another goblin falls.\n\n“Elara, keep your back to me!” I say, my voice cutting through the chaos. “Watch your flank!”[Choice: React!",

The sickening smell of viscera fills the air, but there's no time to think, only to react.\n\nThe goblins rush us, their razor-sharp claws slashing as they try to bring us down. Their cocks bob with each jump, ugly, fat things, and a wave of disgust washes over me. They think we’re easy prey, and I know for a fact, that they’re envisioning dragging us into their tents once they’ve subdued us.\n\nElara’s arrow finds its mark, taking down another. She has a natural knack for archery, it seems. She's still a little clumsy, her grip too tight, her pull a little strained, but her eyes... In her eyes, there is an undeniable determination. Almost… frightening.\n\nOne goblin sneaks behind her, lunging and pulling her from her horse. Her bow skitters off to the side. His schlong twitches excitedly as he looms over her.\n\nThen, Elara smiles - too wide.\n\nHer hand morphs into a writhing mass of tentacles. The goblin's squeals are cut short as her tendrils wrap around his tiny head, snapping it with a sickening crunch.\n\nI stop mid-swing, staring slack-jawed at Elara. She just shrugs.\n\n“Guess Maraan left me a little present,\" she shrugs.\n\nI laugh, despite the situation, despite the chilling sight of Elara's new abilities.\n\n“I’m just glad you're on my side,” I say.\n\n\"Always.\" she replies with a wicked smirk, as I skewer another goblin. \"And, I discovered a few nights ago… I can grow these tentacles anywhere if I try...\"\n\nMy cheeks flush at the implication, images of a very different kind of battle flashing in my mind.\n\nThe last goblin falls to the ground, its sickly green limbs twitching in the virgin snow.

Skulgaroth. A name whispered with dread among their kind.\n\n“I’ll never say nothin’! Skulgaroth, Skulgaroth!” He repeats the word like a talisman, a protective charm against death.\n\nElara tuts, a gleam in her sapphire eyes as she steps forward. \"I believe you,\" she murmurs quietly. With swift, brutal precision, she stomps her boot down on the creature's throat. Its eyes widen in shock, then dull as the life seeps out of it.\n\nI shudder involuntarily.

A glimmer of hope sparks in my heart, and I feel a small smirk tug at my lips.\n\n\"I think I know someone who could help us,\" I reply.

But, I figure we haven’t learned much, if we can’t learn laugh at the sick jokes the gods have played on both of us.\n\nAs the sun finally peeks over the horizon, we mount our horses, leaving the grisly scene behind.\n\nWhat lies ahead is uncertain, but we will face it together.\n\nThe End]View credits?",

      "text": "A Comprehensive Treatise on the Goblinoid Species\n\n**Dr. Ignatius Bramblethorne, M.A., D.Phil., F.R.S., Chair of Evolutionary Xenobiology, University of Thuulk**\n\n*Being a Complete Natural History of the Green Plague, their Customs, Physiognomy, and Terrible Decline*\n\n**Anatomical Description**\n\nThe common goblin stands between three and four feet in stature, though chieftains may reach five feet when well-fed from birth—a phenomenon my colleague Professor Blackwater terms \"nutritional caste determination.\" The skin ranges from pond-scum green to deep forest emerald, typically mottled with warts that weep a mild irritant when aroused. The skull is overlarge for the body, housing surprisingly complex neural matter that has, tragically, atrophied toward singular purpose over recent generations.\n\nMost striking to the observer is the grotesque sexual dimorphism. Males sport genitalia that would shame a donkey—nine to fourteen inches when engorged, thick as a maiden's wrist, purple-headed and perpetually weeping that damnable precum that has doomed so many human settlements. The testes hang like overripe melons, visibly churning with their cursed productivity. By contrast, the increasingly rare females possess almost human-like beauty in miniature: violet or amber eyes, curves that would charm any tavern, and most remarkably, functioning intellects undimmed by the reproductive madness that has consumed their males.\n\n**Goblin Society**\n\nHere I must reference the seminal work of Professor Angharad Fflur, whose *Dialects of the Dark Deeps* documents the goblin transformation from a culture of surprising sophistication to the current state of roving rape-gangs. Goblins once possessed art, literature (crude but extant), even rudimentary philosophy centered on their deity Storak and his emanations. Cave paintings in the Ironspike Mountains depict complex theological debates rendered in surprising detail.\n\nBut the species has fallen victim to its own evolutionary success. As Professor Fflur writes: \"The goblin male who could breed human females without consent gained advantage over he who courted goblin females. Thus began the spiral.\" Today, ninety-three births in one hundred produce males. The remaining females preserve what culture remains while watching their species commit slow suicide through genetic bottlenecking.\n\nModern goblins organize in three primary structures:\n\n**Roving Warbands** — Groups of fifteen to fifty males, usually kin-related, who raid human settlements. They follow seasonal patterns, moving between water sources in the Shifting Sands. Leadership belongs to whoever's cock has proven most prolific—typically measured by counting pregnant captives.\n\n**Warren-Fortresses** — Permanent structures like the infamous Fortress of Sorrow, where hundreds of goblins maintain breeding pens. Here, captured women are kept in states of perpetual pregnancy, their minds eroded by pheromone exposure until they beg for their next insemination. I witnessed such a place during the Crown's failed purge of '39—the sounds still wake me at night.\n\n**Gobborees** — Not much is known, but these are periodic festivals where multiple tribes converge to trade captives, compete for breeding rights, and engage in the *Grulkaz-Naks* (fertility ceremonies). The notorious Griznak Gobboree has become a slave market of such depravity that even hardened mercenaries refuse escort duty in the region.\n\n**Religious Decay**\n\nThe goblin pantheon, once complex, has collapsed into worship of Storak the Progenitor, whose theological teachings have been perverted into simple breeding imperatives:\n\n- **Grognar** (Might Makes Right) — Once a principle of justified leadership, now merely \"biggest cock rules\"\n- **Grulkaz** (Sanctity of Seed) — Transformed from reverence for life into compulsive spreading of genetic material\n- **Drulg** (Eternal Return) — The belief that dead goblins reincarnate through Storak's loins, justifying endless reproduction\n\nMy late colleague Sister Catherine of the Abbey of Flux made the mistake of attempting theological dialogue with goblin shamans. She returned three months later, belly swollen with twins, unable to speak of anything but her need for \"green blessing.\" The Abbey was dissolved shortly after.\n\n**Linguistic Corruption**\n\nThe goblin tongue, Goblish, itself provides heartbreaking evidence of their decline. Ancient texts (when translated) reveal complex poetry, philosophical arguments, even tender love songs between goblin pairs. Modern Goblish has lost two-thirds of its vocabulary, replaced by over two hundred terms for human female anatomy and the act of forced breeding. As Professor Fflur notes: \"They literally no longer possess words for concepts like 'consent' or 'courtship'—these have been replaced by variations on 'mounting' and 'seeding.'\"\n\n**Pheremones**\n\nIt bears repeating, as public safety demands: goblin reproductive chemistry represents an existential threat to human civilization. Their semen contains compounds that:\n- Can trigger immediate ovulation regardless of cycle\n- Dissolve existing pregnancies to make room for goblin offspring\n- Rewrite neural pathways to create breeding addiction\n- Alter vaginal pH to be hostile to human sperm, even long after contact\n- Trigger production of nutrients specifically suited to goblin offspring\n\nThe famous Thuulk Incident (detailed in another of my treatises) demonstrated that even academic observation of goblin mating carries risk. The very air during their rutting becomes saturated with pheromones. Three of my research assistants, despite wearing herb-soaked masks, still reported \"inappropriate moisture\" and \"womb-aching\" after merely watching a goblin masturbate through reinforced glass.\n\n**Genetic Catastrophe**\n\nHere lies the great irony scholars have identified: goblin evolutionary \"success\" will likely ensure the eventual doom of their species. By breeding exclusively with human females, they no longer combine genetic material naturally except in isolated instances. Each generation is essentially clone-spawn, accumulating mutations without the cleansing of sexual recombination. The massive genitalia, impossible seminal production, and pheromonal weapons that make them such effective breeders also render them increasingly unable to survive without human wombs.\n\nDr. Marcus Whitmore of the Royal College estimates complete genetic collapse within eight generations. Yet those eight generations could see human civilization overrun by billions of increasingly desperate, increasingly mutated goblin males seeking wombs to fill.\n\n**Case Study: The Traitor-Maiden of Westfall**\n\nLady Catherine Blackwood, daughter of Earl Blackwood, was taken during the Westfall Raids. Rescued six months later, she had to be physically restrained from returning to her captors. Her testimony, given under truth-spell compulsion:\n\n*\"You don't understand. The smell makes everything else meaningless. First dose on my tongue and my womb opened like a flower. Second dose and I forgot my own name. By the third day, I was begging them to breed me harder. My body CHANGED. My cervix learned to suck at their cocks. My womb started producing this sweet ache that only goblin seed could cure. When they rescued me, I tried to kill them. I would have done anything to get back to my masters. I still dream of the weight of their balls on my chin, the stretch of their cocks in my throat. If you hadn't chained me, I'd be crawling back right now, presenting my hole for breeding.\"*\n\nShe birthed triplets four months later. All male. All pure goblin despite her human womb.\n\n**A Species in a Terminal Frenzy**\n\nThe goblin species has achieved short-term evolutionary victory at the cost of its long term success. They have become nothing more than walking breeding apparatus, their culture dissolved in cum, their future written in the swollen bellies of human women. Each generation grows more grotesque: larger cocks, more copious ejaculate, stronger pheromones, weaker minds.\n\nThe rare female goblins represent the last echo of what they once were—clever, cultured, even capable of love. But they birth only males when bred by their own kind, and increasingly refuse to mate at all, watching in horror as their species devolves into rape-machinery.\n\nWe stand witness to a civilization fucking itself to death while dragging humanity down with it. The goblins will not survive another century. The question remains: will we?",

      "text": "Jarkrond\n\nJarkrond is an ash-runner—one of the desert horses that roam the Shifting Sands and choose their own masters. He stands sixteen hands at the withers, stocky where a warhorse would be sleek, his barrel chest wider than any Valarian courser's. His hide is the color of cold hearth-ash, rough-textured and mangy in patches, with a ridge of coarse hair running from poll to dock like the spine of some half-buried lizard. His hooves are broad and slightly splayed, padded underneath for floating across powder sand, and when he walks on stone they make a sound like knucklebones rattling in a cup.\n\nHis eyes are the color of fire-warmed amber, and they hold an intelligence that has nothing equine about it. Ash-runners are problem-solvers, place-rememberers, partner-choosers—they evaluate the creatures around them as potential allies or prey, and Jarkrond evaluates constantly. His ears, veined like bat-wings, swivel independently to track sound and dump heat into the desert air. His nostrils can slit nearly closed against sandstorms or flare wide to drink in scent from miles away.\n\nDesert horses do not accept bits. Do not tolerate spurs. Will go rigid as petrified wood if a rider attempts force, then explode into motion calculated to break bones. Ash-runners choose their partners through rituals of salt-sharing and whistle-signals that map onto their own social hierarchies, and Jarkrond chose Snib years ago—recognized something in the clever little predator that matched his own opportunistic nature. They raid together. Snib caches water and cuts thorny forage and stands watch at night. Jarkrond carries him to places where mares can be found, because ash-runner stallions are driven by a breeding imperative that borders on obsession.\n\nThe species runs heavily male—six colts born for every four fillies—and this scarcity has shaped them into roving seed-spreaders who will mount anything vaguely equine when the rut rises. Domestic mares, wild jennies, the mountain ponies of the Ironspike foothills. Their hybrids are common along the desert's edge: dune colts with their sires' heat-tolerance and their dams' tractability. Jarkrond has sired dozens, probably. His testicles hang heavy and prominent beneath his tail, visibly churning when a female scent reaches him, and his sheath—sweat-darkened, thick as a man's forearm—houses equipment proportionate to his breeding drive.\n\nJarkrond is not a warhorse. Not really a mount. Not a beast of burden in any sense a Valarian would recognize.\n\nHis amber eyes watch Elise when she isn't looking. His nostrils flare when she passes. His ears track her breathing in the dark.\n\nJarkrond is patient. Ash-runners can wait years for the right opportunity.",

      "label": "Sandwalkers",
      "text": "The Bone-Readers of the Shifting Wastes\n**From the journals of Ser Marcus Thorne, Knight-Cartographer of the Crown**\n\nCall them Sandwalkers if you must—the Valarian name for a people who name themselves nothing at all. They say a man who speaks his tribe's true name gives enemies power over his blood. So they are the *Kheth-ai-Marrow* in their own tongue—\"Those Who Read the Bones\"—and they will cut your throat for using even that much without permission.\n\nThey are human. That must be stated clearly, for the Crown's propaganda paints them as something else. But they have walked the Shifting Sands and the surrounding marshlands for so many generations that the land has... *changed* them in their souls as well as bodies.\n\nNo census has survived the attempt to count them. They move in tribal bands of ten to fifty, following water-patterns the rest of us cannot perceive. The desert tribes (*Kheth-Suul*) and the marsh tribes (*Kheth-Muur*) share blood but not territory, meeting only at the great Bone-Moots held when the red star rises—every seven years by Valarian counting.\n\n**Everything begins and ends with bone.**\n\nA Sandwalker child is born onto a mat woven from the finger-bones of ancestors. At the age of eight, they consume the rendered marrow of their great-grandmother. At fourteen, they kill their first worthy enemy and crack that enemy's skull to read the future written in the sutures.\n\nThis is not metaphor. I have *witnessed* the Bone-Seers work. They spread the fragments on stretched hide, apply oils that make the calcium fluoresce in moonlight, and read patterns that are—Ephemerals help me—*accurate*.\n\nThe magic—for it *is* magic, whatever the University's dithering academics claim—appears to derive from belief in the *Kharaketh*, the Bone-Mother, whom they worship as the only god worth fearing. She speaks through calcium and kerite. Every Sandwalker carries a pouch of ancestor-fragments, and consulting them before any significant decision is as automatic as breathing.\n\nThe Sandwalkers organize around three principles:\n\n**Blood** (*Suuk*): Your maternal lineage determines your tribe. Men marry outward; women stay. A man's children belong to his wife's people, not his own. This creates webs of obligation spanning the entire Sandwalker nation—your nephew might be your enemy's son, your cousin might lead the tribe that burned your father's camp.\n\n**Bone-Debt** (*Kharath*): When one tribe wrongs another, the aggrieved party may claim *Kharath*—the right to name a price in blood, gold, or flesh. This debt is *sacred*. A Sandwalker who refuses valid Kharath becomes *Suuk-eth*—bloodless, tribeless, fair game for any blade. I have seen a chieftain surrender his only daughter to satisfy Kharath for two stolen goats. The system seems mad until you realize: it *prevents* wars.\n\n**Word-Bond** (*Veth*): A Sandwalker's sworn word binds tighter than Valarian contracts. They do not understand our concept of \"diplomatic flexibility.\" If a Sandwalker says he will kill you at sunrise, he *will* kill you at sunrise unless you kill him first. If he says he will spare you in exchange for tribute, you *will* be spared.They cannot conceive of breaking Veth. They also cannot conceive of mercy once Veth is spoken.\n\nHere I must speak frankly of customs that offend Valarian sensibilities.\n\nWhen tribes conflict without clear Kharath—boundary disputes, insults of insufficient weight, trade disagreements—they may instead exchange *Muratheen*: \"peace-wombs.\" Each tribe sends one woman of breeding age to the other for a period of seven seasons. These women bear children for their host tribe, cementing alliance through blood.\n\nThe Muratheen are not slaves. They hold honored positions, may refuse individual men (though not the role itself), and return home with gifts and status. Their children are raised by the host tribe but know their mother's people as \"second-blood.\" The practice has created such tangled kinship that most Sandwalker tribes cannot war without killing cousins.\n\nI asked a chieftain's daughter—a Muratheen herself—if she resented her fate. She looked at me as if I had asked whether she resented breathing.\n\nLess savory is the *Greth-Muraat*: the Flesh-Tithe demanded from outsider settlements that encroach on Sandwalker territory.\n\nWhen Valarian farmers or miners establish themselves too close to tribal lands, the local chieftain rides to negotiate. If the settlers refuse to leave, they may instead pay Greth-Muraat: one woman per season, surrendered to the tribe for breeding. The children remain with the tribe. The woman may return after bearing, or may stay if she wishes.\n\nI am told—though I did not witness—that the Sandwalkers possess herbs and techniques that make the bearing... not unpleasant. That women who have paid Greth-Muraat sometimes return voluntarily. That the frontier towns closest to tribal lands have abnormally high rates of \"missing\" women who reappear years later, tan-skinned children in tow, speaking of husbands they cannot name.\n\nThe Crown officially condemns this practice. The Crown also officially ignores the dozen settlements that have paid Greth-Muraat for three generations rather than face tribal war.\n\n**Daily Life**\n\nThe desert tribes follow the *Suul-keth*—the sand-road, a network of underground water sources known only to Bone-Seers. They live in hide tents that can be struck in minutes, traveling by night when the heat relents. Their wealth is measured in *karath-beasts*: the great armored lizards they ride, each worth a dozen horses. Men hunt. Women weave, brew, and read bones. Children learn to kill before they learn to count.\n\nThe marsh build no permanent structures, instead living on floating platforms of woven reed and bone that drift through the Fever Marshes' channels. They harvest the *muraat-lotus*, a flower whose pollen induces prophetic dreams—and, in sufficient quantity, permanent madness. Their Bone-Seers are said to be the most powerful.\n\nBoth branches practice the *Keth-Suuul*: the Silence Hunt. Once per season, the entire tribe goes without speech for seven days while hunting a great beast—sand-wyrm, marsh-drake, or the terrible bone-cats that stalk the waste's edges. The hunt teaches that words are *precious*, not to be wasted. A Sandwalker who speaks unnecessarily is considered foolish; one who lies is considered dead.\n\n**Relations with Goblins**\n\nThe Sandwalkers despise goblin culture—or rather, despise its *absence*. A people who break Veth without thought, who take without Kharath, who breed without Muratheen-bonds, are barely people at all in Sandwalker eyes.\n\nYet they trade.\n\nGoblin camps near tribal territory sometimes pay tribute in metals, raw materials, and—reportedly—captured Valarian women the Sandwalkers might find useful for Greth-Muraat obligations. In return, the tribes refrain from exterminating the green pests.\n\nMore rarely, individual goblins earn *Suuk-keth*—blood-tolerance—by performing some service for a tribe. These goblins may camp near tribal lands unmolested, trade freely, even claim Veth-protection from other goblins. The arrangement is pragmatic. Sandwalkers are few; goblins breed like locusts. Better to have some green-skins bound by Sandwalker law than to fight them all.\n\nA goblin who breaks Veth with a Sandwalker tribe, however, brings down retribution on his entire camp. The tribes do not distinguish between \"guilty goblin\" and \"goblin.\"\n\n**My story**\n\nI spent three seasons among the *Kheth-Suul* of the Red Waste. I watched a chieftain's son die of fever and saw his mother crack his skull with her own hands to read his final prophecy. I saw a Muratheen-woman choose to remain with her host tribe, kissing her birth-mother goodbye without tears because the bones had foretold exactly this.\n\nI saw a people who have decided what they believe and live it completely.\n\nWe could learn from them, if we were not too frightened to try.",

      "text": "Skrall\n\n**Name:** Skrall\n**Classification:** Subterranean humanoid\n**Typical Habitat:** Old dungeons, underground lairs, abandoned ruins\n\n**Physical Description:**\nSkralls are hunched, wiry creatures with rugged, dark skin that camouflages well in their dark, rocky habitats. They possess sharp, angular features, with glowing red or yellow eyes that pierce through the darkness of their underground worlds. Their bodies are nimble and adapted for climbing and crawling through narrow, rocky passages.\n\n**Description:**\nSkralls are remnants of a once-intelligent and sophisticated race that has now devolved into primitive societies. Historical accounts suggest that the Skralls were initially a thriving civilization alongside the K'Tarran (some even theorize that they ARE the K'Tarran), who had deep knowledge of the earth sciences and arcane arts. They built vast underground cities and temples, some of which still stand as haunted ruins scattered across the landscapes of Zaelasia.\n\nA cataclysmic event, which old texts attribute to \"a darkness that swallowed their knowledge,\" led to the rapid decline of their society. This darkness is often speculated to have been a combination of a devastating natural disaster and an internal collapse possibly accelerated by overreliance on dark magic practices. In the millennia that followed, the Skralls lost their civilization's sophisticated nature and regressed into scattered tribes inhabiting the ruins of their ancestors.\n\n**Societal Structure:**\nModern Skrall societies are tribal and operate under a rudimentary hierarchy where strength and cunning are the primary means of rising in status. Each tribe is led by a Skrall King, who is not only the strongest but often the most cunning individual within the group. The King's rule is challenged frequently, leading to a volatile and ever-shifting leadership dynamic.\n\nSkralls are fiercely territorial and organize themselves around the strategic points of their underground habitats, which are often old dungeons or ruins that provide protection and resources. These locations are chosen for their defensibility and proximity to surface areas where they can raid for food and captives.\n\n**Behavior and Culture:**\nDespite their regression into a more primitive state, Skralls retain vestigial elements of their ancestors' intelligence. They are capable of setting traps, ambushing unwary travelers, and even performing basic rituals that echo the grander magical practices of their forebears. Their societies, while brutal and simplistic, follow a strict code that revolves around survival and the acquisition of power.\n\nLanguage among Skralls is a guttural and simplistic version of the ancient K'Tarran tongue, now devolved into a series of clicks and hisses that they use to communicate in the echoing chambers of their underground realms.\n\n**Interaction with Other Races:**\nSkralls are generally hostile towards all surface dwellers, viewing them as intruders or potential slaves. They are known to capture unwary travelers or raid surface villages, particularly during the dark of night. Their interactions are seldom peaceful and are characterized by aggression and stealth.\n\n**Mythology and Lore:**\nSkrall mythology, while fragmented, speaks of a golden age when their ancestors moved mountains and commanded the very forces of nature. They tell tales of the great darkness that stole their light and led them to live in the shadows of the world. These stories are often told by the Skrall Shamans, who serve as both spiritual leaders and lore-keepers in their crude societies.\n\n**Current Observations:**\nSkrall sightings are becoming increasingly common, hinting at either a population resurgence or a forced migration from deeper in the earth. Their appearance often portends increased hostility in the regions they inhabit, leading local villages to fortify defenses and send scouts into abandoned ruins to monitor Skrall movements.",

      "text": "Aethel-thuvari (The Telenil Language)\n\n**Dr. Cordelia Ravenshollow, Xenolinguistic Studies, University of Thuulk**\n\n*From \"Songs Written in Air: A Primer on Forest Tongues\"*\n\n---\n\nAethel-thuvari operates on tonal intervals rather than fixed meanings. Each two-syllable root carries base semantic weight, but the relationship between the pitches determines function. A rising-falling interval makes verbs, level-level makes nouns, falling-rising creates questions.\n\n**Core Structure**\n\nBuilt from CV (consonant-vowel) pairs exclusively. No consonant clusters exist. The five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) combine with twelve consonants (h, k, l, m, n, r, s, t, v, w, y, ʻ). The glottal stop (ʻ) functions as a \"breath reset,\" allowing speakers to chain concepts without breaking tonal flow.\n\nExample: *thuva* (tree/to grow) becomes:\n- thúvà (falling tones): \"ancient tree\"\n- thùvá (rising tones): \"to grow toward light\"\n- thūvā (level tones): \"the concept of tree-ness\"\n\n**Temporal Breathing**\n\nTime lives in vowel length. Present stretches one beat (*kala* - \"now-beauty\"), past holds two (*kaala* - \"remembered beauty\"), future breathes three (*kaaala* - \"beauty approaching\"). Children learn by humming—grammar is melody internalized before words.\n\n**The Whisper Particles**\n\nSentence-final particles, voiced so softly humans often miss them, alter entire meanings:\n- *-wei*: observed truth\n- *-sae*: inherited knowledge\n- *-oro*: dreamed/envisioned\n- *-thi*: temporary state\n\n\"Meliʻana thuva-wei\" = \"The light dances through trees (I see it)\"\n\"Meliʻana thuva-sae\" = \"The light dances through trees (as it always has)\"\n\n**Sacred Incompletions**\n\nThe Telenil never grammatically complete statements about death, love, or magic. These concepts require the listener to \"finish the harmony\" mentally. A declaration of love literally cannot be spoken alone—it requires another voice to complete the tonal chord, making true love linguistically impossible to declare falsely.\n\n**Root Examples**\n\n- *melu* (flow/water/change)\n- *ʻana* (breath/soul/between)\n- *koru* (bind/root/promise)\n- *wiye* (dream/mist/possibility)\n- *thara* (edge/blade/decision)\n\n**The Untranslatable**\n\n*Saeluʻoro*: The grief-joy of watching something beautiful die naturally (autumn leaves, elderly parents, sunset). No human tongue captures this sweet ache the Telenil consider fundamental to existence.\n\n*Meliweithuva*: The way light through forest canopy creates moving patterns that are never repeated. By extension, any unrepeatable beautiful moment.\n\n**Writing**\n\nAethel-thuvar uses no alphabet. Instead, they carve curved lines whose thickness indicates tone, creating patterns that look like flowing water. Reading requires tracing with one's finger while humming—the text literally teaches its own pronunciation.\n\n**Cultural Integration**\n\nTelenil children learn language through forest-walking. Each tree species \"sings\" differently in wind, teaching tonal patterns. A Telenil separated from forests gradually loses linguistic precision—their words literally wilt without natural harmony to reference.\n\nCommon greeting: *\"Mela'ana thuva-wei\"* (\"Your breath makes the trees real\")\nCommon farewell: *\"Koru'wiye sae\"* (\"Our roots dream together\")\n\n**Addendum: The Lament for the Transformed Hero**\n\nHear it.Telenil laments (*thuvaʻoro*) are sung only for the living who have undergone irreversible change—never for the dead, who are considered \"complete.\" This anonymous composition demonstrates the characteristic mixing of Aethel-thuvari with Common tongue that occurs when expressing concepts too painful for pure Telenil.\n\n**Line Analysis:**\n\n\"*Aldric meliʻana thuva-sae*\" - Uses past-continuous (*-sae*), suggesting Aldric's essence eternally exists in forest-memory, unchanged despite physical transformation.\n\n\"*Elise koru'wiye...*\" - A devastating sacred incompletion. The singer cannot grammatically complete a statement about Elise's nature, suggesting her existence is itself unfinished, impossible.\n\n\"*Thaara-soul*\" - Code-switches to Common for \"soul\" because Telenil *ʻana* (breath-soul) implies agency, which Elise has lost.\n\n\"*Meliweithuva in flesh-cage*\" - The untranslatable concept of unrepeatable beauty applied to imprisonment in her female body.\n\n\"*Hero-ʻana trapped*\" - Mixes Common \"hero\" with Telenil \"breath,\" suggesting the warrior's essence suffocates in the new form.\n\n\"*Saeluʻoro*\" - The grief-joy word applied to watching Aldric's strength \"die beautifully\" into Elise's submission. The singer finds aesthetic tragedy in the transformation.\n\n\"*Aldric thuúvaá*\" - Rising tones insist Aldric still grows toward light, even as—\n\n\"*Elise melù*\" - Falling tones show Elise flowing downward like water seeking its level.\n\nThe final incompletion on \"*koru...*\" (bind/promise/root) cannot be finished, suggesting the fundamental impossibility of reconciling these two identities. In Telenil philosophy, such incompletions are considered wounds in reality itself.",

      "text": "On the Reproductive Supremacy of Goblinoids: A Treatise\n\n**Dr. Ignatius Bramblethorne, M.A., D.Phil., F.R.S., Chair of Evolutionary Xenobiology, University of Thuulk**\n\nThe learned reader may dismiss as tavern fabrication the accounts of goblin males achieving thirteen—nay, fifteen—climactic emissions in a single rutting session. I assure you, dear colleague, such dismissal would be gravely mistaken. What follows is the fruit of two decades' study, purchased with the virtue of three research assistants (may the Ephemerals grant them peace) and my own haunted nights.\n\nThe goblinoid male harbors within his diminutive frame a reproductive apparatus that would humble a prize bull. Beyond the primary testicular sacs—which hang like overripe plums, perpetually swollen with their vile cargo—lie the *glandulae seminalis auxiliares*, a series of walnut-sized chambers nestled against the spine like parasitic tumors. These auxiliary reservoirs churn without cease, brewing a substance so thick with life-force that a single tablespoon, properly deployed, has been observed to impregnate an entire convent of Sisters of Flux (the Westmarch Incident, which the Crown has ordered us never to speak of).\n\nThe ejaculate itself defies comparison to human seed, which flows like thin gruel in contrast. Goblin emission emerges in *ropes*—and I use this term with disturbing literalness—of custard-thick matter, warm as fever-flesh and possessed of its own writhing motility. Under lens examination, one observes not the tadpole-like swimmers of human issue, but aggressive, hook-headed things that burrow and claw their way toward their target with disturbing purpose. The consistency varies throughout climax: the initial spurts arrive hot and thick as porridge left too long on the fire, while subsequent emissions grow ever more viscous until the final releases emerge in chewy, pearl-like clots that must be *chewed* by the receiving cavity to break down.\n\nBut it is the pheromonal payload that transforms these creatures from crude breeders into reproductive tyrants. Each goblin orgasm releases concentrated doses of what my late colleague Professor Gertrude Blackthorne termed \"submission smoke\"—an invisible miasma that bypasses conscious thought entirely. The exposed female (and I have witnessed this horror firsthand during the Laboratory Breach of '44) experiences immediate cervical dilation, spontaneous ovulation regardless of cycle, and most disturbingly, a complete reversal of disgust response. What should repulse instead attracts. What should sicken instead intoxicates. The thickness that should choke instead... nourishes.\n\nThe mechanism appears tied to ancient breeding contracts written into the very flesh of our species. Human women, goblin scholarship suggests (for yes, they have their own crude historians), were \"designed\" by forgotten powers to serve as superior breeding vessels when goblin females grew scarce. The human womb, once penetrated by goblin seed, begins producing hormones that *crave* repeated insemination. I have examined victims—forgive me, *subjects*—who, three months after a single exposure, still wake screaming for \"more of master's cream.\" The addiction is not psychological but written into the very tissues.\n\nMost disturbing is what I term the \"displacement phenomenon.\" Goblin semen, upon entering a gravid womb bearing non-goblin offspring, induces immediate spontaneous termination. The mechanism is ruthlessly efficient: the goblin seed literally *digests* the existing pregnancy, converting it to nutrient soup that then feeds the newly-implanted goblin spawn. One of my research subjects, a merchant's wife who had been three months with her husband's child when taken by raiders, delivered twins—both pure goblin—after only four additional months. The mathematics should not be possible, yet the evidence was undeniable.\n\n**The Matter of Auxiliary Reserves**\n\nRecent events force me to append this treatise with information I had hoped to take to my grave. The goblin male's capacity for sexual conquest extends beyond even what common knowledge suggests. Deep within the goblin pelvis lies what crude dissection reveals as the *reservatum ultimum*—a leather-tough sac capable of storing months of accumulated seed. When sufficiently aroused (typically through domination of a particularly desirable female), this reserve can discharge in what can only be described as a reproductive catastrophe.\n\nI refer, with great reluctance, to the case of the hero-turned-female known as Elise, whose debasement has become something of scholarly legend. During what witnesses describe as \"routine\" anal violation, the goblin achieved such arousal that his auxiliary reserve discharged with force sufficient to traverse her entire digestive tract. The volume—nearly a full quart by some estimates—erupted with such pressure that it filled her bowels, flooded her stomach, and fountained from her mouth and nostrils. That she survived is miraculous.\n\n]The expelled substance in such events is not the relatively \"fresh\" seed of regular emissions but a fermented, concentrated essence that has been aging like wine in the goblin's interior. Witnesses describe it as \"custard thick but somehow also chunky,\" with a reek that combines cheese-rind, battlefield latrines, and something uniquely musky that makes human females involuntarily ovulate from scent alone. The temperature of such emissions has been measured at nearly that of boiling water, though the receiving female's altered state prevents tissue damage that should by rights occur.\n\n**A Warning to the Learned**\n\nLet none dismiss these creatures as mere pests. A single goblin, properly positioned, could convert an entire nunnery within a moon's turning. Their seed does not merely impregnate—it *colonizes*, rewriting the female body's very purpose until she becomes naught but a goblin-producing vessel, craving nothing but the next injection of that thick, writhing cream. The afflicted describe the need as \"bones aching for marrow\"—a hollowness that only goblin emission can fill.\n\nI have seen proud sorceresses reduced to mewling addicts, begging for \"just one more rope of master's gift.\" I have documented cases where human women, rescued after months of captivity, escaped their saviors to return to goblin warrens, their wombs so altered they could no longer process human food, surviving only on regular deposits of goblin seed. The substance apparently contains all necessary nutrients when the female body has been properly \"prepared\" through repeated exposure.\n\nThe realm faces not merely raiders but a reproductive apocalypse that advances one womb at a time. Each woman taken is not just enslaved but transformed into a factory for producing more of these virile monsters. And most terrifying of all: the goblins know exactly what they possess between their legs. They understand their cocks are weapons more devastating than any sword.",

      "text": "Goblish\n\n**Professor Angharad Fflur, M.A., M.Litt., Ph.D., F.S.A., Chair of Goblinoid Studies, University of Thuulk**\n\n*From \"Comparative Xenolinguistics Quarterly,\" Vol. XXIII, 1242*\n\n**Prefatory Warning**\n\nWhat follows is a clinical examination of the most degraded language currently spoken in Zaelasia. I document this filth purely for academic completeness. That the Common tongue has absorbed certain Goblish obscenities—\"thrack\" being the most notorious—makes this work regrettably necessary.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nModern Goblish represents the most catastrophic linguistic devolution ever documented. Where Old Goblin texts reveal complex grammar with seventeen tenses and poetic formations rivaling the Telenil, contemporary Goblish has collapsed into roughly three hundred root words, over two-thirds relating to fornication or violence.\n\n**Phonology:**\n\nThe modern goblin throat produces primarily:\n- Glottal stops ('k, g'k, kr'k)\n- Wet fricatives (particularly when discussing breeding)\n- Pharyngeal grunts that accompany most sexual vocabulary\n\nThe language sounds, to quote my colleague Dr. Winters, \"like someone choking on phlegm while attempting to describe an orgy.\"\n\n**Grammar:**\n\nModern Goblish recognizes three tenses:\n1. Past: \"Grak thrack-uk\" (I fucked)\n2. Present: \"Grak thrack-ik\" (I fuck/am fucking)\n3. Future: \"Grak thrack-ok\" (I will fuck)\n\nThere is no subjunctive. No conditional. Goblins no longer linguistically conceive of hypotheticals.\n\n**Core Vocabulary:**\n\n*Sexual Terminology:*\n\nThe goblins possess forty-three words for ejaculation, each specifying volume, force, and target. Some are derived from old Goblish, whereas many are loanwords or recombinations from the common tongue:\n- **\"Splurtik\"**: To ejaculate weakly (considered insulting)\n- **\"Grok-splash\"**: To ejaculate with sufficient force to impregnate\n- **\"Thrack-gush\"**: To empty one's testicles completely in one coupling\n- **\"Skeet-uk\"**: To ejaculate on a face specifically\n- **\"Womb-thrack\"**: To ejaculate directly against the cervix\n- **\"Breed-belch\"**: The act of ejaculating so voluminously it refluxes from the womb\n\nFor the act of copulation itself:\n- **\"Thrack\"**: Basic fucking (has entered Common as profanity)\n- **\"Rut-thrack\"**: Violent breeding\n- **\"Seed-stuff\"**: To impregnate deliberately\n- **\"Cunt-wreck\"**: To fuck until the female is permanently altered\n- **\"Skull-thrack\"**: Forced oral penetration (lit. \"fuck-skull\")\n\nTesticular terminology shows disturbing specificity:\n- **\"Ball-sludge\"**: Accumulated semen after days without release\n- **\"Nut-drain\"**: The act of complete testicular emptying\n- **\"Seed-sacks\"**: Testicles (with seven variants based on fullness)\n- **\"Cum-brewing\"**: The sensation of testicles refilling\n- **\"Spunk-heavy\"**: The state of requiring immediate release\n\nFemale anatomy (exclusively for non-goblin females) reduces to:\n- **\"Breed-hole\"**: Vagina\n- **\"Cum-tank\"**: Womb\n- **\"Milk-sacks\"**: Breasts\n- **\"Face-cunt\"**: Mouth (when used sexually)\n\nThe verb \"to cum\" alone has twenty-eight conjugations based on volume:\n- **\"Skrit\"**: To produce drops\n- **\"Glorp\"**: To produce ropes\n- **\"Gush-thrack\"**: To produce cups worth\n- **\"Flood-nut\"**: To produce quarts (considered heroic)\n\n**Violence Terminology**\n\nSeventeen words for \"kill,\" differentiated by method. Twelve words for \"raid.\" No word for \"peace\" remains in the modern tongue.\n\n**Material Culture & Value Systems**\n\nFascinating linguistic stratification exists in how goblins categorize plunder:\n\n- **\"Shinies\"** (sh'NAI-eez): Non-magical valuables. Gold, gems, mundane treasures. Derived from the infantile Common \"shiny things\" but grammatically fossilized as a mass noun. \"Got many shinies from dead humies\" demonstrates typical usage.\n\n- **\"Sparklies\"** (SPARK-uh-leez): Magical artifacts of power. The distinction from \"shinies\" suggests goblins retain some primitive recognition of arcane energy. \"That sparkly got the booyagh\" indicates magical potency recognition.\n\n- **\"Booyagh\"** (BOO-yag): Perhaps the most linguistically complex remaining word. Originally \"bugh-yaaagh\" in Old Goblin, meaning \"star-fire\" or \"heaven's wrath,\" it denoted powerful magic. Modern usage has degraded into a general intensifier meaning anything from \"powerful\" to \"impressive\" to \"sexually appealing.\" Example: \"She got booyagh in her backside\" (she has an impressive posterior) versus \"That wand got mad booyagh\" (that wand contains significant magical power).\n\nThe semantic collapse of \"booyagh\" from divine magic to describing buttocks exemplifies Goblish devolution perfectly.\n\n**Neologistic Creativity**\n\nMost disturbing is Goblish's viral neologism generation. Goblins spontaneously create new word-combinations that other goblins immediately comprehend through some form of collective linguistic intuition. Field observations document:\n\n- **\"Tit-bounce-walk\"**: Created on-sight to describe a particular female's gait\n- **\"Cum-drunk-face\"**: Invented mid-raid, instantly adopted tribe-wide\n- **\"Hero-hole-maker\"**: Spontaneous term for the collar artifact, understood without explanation\n\nThis phenomenon suggests Goblish operates partially as a *cryptolect*—a secret language that evolves faster than outsiders can decode. Dr. Margrave theorizes this rapid mutual intelligibility stems from pheromonal markers that accompany new terms, encoding meaning directly into the listener's linguistic cortex.\n\n**Lost Concepts**\n\nModern Goblish entirely lacks words for:\n- Love (beyond breeding urge)\n- Art (except crude fertility symbols)\n- Future planning (beyond next raid/rut)\n- Consent (the closest is \"not-fighting-anymore\")\n- Family (beyond \"spawn\" and \"breeder\")\n- Any form of magic more complex than \"booyagh\" (despite historical evidence of goblin mages)\n\n**Grammatical Horrors**\n\nPossession is expressed solely through sexual dominance markers:\n- \"My woman\" = \"Cunt-I-filled\" (Single word: \"Thrackta\")\n- \"My child\" = \"Spawn-I-spurted\" (\"Splurtling\")\n- \"My territory\" = \"Where-I-spray\" (\"Skeet-ground\")\n- \"My treasure\" = \"Shinies-I-grabbed\" (\"Grab-shine\")\n- \"My artifact\" = \"Sparkly-mine-now\" (\"Mine-spark\")\n\nCounting relates exclusively to breeding or plunder:\n- Numbers exist only to six (typical litter size)\n- \"Seven\" translates as \"many-cunts-worth\"\n- \"Ten\" becomes \"two-hands-shinies\"\n- Higher numbers expressed as \"all-the-sparklies\" or \"booyagh-many\"\n- Time measured in \"ruts\" (approximately three hours)\n\n**Cultural Contamination**\n\nDisturbingly, Goblish corrupts other languages through contact. Common-speaking soldiers returning from goblin conflicts introduce:\n- \"Thrack\" (now widespread vulgarity)\n- \"Nut\" (as verb, gaining currency in lower quarters)\n- \"Breed-crazy\" (entering medical terminology for goblin pheromone exposure)\n- \"Booyagh\" (adopted by Thuulk street gangs to mean \"excellent\")\n- \"Shinies\" (used by children universally for treasures)\n\nThe Washerwomen's District in Thuulk has developed a pidgin incorporating:\n- Goblish sexual imperatives\n- Common grammatical structures\n- Resulting in phrases like \"gonna thrack-wise get bred-up\"\n- \"Got mad booyagh after finding them sparklies\"\n\n**Linguistic Weapons**\n\nGoblish pheromonal markers embed in certain phrases. Speaking \"glork-thrack-breeding-time\" repeatedly can trigger responsive dampness in exposed females. The goblin throat produces specific frequencies during \"breed-words\" that bypass cognitive resistance.\n\nThe word \"booyagh\" itself, when growled at the proper pharyngeal depth, can cause momentary disorientation in human females—a vestigial response to its magical origins.\n\nField Report: Three of my graduate students, after transcribing goblin mating-chants, required medical intervention for \"spontaneous ovulation.\" The language itself becomes a reproductive weapon.\n\n**Comparative Degradation**\n\nOld Goblin (circa 800): \"The moon-silver on water recalls my beloved's eyes\"\nMiddle Goblin (circa 1000): \"Female pretty, want coupling\"\nModern Goblish (1242): \"Cunt wet, thrack now, pump spawn\"\nContemporary Goblish (1246): \"Booyagh-tits need seed-stuffing for sparkly-shinies\"\n\nIn four centuries, we observe complete linguistic collapse from poetry to pure breeding imperative mixed with primitive commerce.\n\n**Adaptive Borrowing**\n\nGoblish cannibalizes other languages with disturbing efficiency:\n- Telenil \"aethir\" (soul) becomes \"aeth-hole\" (particularly tight orifice)\n- Dwarvish \"grundi\" (foundation stone) becomes \"grund-thrack\" (missionary position)\n- Common \"sparkle\" degraded to \"sparkly\" (magical item)\n- Common \"shine\" devolved to \"shiny\" (valuable object)\n\nThis linguistic vampirism suggests goblins retain some deep structural capacity for language acquisition, perverted entirely toward breeding and plunder terminology.\n\n**A Language's Death Rattle:**\n\nModern Goblish is not truly language but vocalized rape mixed with primitive commerce. Every utterance reinforces breeding, violence, or acquisition. Mothers cannot sing lullabies—the vocabulary doesn't exist. Fathers cannot tell stories beyond \"fucked many, killed many, got booyagh shinies.\"\n\nThe spontaneous neologisms suggest the language attempts to evolve but can only generate new ways to describe degradation. It's a tongue that exists purely to coordinate violation and celebrate plunder.\n\nThe language will die with its speakers, leaving only the vulgar loanwords in Common as testament to their existence. Perhaps this is mercy.\n\nI require strong wine after completing this documentation. My recommendation to the University: Goblish studies should be restricted to senior faculty with proven psychological fortitude. The language itself is a cognitive hazard.\n\n*Professor Angharad Fflur*\n*Department of Comparative Xenolinguistics*\n*University of Thuulk*\n\n**Post-Script:** My chambermaid, having glimpsed these notes, asked what \"thrack\" meant precisely. I told her it was untranslatable. She responded, \"Oh, you mean like when they booyagh your sparkly-place?\" I considered submitting my resignation on the spot.\n\n**Editorial Note:** Three terms in this document have been magically redacted by University censors to prevent inadvertent pheromonal triggering in readers. The growing adoption of terms like \"booyagh\" in common parlance suggests our linguistic barriers are failing.",

      "text": "Melka's Lament\n\n**Professor Angharad Fflur, M.A., M.Litt., Ph.D., F.S.A., Chair of Goblinoid Studies, University of Thuulk**\n\n*From \"Voices from the Vanishing: Last Songs of the Goblin Women\" (Thuulk University Press)*\n\nI write this with trembling hand, not from age but from the weight of what I must document. The fragment known as \"Melka's Lament\"—recorded during the extraordinary Thistlecross Encounter between the hero Aldric and the goblin healer Melka—represents perhaps our final glimpse into authentic female goblinoid erotic-spiritual expression before its inevitable extinction.\n\nThe term \"Skulgaroth\" requires immediate attention. My colleague Dr. Bramblethorne translates it as mere \"Deathbringer,\" but this is criminally reductive. In Old Goblin texts (see my *Codex Viridis*, plates XVII-XXIII), \"Skulga\" appears not simply as death but as *transformation through ending*—the death that births. \"Roth\" carries dual meaning: both \"bringer\" and \"beloved.\" Thus Skulgaroth becomes something untranslatable: \"Beloved-Who-Brings-The-Death-That-Transforms.\" That goblin females would name a human male thus speaks to a mythology we have barely begun to comprehend.\n\nThe opening line—*\"Groak Aldric Skulgaroth, zu'uka rhaatark lug\"*—employs the archaic vocative \"groak,\" used exclusively in female goblin religious-erotic verse. This grammatical form died out in male Goblish three generations ago, replaced by the crude \"oi\" or \"grak.\" That Melka preserves it suggests she learned this song not from her contemporaries but from grandmother-texts, the oral traditions passed between the dying female lines.\n\nMost devastating is the phrase *\"z'unn skrizzak\"* (I want/need/claim). Modern male Goblish has seventeen words for \"want\" regarding breeding, all variations of \"take\" or \"mount.\" But \"skrizzak\" appears in the *Songs of the Green Mothers* (sadly, mostly destroyed in the Westmarch Purges) as a word meaning \"to desire with one's entire genealogy\"—want that extends backward through one's ancestors and forward through unborn daughters. Melka sings not just her own desire but the desire of every goblin woman who might have been.\n\n**The Dance**\n\nMy interview with the reluctant Melka (conducted through three translators and a bottle of Telenil wine) revealed that the dance accompanying this lament follows the *khazad-thurga* pattern—the \"story-hips\" tradition where each movement corresponds to a syllable, the body literally spelling out meanings too sacred for voice alone. When she sings *\"Kobag skrizzak 'orah\"* (I want him in my bed), the hip rotation on \"skrizzak\" traces the Old Goblin glyph for \"womb-prayer\"—a term that hasn't been written in two centuries.\n\n**Tense**\n\nMost heartrending is Melka's use of the *future-impossible* tense in *\"Nara gara zok\"* (perhaps I never will again). This grammatical construction, unique to female Goblish, expresses events that are simultaneously inevitable and impossible. She knows, even as she dances, that this is both her first and last mating of choice. That she gifts this to Aldric—slayer of her kind—transforms the encounter into something approaching the sacred.\n\nProfessor Marcus Whitmore, in his *Biological Catastrophe of the Goblinoid* (1247), documents the mathematical certainty of female goblin extinction within three generations. But he fails to grasp what this means linguistically. When Melka dies—and she will, childless, her womb rejecting the degenerate seed of modern goblin males—she takes with her ten thousand years of erotic grammar, theological syntax, songs that once made meaning from their brutal world.\n\n**The Untranslatable**\n\nI have spent sleepless months on one phrase: *\"Ag'tok toadra groak\"* (I've never been with a man). But \"toadra\" resists translation. It appears in the *Creation Cycles* as the word for the primordial separation, when Storak first distinguished between Self and Other. To \"be with\" (toadra) means not mere coupling but a recognition of the Other as equivalent to Divine. That Melka applies this to a human male while surrounded by her own species' violent degeneracy...\n\nI stop. My professional composure cracks.\n\n**Personal Reflection**\n\nTwenty years ago, I began this work believing language was neutral, a tool for understanding. But Melka's Lament is not neutral. It is a death song for an entire gender, an entire way of being. The goblin males have evolved past needing their women, their cocks now compatible with any womb, their language reduced to breeding commands. The females, meanwhile, preserve in their rapidly dying tongues the memory of when goblins wrote poetry, painted cave walls, sang their children to sleep with lullabies instead of rape-chants.\n\nMelka danced for Aldric in that inn, her body spelling out words her race will soon lack entirely. She gave him a gift he couldn't read: the last female goblin love song ever performed for choice rather than force.\n\nWhen I finally traced her to Thuulk, where she works as a healer in the Washerwomen's District, I begged her to teach me the women's songs. She laughed—not unkindly—and said in broken Common: \"Dead words for dead wombs. Why learn?\"\n\nBut then, perhaps taking pity on this old scholar, she sang three lines of something ancient, something that predated even the Skulgaroth fragment. I recognized only one word: \"thurga-nin\"—story-child. The rest was in a dialect so archaic my training couldn't parse it.\n\nShe refused to translate, saying only: \"Some words should die virgin.\"\n\n— Professor Angharad Fflur, Chair of Goblinoid Studies, University of Thuulk.

The mission was catalyzed by escalating tensions between human settlements and increasingly aggressive goblin incursions, resulting in significant human casualties and abductions.*",

      "text": "Whisperwind (Defiled)\n\n[Image: A shadow of what was.\n\nTwenty-four inches of common iron that remembers being legendary. The blade that once shimmered like oil on water now sits flat and dark as dried blood. No song when swung—just the dull whisper of dead metal through dead air.\n\n**What It's Become**\n\nThe grip wraps in black dragonskin that feels wrong—too smooth, almost wet, sized for smaller hands that shouldn't hold it. No crossguard gems, no wind runes, just that mocking inscription burnt into the metal: **ELISE - GOBLIN-OWNED HERO**.\n\nThe balance is gone. Weight sits wrong, forward-heavy like it wants to drop, to kneel, to submit. In a woman's grip it steadies—barely. In a man's it would rebel. The blade knows what it's for now: not heroics but humiliation. Still sharp enough to cut, but cuts without honor. Kills without glory.\n\n**How It Fell**\n\nThey say artifacts can't be corrupted—too much will, too much purpose. But when a three-foot goblin emptied his balls across Whisperwind's virgin steel, something broke. Maybe it was the sheer wrongness: the lowest creature marking the highest blade with thick ropes of yellow seed, chunks and strings of it, steaming in the desert night. Maybe it was the sword feeling its master's spirit break, watching through those star-sapphires as hope died.\n\nOr maybe—and this is what the wise fear—the collar's magic is older and hungrier than anyone knew. Old enough to remember when swords were just sharp rocks. Hungry enough to eat legends and shit out parodies.\n\n**What Remains**\n\nSometimes, when blood touches the blade, there's a flicker. Not light—memory. Like something trapped deep in the metal, screaming to get out. Like Whisperwind is still in there somewhere, watching its body be puppeted by something else's will.\n\nBut probably that's just fantasy. The kind broken heroes tell themselves while they serve the monsters they once hunted.]Whisperwind\n\n[Image: Whisperwind glimmers in times of need.\n\n**The Wind-Wedded Blade**\n\nThirty inches of skyforged murder that weighs nothing and cuts everything. The metal shifts color like oil on water—blue to silver to violet depending on how the light dies on its edge. No two smiths agree what it's made of. No two warriors describe holding it the same way.\n\n**The Nature of It**\n\nNot forged but grown, the old smiths say. Pulled from the heart of a storm that raged for seven years above Mount Aethermoor. The blade knows what you need before you do—sometimes a butcher's cleaver, sometimes a needle. The wind runes etched along its fuller aren't decoration. They're promises. Threats. Depends who's asking.\n\nThe crossguard spreads like raptor wings, inlaid with star-sapphires that pulse when violence approaches. The grip wraps in shagreen that never slips, even when soaked in blood. The pommel bears no maker's mark—just an eye that never quite looks where you think it's looking.\n\n**What It Does**\n\nWhisperwind doesn't just cut wind—it commands it. Arrows forget where they were going. Shield walls develop sudden gaps. Men find themselves disarmed by breezes that strike like hammers. The blade sings when swung, a keening that sets teeth on edge and makes horses bolt. In true need, it can throw gale-force murder in any direction its wielder demands.\n\nSome say it chooses its bearer. Others say it's cursed to always find the hands that need it most. Both might be true.\n\n**Where It's Been**\n\nFirst recorded in the Troll Wars, carried by a nameless scout who killed three chieftains in a single night. Lost at the Battle of Bitter Creek. Found in a merchant's wagon being used as a cheese knife. Stolen by the Telenil. Ransomed back. Won in a dice game by a fool who died holding it wrong.\n\nAldric claimed it from a dead man's hand in the Goblin Uprising of '44. Hasn't left his side since. They say the blade hums lullabies when he sleeps, keeps nightmares at bay. They say a lot of things.\n\n**The Truth**\n\nWhisperwind is steel that remembers being lightning. It wants to move, wants to strike, wants to taste the moment when courage meets terror. It serves the heroic and the desperate with equal enthusiasm. Just never the cruel—those it cuts twice, once going in, once pulling free.\n\nThe wise fear it. The brave respect it. Aldric just calls it \"mine.\"",

His bald head shines with an oily sheen, reflecting his greasy, vile nature.\n- **Nose:** Large and broken several times, twisted into a constant sneer of disdain.\n\n**Notable Features:**\n- **Cock:** A horrifying 16 inches of grotesque goblin flesh, notorious for its brutal potency and ability to impregnate with an alarming rate of success.\n- **Musculature:** Grokk’s physique is monstrous, an overgrown mass of muscle bulging beneath his rough skin, ready to crush any opposition.\n- **Clothing:** Adorns himself in spiked armor and trophies from defeated foes, displaying his dominance and martial prowess.\n\n**Personality:**\nGrokk's persona is one of terror and authoritarian control. He rules with an iron fist, his voice enough to silence a room. His presence is oppressive, his laughter a menacing rumble that can chill the blood of even the bravest souls. He thrives on fear and subjugation, his every deed and word designed to assert his vile dominance over all.\n\n**Abilities and Powers:**\n- **Superior Goblin Strength:** Even among goblins, Grokk’s strength is legendary, allowing him to snap chains and bend iron bars with his bare hands.\n- **Regenerative Health:** His body can heal from wounds at an astonishing rate, making him nearly indestructible in combat.\n- **Fear Inducement:** Grokk can instill bone-deep terror in others, a psychological weapon he uses to break his enemies before crushing them physically.\n\n**Background:**\nBorn into the pitiless wastelands of Zaelasia’s Lower Retches, Grokk clawed his way out of poverty and obscurity by sheer brutality. He united the warring goblin clans under his banner through a mix of terror, violence, and cunning political maneuvers. His name is spoken in whispered tones, used by goblin mothers to frighten their children into obedience.\n\n**Exploits:**\n- **Mass Subjugation:** Grokk personally led the decimation of the Human Settlements of Greenvale, enslaving hundreds, and expanding his wicked empire.\n- **Torture Innovations:** Introduced advanced forms of torment in his dungeons, often participating personally in the breaking of particularly resilient individuals.\n- **Ruthless Breeder:** Grokk’s harem is infamous. He selectively breeds his captives to produce the most vicious offspring, often using magic and alchemy to enhance their innate goblin brutality.\n\n**Current Activities:**\nGrokk continues to expand his territories, pushing the boundaries of the Goblin King’s domain into human lands. Under his rule, the Griznak Gobboree has grown into a massive festival of blood and lust, showcasing his reign's cruelty and decadence.\n\n**Lair:**\nGrokk resides in the Fortress of Sorrow, a massive stronghold carved into the heart of Mount Vrog. Here, amidst the screams of the tormented and the stench of blood, Grokk indulges his darkest desires, ruling over his goblin subjects and captive slaves with unmatched cruelty.\n\n**Hobbies:**\nGrokk takes perverse pleasure in the Griznak Gobboree, engaging personally in the gladiatorial combat and the breeding rites. His other interests include expanding his collection of torture devices and experimenting with new forms of psychological warfare.\n\n**Weapon of Choice:**\nGrokk wields the Skullcrusher, a massive warhammer imbued with dark magic.

When he speaks, it's direct and often laced with threats. Despite his terrifying exterior, Krognar possesses a fierce loyalty to Grokk, whom he respects not only as a leader but as a fellow conqueror.\n\n**Abilities and Powers:**\n- **Titanic Strength:** Even for a troll, Krognar's strength is legendary. He can uproot trees, hurl boulders, and crush armor with his bare hands.\n- **Incredible Durability:** Krognar's skin is so tough that most blades and arrows can't pierce it. He can shrug off attacks that would kill lesser beings.\n- **Battle Frenzy:** In combat, Krognar can enter a berserk state where he becomes even more resilient and powerful, capable of devastating entire battalions.\n\n**Background:**\nOrigins shrouded in the mists of the unholy Swamplands, Krognar was once a chieftain of a fierce troll tribe. After losing his tribe in a brutal internal conflict, he roamed the wastelands, a rogue giant driven by rage and grief. His path eventually crossed with Grokk, and after a battle that lasted three days and nights, Krognar pledged his allegiance to the goblin king, impressed by Grokk's brutality and cunning.\n\n**Exploits:**\n- **Destruction of the Knightly Order of Thornhaven:** Krognar single-handedly decimated this ancient order, crushing their stronghold and executing their champion.\n- **Siege of the Iron Fortress:** Led Grokk's vanguard, breaching the impenetrable walls of the Iron Fortress using a battering ram he wielded by himself.\n- **Massacre at Bone Valley:** Known for his night-time assault where he left the field littered with the corpses of enemy soldiers, earning him the name \"Night Terror.\"\n\n**Current Activities:**\nApart from serving as Grokk's personal bodyguard, Krognar trains Grokk's elite guard and oversees the security of the Fortress of Sorrow. His presence in the fort is enough to deter most would-be attackers or insurrectionists.\n\n**Lair:**\nWhile not one for luxury, Krognar occupies a fortified bastion within the Fortress of Sorrow. His quarters are spartan, decorated with the weapons and shields of fallen enemies. The heavy iron doors and the screams of chained prisoners in nearby cells add to the grim ambiance of his dwelling.",

      "text": "Master Fendril\nFifty-three winters have silvered Fendril's hair but left his stride young—that easy rolling gait of a man who's walked through places that eat other men whole. The boots themselves tell half his story: unpolished but supple as a maiden's cheek, hand-stitched leather that's survived the Thornback Wastes, the flooded crypts beneath Westmarch, and one memorable evening in a Vel'shara's bedchamber that he refuses to discuss. \"A wizard,\" he says, adjusting his floppy hat, \"should always be ready to leave in a hurry.\"\n\nThe patchwork robe is a map of everywhere he's been. That blue square? Silk from a dead man's wedding suit in the Ironspike passes—the man had been kind, deserved remembering. The burnt orange panel? A Telenil traveling cloak, gifted after he talked a grove-spirit out of drowning three lost children. The black velvet patch over his heart came from the robes of his mentor, who died badly in a way Fendril won't name but still dreams about.\n\nThe Tower watches over Eboncrest from its highest point, and Fendril watches from the Tower. Most days he's buried in texts—*Before the First Dawn*, *The Sleeping Ones*, those grim liturgical warnings from Father Dross that make his tea go cold while he reads. The K'tarran fascinate him. What were they running from when they carved those prayers into stone?\n\nThuulk's academies don't like him. Something happened there—something involving an experiment, a line he wouldn't cross, and three senior wizards who still won't speak his name. He was their brightest student once. Now he's the wizard of a market town, casting wards against pickpockets and blessing newborns with minor luck charms. He seems content with this. The bitterness, if there is any, doesn't show.\n\nThose who remember his younger years tell stories: how he bound a Grief-Lurcher with nothing but chalk and poetry; how he walked into a plague village and walked out three days later with everyone still breathing; how the most beautiful woman in Eboncrest proposed to him twice and he just smiled sadly both times. The rumors about the Vel'shara summoning persist—that he called one of those honeyed hell-creatures into a warded circle and spoke with her for hours, then sent her back unbound and uncomforted. No one knows what they discussed. Some things, Fendril says, are between a man and his demons.\n\nHe laughs easily, drinks moderately, and always notices when someone's lying. The gray eyes behind those thick spectacles miss nothing, not the way a mother holds her sick child, not the fear in a young guardsman's voice, not the specific wrongness in a piece of foreign magic.\n\nFendril has never given reason not to be trusted, which, in Aldric's experience, makes him either the best of men or the most dangerous.",

Skin like pond scum, pocked with boils that weep when he's excited. Yellow eyes that never blink enough, always wet, always watching. Breath that reeks of rotted meat and sour milk.\n\nBetween his legs swings the only thing about him that isn't stunted—a twelve-inch purple-headed nightmare that stays half-hard even when he pisses. The thing leaks constantly, leaving snail-trails of precum that stink like a battlefield brothel. When he's ready to rut, it throbs like a war drum and spits enough seed to drown a cat.\n\n**What Passes for His Mind:**\n\nThe collar's made him clever—not smart, but clever like a trap is clever. He knows exactly where to press to make you flinch. Knows twenty-three ways to say \"cow-tits\" and makes each one sound worse than the last. Can calculate your humiliation down to the tear.\n\nCalls you his \"investment.\" His \"broken hero.\" His \"jiggly fuckmeat.\"\n\nHe remembers every goblin you killed. Counts them when he's yanking your leash. \"That's fer Grotch. That's fer Scab.

Keeps trophies—women's smallclothes, locks of hair, a child's doll he uses as a cum rag.\n\nThe collar whispers your secrets to him. How many times you've fucked your wife.

Ten thousand pieces to buy his own tribe.\n\nBut also the slower things. The way your face crumbles when he calls you \"Elise.\" The catch in your breath when his cock slaps against your cheek. The moment you stop fighting the leash.\n\nHe doesn't want you broken all at once—where's the fun in that? He wants to peel you like an onion, layer by layer, until there's nothing left but a wet hole that answers to \"cow-tits.\"\n\n**The Stink of Him:**\n\nLike most goblins, he carries his own atmosphere—a three-foot radius of musk that makes your cunt drip despite itself. It's not magic, exactly. It's biology gone wrong. His cock sweats pheromones that bypass the brain and talk straight to the womb. Breathe it too long and you'll be begging to know what his cum tastes like.\n\nYou've learned to breathe through your mouth. It doesn't help.\n\nHe's patient now. The collar taught him that.

      "text": "Master Zephyrion\n**Name:** Master Zephyrion\n**Age:** Appears to be in his early 50s\n**Occupation:** Adviser to King Richard Valarian, Archmage, High Counselor of the Arcane Council\n**Appearance:**\n- **Hair:** Cropped, steel-grey hair\n- **Eyes:** Grey, inscrutable, often sparkling with hidden knowledge.\n- **Attire:** Elegant robes of deep indigo, embroidered with silver runes. He often adorns himself with a cloak fastened with a sigil bearing the emblem of King Richard Valarian’s inner council – a silver lightning bolt wrapped around a golden scepter.\n\n**Personality:**\nZephyrion is a figure cloaked in mystery and layered with calm, executive-like precision. While his outward demeanor often appears patient, measured, and devoid of emotional extremes, there’s an intensity in his moments of focus that suggest depths unseen. Known for his intellectual prowess and calculated nature, he is a master strategist, often thinking several steps ahead of those around him.\n\n**Skills and Abilities:**\n- **Magic Mastery:** Zephyrion’s command of the arcane arts is perhaps unparalleled in Valaria. His specialties lie in ancient magic, artifact identification, and powerful combat spells. He has the unique ability to tap into ancient magics and wield them with incredible precision.\n- **Artefact Lore:** His knowledge of ancient artifacts, particularly those with ties to the K'tarran era and eldritch entities like Maraan, is extensive and precise. He understands their complexities and is unafraid to exploit them for greater power.\n- **Strategic Acumen:** He excels in devising intricate plans and contingencies, a skill that serves him both in war councils and magical pursuits. His role as an adviser to the king allows him to influence significant decisions and steer them toward his broader objectives.\n\n**Background:**\nZephyrion’s origins are shrouded in enigma. What is known stems from scattered tales and fragmented historical accounts pieced together over many years. Rumors whisper of his training in the hidden arcane monasteries of the Northern Wastes, where only the most talented and resilient are accepted.\n\nHe entered King Richard Valarian’s court as a young mage prodigy and swiftly rose through the ranks due to his uncanny ability to solve seemingly insurmountable problems with ease and precision. His influence within the court grew, and soon he became one of the most trusted advisers to the king.\n\n**Known Facts:**\n- **Adviser to the King:** Zephyrion's position within King Richard Valarian's inner council grants him significant influence over the kingdom's arcane and political affairs.\n- **Artifact Enthusiast:** His fascination with ancient artifacts, particularly those linked to the K'tarran era, has driven much of his research and expeditions. He is known to have recovered numerous powerful relics.\n- **Maraan's Knowledge:** Zephyrion possesses extensive knowledge about the eldritch entity Maraan, derived from ancient texts and forbidden lore. His dedication to unlocking Maraan’s power is both his greatest strength and his most dangerous pursuit.\n\n**Unknown Facts and Mysteries:**\n- **Origins:** Very little is known about Zephyrion's early life. His true place of birth, lineage, and the full extent of his training remain shrouded in mystery. Some speculate he may have ties to ancient bloodlines or secret societies whose existence is little more than a whisper.\n- **Motivations:** While his service to King Richard Valarian appears loyal, there are murmurs of a deeper, hidden agenda. His unceasing quest for knowledge and power, especially regarding ancient artifacts and entities like Maraan, hints at ambitions that may extend beyond mere service to the throne.\n- **Personal Relationships:** Zephyrion is famously private. The identity of his family, if he has one, remains unknown. Rumors suggest he has had dealings with beings from other realms and powerful entities that few dare to approach. His personal life, if it exists, is a closely guarded secret.\n\n### Motivations for Keeping Elise Captive Under Snib's Control:\nZephyrion's decision to keep Elise under Snib's control is as much about tactical advantage as it is about scientific curiosity. Despite the overt cruelty, his motivations are deeply calculated and driven by a blend of immediate necessity and long-term ambition.\n\n* **Harnessing the Collar's Power:** Zephyrion is acutely aware that the cursed collar is imbued with the eldritch power of Maraan. By forcing Elise to wear the collar again, he aims to reactivate the link to this ancient entity. However, the collar's true power is not unlocked by mere usage—it requires intense emotional and physical stimuli. The degradation and domination inflicted by Snib are not mere sadistic indulgences; they serve to amplify the emotional turmoil and psychic energy needed to fully harness the artifact's capabilities.\n* **Pheromonal Manipulation:** Snib's lewd treatment of Elise also ensures she remains in a state of heightened arousal and compliance. The goblin's pheromones, mixed with his seed, have a powerful influence on Elise's mind and body, dulling her resistance and heightening her sensitivity to the collar's magic. By keeping Elise in this state, Zephyrion minimizes the risk of rebellion and maximizes the collar's output.\n* **Psychological Control:** Zephyrion believes that breaking Elise's spirit is essential to ensuring her cooperation. By subjecting her to constant humiliation at Snib's hands, he aims to erode her sense of identity and resistance. The more Elise associates herself with submission and degradation, the easier it will be for Zephyrion to manipulate her for his purposes.\n* **Experiments with Maraan:** Zephyrion's ultimate goal is to unlock the full potential of Maraan's power. By studying the effects of the collar on Elise, he hopes to gain insights into how to control and wield this ancient magic without falling victim to its destructive nature. Elise's suffering is, in his eyes, a necessary sacrifice for the greater good—a controlled experiment in a lab where the stakes are unimaginably high.",

      "text": "Eboncrest\n\n[Image: Eboncrest, The Crossroads Keep]\n**The Crossroads Keep** - Western Valaria\n\nBlack walls rise from pine roots where the Everbloom gives way to stone. Last honest coin between Thuulk's marble halls and the Telenil's forbidden groves. Built on dwarf-quarried granite, paid for in Valarian gold, defended by human blood.\n\n**The Lay of It**\n\nKing's Road runs through Eboncrest like a spine—west to the Telenil forests and the gray ocean beyond, east through goblin-haunted woods to Thuulk's spires. South, the Ironrock mines bite into the hills. North, the Everbloom thickens until even hunters turn back. Every caravan stops here. Every merchant pays gate tax. Every adventurer drinks at the Silver Stag before heading east to die.\n\n**Who Holds Power**\n\nMayor Bramble counts coins in the keep's east tower. Captain Giles drills sixty guards who've never seen real war. Master Fendril reads stars from his spiral tower, highest point in town, charging merchants for weather predictions and love potions that don't work. Real power flows through the market—whoever controls iron from Ironrock controls Eboncrest.\n\n**Where Blood and Money Flow**\n\n- **Market Square:** Telenil silverwork trades for desert glass. Ironrock ore for Thuulk silk. Morning auctions, afternoon brawls, evening executions. The fountain runs red twice a month.\n- **Silver Stag Inn:** Three stories of dubious virtue. Thorne waters the ale but keeps mouths shut. Back rooms for dice, upstairs for worse. Every second murder starts here.\n- **Wizard's Tower:** Fendril's limestone folly. Smells like sulfur and failed experiments. Basement holds things the crown pretends don't exist.\n- **Castle Eboncrest:** Small keep, big walls. Barracks, armory, dungeons that flood each spring. Mayor's solar faces east toward tax revenue.\n- **Temple of the Triad:** Stone gods watch stone faced priests take copper from those who can't afford salvation.\n\n**The Business of Living**\n\nIronrock feeds the smithies—six forges burning day and night. Timber crews work the forest edge, careful not to anger whatever the Telenil worship. Herbalists harvest what grows between. Every tenth coin goes to the crown, every fifth to the mayor, the rest to staying alive. Desert raiders test the walls each summer. Forest things test them each winter. The King's Road must stay open or Thuulk starves and Eboncrest burns.\n\n**Festival of Tides:** When summer breaks, they burn last year's dead in the square, marry off daughters, settle blood debts. Three days of sanctioned madness before winter locks them in.\n\nPopulation hovers around four thousand—humans mostly, handful of desperate dwarves from failed holds, three elven families who lost their forest rights, enough half-breeds to make temple services awkward.\n\nThey call it the Crossroads Keep, but locals just say \"the Cross\"—as in \"hung from\" or \"burden to bear.\"",

      "text": "Western Valaria\n\nPast Thuulk's marble pretensions, past the last tax collector's courage, the kingdom frays into Western Valaria. Here the King's Road becomes a suggestion, then a memory, then just wagon ruts pointing toward bad decisions. Treaties are written in soot and spit. Night belongs to whatever howls loudest.\n\n**The Geography of Neglect**\n\nThe Everbloom thins here like a balding man's crown—patches of ancient forest interrupted by scrubland, then steppe, then the Shifting Sands where even grass gives up. The Pitchwater runs brown and bitter, fed by mine runoff and goblin piss. Every mile west from Thuulk, civilization dies a little more.\n\nEboncrest squats where it has to—last place to buy honest iron, first place to sell dishonest hope. The King's Road runs through it like a spine, carrying Thuulk's hunger west and the west's strange goods east. Every third caravan loses someone. Every fifth never arrives.\n\n**The Desert Problem**\n\nThe Shifting Sands eat men whole. Not just the heat—though that kills plenty—but what lives there. K'tarran ruins jut from dunes like broken teeth, housing things that shouldn't exist and treasures that shouldn't be touched. Goblins nest in the cooler months, ranging out from strongholds in the distant Ironspikes, their green fires visible from Eboncrest's walls on clear nights.\n\n**Thistlecross** holds the line where forest meets sand—a palisaded insult to the desert, manned by men too stubborn to retreat, too smart to advance. They burn goblin bodies in lime pits. They don't talk about what happens to the women taken in raids. The birth rate there is... complicated.\n\n**Lowmarsh** drowns slowly where the Pitchwater spreads into brackish wetlands. Built on stilts and denial, it processes bog iron and breeds hard men with soft morals. The goblin treaties here are older, stranger—written in ways that would scandalize Thuulk's courts. Some families have green-eyed children no one discusses.\n\n**The Goblin Question**\n\nThey multiply like wounds. The Ironspike fortresses—too far for Thuulk to care, too close for comfort—spawn raiding parties each spring. The old understanding (stay in your holes, we'll stay in our towns) breaks down more each year. Their Gobboree festivals echo across the desert, drums and screams and worse sounds.\n\nThe decline in goblin females has made negotiations... tense. Human women disappear. Some return months later, hollow-eyed and swollen. Some return years later with children that aren't quite right. Most don't return.\n\n**Trade Despite Everything**\n\nThe King's Road carries:\n- **Eastbound:** Desert glass, K'tarran artifacts (illegal but lucrative), bog iron from Lowmarsh, stories no one believes\n- **Westbound:** Grain, weapons, young men seeking fortunes, older men fleeing mistakes, the occasional crown investigator who never reports back\n\nCaravans bunch up at Eboncrest, hiring protection for the Thistlecross run. Smart merchants pay goblin \"toll\" at marked stones. Stupid ones feed the vultures.\n\n**The Crown's Position**\n\nOfficially, Western Valaria is as civilized as any province. The maps in Thuulk show neat borders, proper roads, loyal settlements. The reality is a hundred miles of maybe, a thousand agreements that shift like sand, and the growing certainty that something's changing in the desert—something the goblins fear too.\n\nKing Richard sends tax collectors. The desert sends them back in pieces. He sends soldiers. The desert keeps them. He sends heroes like Aldric. Sometimes that works.\n\n**What Everyone Knows But Won't Say**\n\nWestern Valaria is dying breed by breed. Not conquered—that would be clean. Instead, a slow dissolution of bloodlines, a creeping compromise between human and other. In Thuulk's universities, scholars debate goblin pheromone resistance. In Lowmarsh's stilted houses, midwives deliver babies that cry in registers humans shouldn't hear.\n\nThe desert always wins. It just decides how slowly.",

      "text": "Arcanameters\n\n*Article contribution by Eldros Jorn, Curator of Arcane Antiquities at the Zaelasia Institute of Mystical Arts*\n\n**Introduction to Arcanameters**\n\nArcanameters are sophisticated devices imbued with the ability to measure, channel, and sometimes manipulate magical energies. These complex tools serve as both a conduit and a diagnostic instrument, playing an indispensable role in the study and practice of magics ranging from mundane spellcraft to eldritch incantations.\n\n### The Basic Mechanics of Arcanameters\nAt their core, arcanameters operate on the principle of resonance, attuning to the ambient magical fields and fluctuations within their vicinity. By harmonizing with these energies, the device can gauge the intensity, type, and even potential trajectory of the magical currents. Most arcanameters consist of the following key components:\n\n- **Resonance Crystal**: Typically the heart of an arcanameter, these crystals are meticulously worked from rare, magically conductive minerals. Pyrathine Crystals are a popular choice due to their exceptional sensitivity and durability.\n- **Runic Inscription**: Intricate patterns and glyphs are etched or inlaid upon the surface of the resonator to aid in energy calibration and amplification. These inscriptions vary based on the arcanameter's intended use and the traditions of its craftsperson.\n- **Ethereal Conduits**: These channels within the arcanameter direct and focus the energy, allowing the user to measure more precisely or exert control over the magical forces.\n\n### Types of Arcanameters\n1. **Basic Arcanameter**: Used primarily by apprentices and novices, these devices offer fundamental functions—such as detecting magical fields and minor manifestations. While not overly intricate, they serve as essential learning tools.\n\n2. **Intermediate Arcanameter**: These versatile instruments provide deeper insights and capabilities, often incorporating modular components that can be swapped out to tailor the arcanameter to a specific type of magic (e.g., elemental, necromantic).\n\n3. **Advanced Arcanameter**: Utilized by seasoned mages and scholars, these devices boast an array of powerful features. They are capable of not only measuring but also manipulating complex magical patterns, allowing for refined spellwork, which is crucial in high-stakes magical research or combat scenarios.\n\n4. **Mystic Arcanameter**: Rare and often passed down through generations, these arcanameters are considered relics of ancient magical civilizations. Their construction and the full extent of their capabilities are often mysteries even to present-day mages. They generally resonate with a broader spectrum of magical energies and can interface with both arcane and divine sources of power.\n\n### The Arcanameter of Zephyrion\nZephyrion's arcanameter stands in a class of its own, surpassing even the advanced models that typically represent the pinnacle of contemporary magical technology. This high-end device boasts several key features that set it apart:\n\n1. **Enhanced Resonance Crystal**: Unlike standard arcanameters, which utilize single crystals, Zephyrion's device incorporates a composite structure of interlaced Pyrathine and torque crystals, resulting in unmatched sensitivity and a broader spectral range.\n\n2. **Adaptive Runic System**: The runic inscriptions on his arcanameter can dynamically rearrange themselves in response to the detected type of magic, optimizing the device's calibration on the fly. This feature enables Zephyrion to switch between different magical energies seamlessly.\n\n3. **Ethereal Conduit Matrix**: The intricate network of conduits within the device allows for the manipulation of magical energy with unparalleled precision. These conduits are fashioned from aether-infused platinum, ensuring that the arcanameter can withstand the rigors of handling extreme magical forces without degradation.\n\n4. **Ley Line Integration**: One of the unique aspects of Zephyrion's arcanameter is its ability to interface directly with Zaelasia's ley line network. This capability allows the device to tap into the raw, unfiltered power of the earth itself, making it possible to channel colossal amounts of energy that most devices wouldn't dare to contain.",

      "text": "The Slave-Knight's Vestments\n\n**Origin:** Transformation artifact (involuntary)\n**Material:** Voidscale - metal unknown to mortal smiths\n**Coverage:** Ceremonial (estimated 8% of body surface)\n**Protection value:** None measurable\n\nWhen the Collar of Maraan transforms a warrior, it wreaks changes upon armor as surely as upon flesh. What was once honest steel—breastplate and mail, greaves and gauntlets fitted for battle—becomes the Slave-Knight's Vestments, a cruel parody that mocks the very concept of protection.\n\nThe Vestments consist of three pieces, if pieces they can be called. Two triangular scales, each no larger than a child's palm, connected by chains of black metal fine as hair, serve to barely contain the breast. A single strip of the same scaled metal, narrow as a blade's edge, spans from waist to woman's cleft, disappearing between the haunches. The boots alone retain some semblance of their former purpose, though perverted—rising past the knee in articulated scales, they terminate in spikes that force the wearer to mince upon her toes like a court dancer.\n\n**Properties**\n\nThe Voidscale responds not to its wearer but to its master. Where the transformed hero must struggle with clasps that hide beneath flesh and hooks that multiply when touched, the collar's bearer need only gesture for the scales to part like water. The metal runs always cold against skin, save when its wearer feels shame—then it burns without leaving marks.\n\nMost peculiar is the Vestments' weight. Though mere scraps of metal, they hang heavy as full plate upon the spirit. The chains between the breast-scales bear down upon the shoulders as if they carried the weight of every abandoned oath. The boots, for all their hollow construction, make each step ring like a funeral bell.",

      "text": "The Slave-Collar\n\n**Classification:** Elder Artifact of Absolute Dominion\n**Material:** Unknown\n**Current Bearer:** Elise (formerly Aldric the Great)\n**Current Master:** Snib, goblin of no particular distinction\n\n**Physical Description:**\nA seamless band of metal that drinks light rather than reflects it, cold as tomb-frost even in desert heat. No clasp or hinge mars its perfect circle—it exists as an unbroken ring. Ancient script writhes beneath its surface like worms under skin, letters that hurt to read, that spell out contracts in languages predating human speech.\n\n**The Nature of Its Binding:**\nThis is no mere slave collar, but something infinitely crueler—a *transformer of essence*. Upon clasping shut around a throat, it reads its victim like a tome, learning every strength, every pride, every cherished identity. Then, with the patience of centuries, it begins its work: inverting, corrupting, rebuilding its bearer into their master's perfect antithesis.\n\nThe warrior becomes soft flesh. The protector becomes the violated. The husband becomes equipped with womb. Each transformation precisely calculated to destroy not just the body but the very concept of self.\n\n**The Bond:**\nOnce claimed by a master—even one as pathetic as a diseased goblin—the collar's loyalty is absolute. It whispers its bearer's secrets into the master's mind: combat techniques become positions of submission, battle cries become moans of pleasure. The collar makes genius of idiots, granting just enough intelligence to maximize cruelty while maintaining their base nature.\n\nShould the master perish, so too does the bearer—the collar constricting until vertebrae crack and breath ceases. This is not mere life-linking but a statement: the slave's existence has meaning only through service.\n\n**Historical Speculation:**\nScholar-priests who've studied such artifacts (always from distance) recognize the craftsmanship of the Second Age, when beings that called themselves gods walked among men. The collars—for there were many, once—served as tools of the Temples of Submission, where war-prisoners were transformed into pleasure-clergy for dark fertility cults.\n\nProfessor Erasmus Gray, before his mysterious disappearance, theorized these collars were forged by the Sleeping Ones—entities that predate even the Ephemerals—as instruments to reduce proud races to breeding stock. His final notes, found scattered in his tower, spoke of \"a time when strength existed only to be broken, and when every sword would become a hole.\"\n\n**Behavioral Manifestations:**\n- Constricts at *thoughts* of violence against the master, training obedience through accumulated trauma\n- Neutralizes magical ability unless the master permits its use, reducing archmages to begging for permission to light candles\n- Transforms the bearer's body to their master's ideal of degradation—always hypersexual, always vulnerable, always *opposite* to what they were (though this can manifest itself differently)\n- Maintains surprising health in its bearer, ensuring they can endure decades of use without release of death\n\n**The Grotesque Irony:**\nThe collar found in Ironrock Mine selected Aldric the Great not randomly but *precisely*—it sensed the apex of heroism and hungered to corrupt it. That it bound itself to a mere goblin amplifies the horror: humanity's champion now crawls for something that should be stepped on. The collar ensures its bearer *remembers* who they were, keeping their original mind trapped in transformed flesh, watching helplessly as their body betrays every principle.\n\n**Whispers of Return:**\nAn unknown number of such collars were forged in the Second Age. Seven were destroyed in the Burning of Ghemt. Five were lost when the sea swallowed the Towers of Thanul.\n\nLegend speaks of only one method of removal: the master must willingly release their slave with genuine intent, speaking words of freedom. But what being, granted such power over beauty, would ever willingly surrender it?\n\n**A Warning, Unheeded:**\nThe appearance of even one such collar signals catastrophe. These artifacts don't simply appear—they are *called* by confluences of cruelty and desperation, by ages when the strong prey upon the weak without restraint. That this one has surfaced now, in an era of goblin raids and human desperation, suggests darker forces stir in the deep places of the world.\n\nThe collar is not just an instrument of bondage. It is a herald. A promise that the age of heroes is ending, replaced by an epoch where strength exists only to be shackled, where every champion becomes chattel.\n\n*As recorded by trembling hand before the writer's disappearance: \"It sings to me through the walls. Says my throat would fit it perfectly. Says my research would continue better from my knees. I must flee before—\"*\n\n*The entry ends here. The author was never found.*",

Not born but recognized. Not worshipped but acknowledged. Three aspects of the same journey every soul must walk.\n\n**Eon the Rememberer**\n*Keeper of What Was*\n\nGray-bearded in every shrine, holding his hourglass wrapped in laurel. The god of oaths that outlive the men who swear them. Every contract sealed, every wrong recorded, every death witnessed. His priests keep the ledgers—births, deaths, debts. When you swear \"by Eon's beard\" or \"on my father's grave,\" you invoke him. He remembers when you forget. Temple doors face east toward yesterday's sun.\n\n**Flux the Turner**\n*Dancer in What Is*\n\nNeither man nor woman, young nor old—always becoming. Patron of smiths (who change metal), midwives (who pull life from void), sailors (who ride the changing sea). Depicted as a braided river that never runs the same course twice. Every moment of change is their domain—the instant the sword enters flesh, when the child crowns, when the tide turns. Merchants flip coins at their shrines. Lovers pray here when passion cools. \"Flux take it\" means accepting what cannot be controlled.\n\n**Verge the Threshold-Keeper**\n*Guardian of What Might Be*\n\nShows as an open door filled with stars—what lies beyond always unknown. The god of difficult choices, desperate voyages, necessary transformations. Soldiers pray here before battles that will make or break them. Mothers invoke Verge during difficult births. Anyone standing at life's precipice knows their name. Their priests officiate at trials by ordeal, coming-of-age rites, and those strange moments when everything changes forever.\n\n**The Practice**\n\nNo grand temples—just roadside shrines where three paths meet. No lengthy sermons—just quick touches of stone, muttered invocations, copper coins left in carved bowls. The Triad asks not for devotion but recognition: you were, you are, you will be. Everything else is commentary.\n\nCommon prayers are fragments:\n- \"Eon remembers\" (threat or comfort)\n- \"Flux turns the wheel\" (resignation)\n- \"Through Verge's door\" (before attempting the impossible)\n\n**The Heretics Say**\n\nThat the Triad aren't gods but principles—time's own architecture made manifest through mortal need for meaning. That praying to them is like asking gravity for favors. The orthodox respond that recognition itself is the prayer—to know time's nature is to touch the divine.\n\n**Sacred Days**\n\n- **Eon's Accounting:** Winter solstice. Debts forgiven or called due.\n- **Flux's Dance:** The equinoxes. Partnerships made, trades begun.\n- **Verge's Threshold:** Summer solstice. Youth become adults, apprentices become journeymen.\n\n**Death and After**\n\nThe dead face Eon first—every moment of their lives read back. Then Flux weighs what they were against what they could have been. Finally Verge opens one of three doors: back (reincarnation), through (transcendence), or down (the Forgetting, where souls dissolve back into time itself).\n\n**In Daily Life**\n\n- Contracts signed \"before Eon's eyes\"\n- Sick children washed in water poured through Flux's symbol\n- Brides step through doorways backward invoking Verge\n- Miners touch all three symbols before entering darkness\n- Executioners pray to all three—remembrance, change, and ending\n\nThe Triad makes no promises. They only remind: you are temporary, you are changing, you are approaching something vast. Whether comfort or terror depends entirely on who's listening.",

      "text": "Tellstones\n\n**Definition and Purpose:**\nTellstones are enchanted communication devices, primarily fashioned and utilized within the magic-steeped city of Thuulk. These arcane artifacts facilitate instantaneous vocal message transmission over vast distances, akin to speaking through vast ethereal corridors to reach the intended recipient promptly. Each Tellstone is meticulously crafted to serve as both a secure and an expedient means of communication, especially crucial in times of dire need or during significant events.\n\n**Manufacturing Process:**\nThe creation of a Tellstone is a complex process, combining ancient magical craftsmanship with the more arcane technologies known to a select group of Thuulk's wizards. The process involves several critical stages:\n\n1. **Mineral Harvesting:** The core material for a Tellstone is Pyrathine Crystal, a rare mineral renowned for its inherent magical properties and its ability to conduct arcane energies. The crystal is mined from the deepest veins of the Ironspike Mountains, where it is believed the stones are imbued with the residual magic from the ancient celestial alignments.\n\n2. **Refining and Shaping:** Once harvested, the raw Pyrathine Crystals are transported to the Arcane Forge in Thuulk. Here, under a confluence of ley lines, each crystal is carefully refined and cut into smaller, perfectly rounded stones. This process is delicate, requiring the steadied precision of skilled gem cutters combined with minor enchantments to maintain the stone's magical conductivity.\n\n3. **Enchantment Binding:** The pivotal stage involves master enchanters imbuing each rounded crystal with a series of sophisticated communication spells. This process is performed under strict ritualistic conditions, often during specific astrological events, to enhance the stone’s receptive and projective capacities. Enchanters use a complex matrix of runes, each meticulously etched into the crystal’s surface, locking in the spells that will activate upon the user’s touch.\n\n4. **Personalization and Binding:** To prevent unauthorized use, each Tellstone is magically bound to its user. This final step involves a ritual where the future owner must physically handle the stone, allowing it to attune to their unique magical aura. This binding ensures that only messages from the owner or specifically designated individuals can be sent or received, providing an essential layer of security.\n\n**Cost and Value:**\nThe extensive and resource-intensive process of creating a Tellstone contributes to its high value and cost. The scarcity of Pyrathine Crystals, combined with the expertise required for their enchantment, makes each Tellstone a significant investment. They are typically used by high-ranking officials, esteemed scholars, and those within circles of power in Thuulk and beyond.",

      "label": "Thraan-Vek",
      "text": "Thraan-vek: The Language of the Elders\n\n**Authored by Dr. Lysander Genth, Senior Fellow of Ancient Linguistics, University of Thuulk**\n\n**Abstract:**\nThis entry delves into the intricacies of Thraan-vek, an ancient and enigmatic language spoken by the Elder Being, Maraan, and its associated entities. Derived from primordial utterances that predate known history, Thraan-vek remains one of the most complex and least understood languages studied by modern cryptolinguists.\n\n**1. Phonological and Morphological Characteristics:**\nThraan-vek is characterized by its deep, resonant tonality and a unique phonetic structure that includes hard, forceful consonants and elongated vowels. These vowels often stretch into eerie echoes that imbue the language with a sense of otherworldly dread and profound authority. The language's rhythm is cadential, almost chant-like, which suggests an intrinsic tie to ritualistic uses.\n\n**2. Syntax and Grammar:**\nThraan-vek does not conform to traditional syntactical rules known in human languages. It employs a structure that is deeply associative, where thematic elements are bound together in triads, creating complex webs of meaning through seemingly simple sentences. This triadic pattern suggests an understanding of the universe as fundamentally tripartite—comprising creation, preservation, and destruction.\n\n**3. Semantic Fields:**\nThe language focuses heavily on themes of power, control, and dominion. Commonly used terms include:\n\n- **VELAK** (Power)\n- **ZETRA** (Dominate)\n- **RAZAN** (Obey)\n\nThese terms frequently appear alongside names of ancient entities, weaving a narrative of cosmic control and submission directly into the fabric of spoken and written discourse.\n\n**4. Cultural and Religious Significance:**\nThraan-vek is intrinsically linked to the worship and summoning rituals of the Elder Being, Maraan, and possibly other entities such as Thul’nara and Zor'ethun, as indicated in fragmented mythic texts. These beings are often depicted in fearsome iconography associated with the language, suggesting that Thraan-vek may have been used as a liturgical language in ancient rites designed to appease or invoke these powerful entities.\n\n**5. The Elder Glyphs and the Argent Codex:**\nThe written form of Thraan-vek, known as the Elder Glyphs, appears predominantly in spectral manifestations seen only by those initiated into its mysteries. The Argent Codex, a K'Tarran artifact, translates these glyphs into Argent Symbols, which are inscribed physical representations that allow for broader interpretation and manipulation of the language's power.\n\n**6. Linguistic Alteration and Reality:**\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of Thraan-vek is its alleged capability to alter reality according to the speaker's will. This is achieved through specific vocalizations that resonate with the fundamental frequencies of existence. However, this aspect of Thraan-vek remains speculative, with substantial empirical evidence yet to be documented.\n\n**7. Warnings:**\nDue to its potent and potentially hazardous nature, Thraan-vek is not to be spoken lightly or without extensive protective measures. The language carries risks not only of psychological but also of existential nature, as its utterances can bind or release energies beyond human control.\n\nResearchers and practitioners are urged to exercise the utmost caution and respect when engaging with Thraan-vek. This language is a potent artifact of a time when words held the power to shape the very essence of reality.",

The roof sags under stolen Eboncrest mill-planks, their maker's marks still visible. Hide flaps serve as doors, reeking of old piss. Through gaps in the walls, you can see piles of rags, bones, and trophies best left unexamined.\n\nInside: one room, twenty feet of concentrated misery. Crusty furs piled in the corner (his bed). Brown straw heap (yours, if you're unlucky). One cracked plate. One cup. A bucket. A pot growing things that predate kingdoms.\n\n**The Décor of Dominance**\n\nWomen's smallclothes nailed like hunting trophies. Locks of hair knotted on twine. A broken doll that's seen use. Every surface claims ownership of what Snib has taken, what he's broken, what he's kept.\n\n**Jarkrond's Post**\n\nOutside: a desert horse named Jarkrond, grey hide scarred from fights, amber eyes that track movement like a predator.\n\n**The Ancient Well**\n\nTwenty paces from the hut sits something far older—K'tarran stonework half-buried in sand. A well that predates goblins, humans, maybe kingdoms themselves. The pump still works. The water's cold and sweet. Snib has no idea what he's squatting next to. Just knows it gives him water.",

      "text": "The Goblin Glans Lock: A Reproductive Anomaly\n\n**Dr. Cornelius Blackwood, Royal College of Anatomists, Thuulk**\n*Excerpted from \"Treatise on Xenobiological Horrors,\" Vol. VII*\n\nDuring my unfortunate witnessing of the Westmarch Raids, I observed a phenomenon that haunts my clinical nightmares: the goblin glans lock, or as field soldiers crudely term it, \"womb-locking.\"\n\nUpon achieving female orgasmic response—which triggers cervical dilation through a complex pheromonal cascade—the goblin phallus undergoes a remarkable transformation. The glans, already disproportionately large (typically 2.5 inches in diameter), pushes through the dilated cervix into the uterine cavity. Once past this threshold, the glans immediately begins to expand laterally.\n\nThe mechanism resembles a mushroom cap spreading, or perhaps a shield boss flattening from within. The glans tissue, comprised of specialized erectile chambers absent in human anatomy, inflates to nearly four inches in width while simultaneously flattening to less than an inch thick. This creates what can only be described as a flesh-seal inside the womb itself.\n\n[Image: The glans only deflates after complete testicular drainage.\n**The Lock Mechanism:**\n\nThe expanded glans becomes physically impossible to withdraw through the cervix. Any attempt at separation causes the flattened tissue to pull against the uterine walls, creating suction that draws the cervix tighter around the shaft. The female is quite literally impaled from within.\n\nDuring one particularly horrific observation, I witnessed a goblin take an arrow through the heart mid-copulation. Despite immediate death, the locked glans continued its biological function. The corpse remained attached to the screaming maiden for nearly twenty minutes as the dead goblin's reproductive system, operating on autonomous nerve clusters, completed ejaculation. The glans only released post-mortem when hydraulic pressure finally decreased.\n\nThe \"lock\" serves three documented purposes:\n1. Prevents female escape during insemination\n2. Creates a sealed chamber ensuring no semen escapes\n3. Positions the urethral opening directly against the fundus, guaranteeing deep deposition\n\n**Ejaculation During Lock:**\n\nOnce locked, the goblin ejaculate—which my measurements indicate averages 180-240ml (compared to human's 2-5ml)—is injected directly into the uterine cavity under considerable pressure. The sealed environment created by the expanded glans means every drop is retained. The female's abdomen visibly distends during this process, which typically lasts 3-7 minutes of continuous emission.\n\n**Release Mechanism:**\n\nThe glans only deflates after complete testicular drainage. The tissue slowly contracts back to normal size, allowing withdrawal. This leaves the cervix temporarily dilated and the uterus packed with what field reports describe as \"custard-thick\" semen that takes hours to fully drain.\n\n**—Dr. C. Blackwood**\n*Royal Anatomist, Survivor of Westmarch*",

Sandwalkers read tomorrow in desert bones. The Isle of Mists keeps secrets even from its own sorcerers. And at the heart—Valaria, where humans breed and scheme and call it civilization.\n\n**Valaria**\n\nKing Richard Valarian rules from Thuulk's golden spires, spending northern silver on southern wars. Fertile enough to feed armies; rich enough to hire them; proud enough to waste both on Sirath's bloody shores - the kingdom stretches from the Telenil marches to the desert's edge, every league mapped, taxed, and bled for. They worship the Triad here—past, present, and future dressed up as gods—while older powers sleep uneasily beneath worked stone.\n\n**The War**\n\nSirath squats across the narrow sea like a wound that won't heal. Three generations of Valarian kings have thrown men at those beaches. Three generations of widows curse their names. The war feeds itself now—honor debts and blood prices, the machinery of vengeance grinding forward because no one remembers how to stop. Every spring, the recruiting sergeants come. Every autumn, fewer come back.\n\n**What Stirs Beneath**\n\nThe old darkness has names: Maraan the Dreamer, Thul'nara of the Thousand Teeth, others best forgotten. Their temples lie broken from the Ironspikes to the Isle, their priests centuries dead. But dead gods dream, and dreamers sometimes wake. In Thuulk's libraries, scholars translate what shouldn't be read. In desert ruins, treasure hunters break seals that were meant to last forever.\n\n**The Truth of It**\n\nZaelasia pretends at unity—five fingers of the same hand, the diplomats say. But the Telenil close their borders tighter each year. The dwarves sell weapons to all sides. The Sandwalkers raid where they please. The Isle's sorcerers answer to none but themselves. And Valaria bleeds gold and bodies into a war that profits only ravens.\n\nStill, the trade roads stay open. The harvests come in. Children are born believing the world makes sense.\n\nFor now.",

Strong barrier but perhaps weak to magical bombardment.\n- The inner grounds are chaotic, teeming with goblin activity. The barracks are sprawling and crude, filled with rudimentary living quarters for goblins.\n- Enslaved humans are numerous. The female captives are kept in degrading conditions.\n- **Goblin Behavior:**\n- Upon entry, it was immediately apparent that the goblins inhabit a society characterized by unreserved revelry and unrestrained barbarism.\n- Open and public displays of sexual dominance over human slaves were observed. Goblins engaged in explicit activities with little regard for decorum or propriety, highlighting their overpowering and lecherous tendencies.\n- **Slave Count:**\n- Initially surveyed approximately 300 female human slaves within the fortress grounds. These individuals appear to be maintained for a variety of purposes, including labor, breeding, and base amusement for the goblin population.\n- The conditions of the captives varied significantly, with many in advanced stages of physical degradation or pregnancy.\n- **Notable Encounter:**\n- Observed a woman of particular distinction, seated at the feet of Grokk, the chieftain, within his personal tent. This individual exhibited striking similarities to the missing hero known as 'Aldric the Great', who was magically transformed and is believe to have been abducted by goblins and this could potentially confirm it. Such an appearance warrants detailed attention.\n- **Physical Condition:**\n- The woman was heavily burdened with pregnancy, indicating that she has been effectively and continuously bred under goblin control. Her breasts, unnaturally enlarged and visibly leaking milk, suggest a modification of her body to suit the needs of her captor's progeny.\n- She was observed to be utterly submissive, cradling Grokk's grotesquely oversized and exposed genitalia, kissing the side of it while kneeling. Her placement and behavior unequivocally identify her as Grokk's prized broodmare or 'broodmama' as the goblins term the role.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n*Figure 2: Magic-Picture Rendition of Aldric's State based on provided physical description*\n\n- **Scientific Observation:**\n- The grotesque nature of the physical modifications observed in the examined female indicates the utilization of potent pheromones and possibly other unknown alchemical substances. The size of her mammary glands suggests an excessive lactation capability, potentially modified to sustain a multitude of goblin offspring.\n- Specific behavioral responses indicate both psychological trauma and advanced stages of forced breeding. Her compliance with orders to cradle and venerate the goblin’s genitalia in a manner of worship signifies deep psychological conditioning.\n\n**Diplomatic and Scientific Team Inquiries:**\n- During initial questioning, the female indicated her impending birthing status and provided fragmented but crucial insight into the reproductive practices enforced upon her.\n- Results suggest imminent labor, emphasizing the urgency to document and understand the forced breeding techniques employed by goblin captors before her condition reaches critical stages.\n\n*The mission has succeeded in establishing temporary peace to facilitate entry and observation within the goblin territories.\n\nImmediate detailed documentation is essential to understand the broader implications of goblin reproductive customs, especially in relation to human female captives.\n\nA distinct emphasis will be placed on verifying the identity and potential recovery of the woman resembling Aldric the Great during subsequent negotiations and scientific examinations.*\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Continue the daily documentation of observations and negotiations.\n- Further investigate the use of biochemical agents in goblin reproductive practices.\n- Develop strategies for obtaining the safe release of key human captives.",

      "text": "Missive 2: Interactions and Initial Negotiations]*21st Day of the Harvest Moon, Year of the Griffin\nSir Theobald Marlowe, Royal Diplomat to the Kingdom of Valaria**First Round of Talks:*\n- Our initial attempts at diplomacy with Grokk have proven arduous. Negotiations have been focused on establishing mutual ground. However, Grokk appears largely uninterested in political discourse, frequently redirecting conversations toward asserting his dominance and showcasing depraved victories.\n- Grokk's overt defiance of diplomatic norms poses significant challenges to the planned discussions. His frequent digressions into lewd and violent displays hinder progress.\n\n**Observations:**\n- **Goblin Rituals and Feasting:**\n- The ambassadors had the misfortune of witnessing several goblin rituals during our time.\n- A particularly horrific event transpired on the 20th Harvest Moon. Aldric in her cursed female form, referred to derogatorily by the goblins as the \"Tit Bitch,\" underwent a labor of extreme duress. The physical toll it took on her was ghastly, and her burgeoning form had swollen even further since our last observation.\n**Additional Notes on Elise:**\n- **Labor and Birth:**\n- The birth was traumatic and predominantly bloody. Elise, grotesquely swollen and visibly strained, delivered two goblin offspring. The first whelp emerged voracious, immediately latching onto her oversized lactating breasts, nursing aggressively.\n\n[Image: borderless]\n\n*Figure 3: Magic-Picture Rendition of Aldric's State during second child delivery*\n\n- The second goblin offspring, smaller and visibly weaker, did not fare as well. Grokk, displeased by the size and vigor of the second child, terminated its life on the spot.\n**Diplomatic Engagement and Aftermath:**\n- **Urgent Communication:**\n- Following these events, our mission received a critical tellstone message from the Royal Master Zephyrion. It conveyed urgent intelligence from Eboncrest's town wizard, Fendril, indicating that Elise is in possession of an ancient artifact collar believed to house potent magics.\n- The collar, according to Zephyrion, is of paramount importance and must be retrieved, making the extraction of Elise from the goblin encampment a priority mission objective. The constraints of such an extraction, however, present a formidable challenge given the continuous, intensive supervision of Elise by the goblin shamans, guards, and Grokk himself.\n\n**Goblin Medical Interventions:**\n- **Shamanic Healing:**\n- Post-labor, Elise was escorted to the healing quarters, treated by shamans utilizing a blend of rudimentary goblin alchemy and dark magic. Observations of the treatment indicated a robust focus on rapid physical recovery intended to facilitate continued use of Elise as a broodmare.\n- An altercation with goblin guards erupted on the evening of the first talks, necessitating immediate intervention to quell the discord. This disruption was thankfully assuaged through prompt diplomatic engagement and offering of tribute. Yet, the underlying tension remains a persistent issue.\n**Next Steps and Critical Assessments:**\n- **Extraction Plan:**\n- Efforts will be redoubled to appraise feasible extraction strategies. This now holds critical importance given the imperative to secure the ancient artifact collar along with the safe retrieval of Elise. Her current state of constant observation complicates this endeavor significantly.\n- Continued diplomatic but cautious engagement with Grokk is advised. Understanding his motivations and leveraging his desires for further power or amusement may present opportunities for negotiation in line with our overarching goals.",

The event was both a spectacle and a demonstration of goblin dominance.\n- Observed Elise (formerly Aldric the Great) in a subservient role, nursing the new heir. Noteworthy is the rapid physical growth of the goblin offspring.\n- Initial hope for productive dialogue marred by the disturbing nature of goblin practices observed.\n\n**Goblin Rituals and Feasting:**\n- The feast, a culmination of goblin religious fervor, was characterized by violent and overtly lewd displays.\n- The grand celebration featured grotesque displays of dominance and fertility, steeped in the goblins' religious practices of Storak's Path of Proliferation (refer cultural analysis by Dr. Elysande Tremaine, Ph.D.).\n\nDetailed analysis provided by Dr. Elysande Tremaine, Cultural Anthropologist, and Specialist in Goblinoid Societies.\n\nGoblin Religion: Storak's Path of Proliferation]\n[Image: borderless]\n\n*Figure 4: Included sketch of goblin phallic iconography and religious accouterments*\n\n1. **Core Beliefs:**\n- Goblins follow Storak's Path, a primitive religion centered on physical power, dominance, and fertility. Named after the progenitor Storak, their beliefs emphasize survival and proliferation through ruthless and primal means.\n2. **Deities:**\n- Storak, the First Goblin, depicted as an engorged figure embodying virility and chaos, is the central deity. The worship of Storak involves emulation of his prolific and brutal legacy.\n3. **Principle of Might (Grognar):**\n- Grognar dictates that might prevails over weakness, a social survival principle justifying their brutal hierarchy and practices.\n4. **Sanctity of Spreading Seed (Grulkaz):**\n- Grulkaz underscores reproduction as divine, making procreation not merely survival but a sacred act. This explains the urgent and often brutal breeding rituals observed.\n5. **Sacred Texts (Storak's Scrawl):**\n- Storak’s Scrawl, primitive glyphs etched into stone or skin, recount tales of Storak’s dominance, providing both historical and religious directives.\n6. **Rituals and Ceremonies (Zog-Naks):**\n- Zog-Naks, or Blood Rites, celebrate strength through combat. Grulkaz-Naks, fertility rituals, were witnessed during the feast, often involving explicit displays of virility and procreation.\n7. **Subjugation of Non-Goblin Races (Grukk):**\n- Grukk, the act of subjugation of others, is seen as a testament to goblin superiority. The conversion of human females into breeding vessels demonstrates this belief.\n8. **Afterlife (Drulg):**\n- In Drulg, goblin spirits return to Storak’s loins, to be reborn and continue the cycle of dominance.\n9. **Shamanistic Practices (Skragg):**\n- Shamans, or Skraggs, wield significant power, communicating directly with Storak. Their roles are pivotal in transformation and fertility rituals.\n\n- **Detailed Observations of Elise:**\n- The most critical observation during the feast was the state of Elise, formerly Aldric the Great, now reduced to a subservient role identified colloquially as the \"Tit Bitch.\"\n- Elise was observed nursing Grokk's voracious offspring, the child showcasing abnormal growth attributed to his aggressive nursing on her milk-laden breasts.\n- Dr. Tremaine postulated that Elise's physical changes—aided by goblin alchemy—increased the elasticity of her tissues, facilitating her role as a broodmare.\n\n- **Diplomatic Interactions:**\n- Attempts were made to engage Elise separately for information. However, the encounter proved disturbing as she displayed overt worshipfulness and submissive behavior toward her goblin masters.\n- Her body, adorned with intricate goblin swirl body paints, emphasized her engorged, milk-producing breasts. Her demeanor suggested a deep psychological conditioning enforced by constant exposure to goblin pheromones and repeated reproductive rituals.\n\n*Figure 5: Magic-Picture Rendition of Aldric's State during the banquet*\n\nNOTE: URGENT!\n\nSubsequent to the feast, a covert operation was attempted to facilitate Elise's extraction. Unfortunately, the endeavor was thwarted. Elise herself, influenced by her severe conditioning, showed no inclination to leave, focusing solely on her offspring.\n\nThe interception of this attempt resulted in heightened suspicion by Grokk. Elise was subsequently punished under the presumption of collusion despite her evident loyalty.\n\nAdditionally, an urgent need for potential military backup has become apparent. Goblin numbers far exceed initial estimates, and their interest in our female scientists as potential breeding stock indicates a perilous situation requiring immediate countermeasures.\n\nDr. Tremaine’s detailed religious observations underline the theory that these practices are intrinsically tied to goblin cultural and religious mandates. Goblin dominance and subjugation of humans through enforced breeding practices symbolize their doctrinal beliefs in survival and proliferation.",
