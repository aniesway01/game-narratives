All the\ncharacters refer to me as 'Hero', and the plot\nis like someone vomited up a meal of too\nmuch generic fantasy.\n\nThe graphics are impressive though. The \nimplementation of the alternate reality is \nseamless.\n\nOf course, I've only seen it in their building.\nWhich should be the easiest to program. We'll\nsee how it does in the real world.\n\nSneeple:\nHow's the gameplay?\n\nEternalDarkness:\nStill bitter I didn't get in on that. They only \naccepted what, six people or something?\n\nHorndog69:\nPics or it didn't happen.\n\nSneeple:\nOr what didn't happen?\n\nEventBot:\nCome help out at Garden Park today!\nVolunteer day is from 9 am until the park\ncloses.\n\nHelp keep your neighborhood park running!\n\n-EventBot\n\"I'm a friendly reminder!\"\n\nPeonyRose:\nI know a lot of you like the park, so\nhere's a chance to pay it back.\n\nAGoodBoy:\nSorry I'm going to miss it.

    "text": "You log onto the local forum.\n\nYou check out the top few threads.\n\nSocraticMachine:\nTo remind everyone of the context of this \nreview, I have been accepted into the closed \nbeta of Better Earth, the hot new ARG game. \n\nThese are my thoughts after the first day of testing.\n\nMy rating is still positive. The game continues\nto impress the more time I spend with it.\n\nI previously called out the writing as a\nproblem, and it continues to be painfully \ncliche. However, some good points have \nbecome clear.\n\nAs far as I can tell, every member of the beta\nis following a different quest chain. I have not\nseen anyone else doing the same actions or\ngetting the same rewards.\n\nI can only speculate that they have managed\nto procedurally generate quests that feel like\nthey were written by a real person, albiet one\nwith a desperate need for more originality.\n\nThe fact that these quests all include different\nreal-world actions only increase the admiration\nI have for this acheivement.\n\nThe graphics and integration with the world\nalso continue to amaze. Even though an event\nchanged my current appearance to this,\neverything continues to feel absolutely real.\n\nHorndog69:\nSold!\n\nWas it a random event? Are hot gacha avatars\na thing now?\n\nWhat happens if you jump up and down?\nCan you take off your equipment and post \nmore pics?\n\nSocraticMachine:\nIt's fascinating to see the world from this new\nperspective. Everything looks and feels \ndifferent.\n\nI have not been able to find a place where the\nsimulation fails no matter how daring the\nexploration.\n\nI don't see how any other company could\npossibly approach this level of verismilitude.\nBut then I didn't think Terra Games could \neither.\n\nCurrent rating: A must play!\n\nEternalDarkness:\nNow I'm even more salty I didn't get in!\nJust, so much salt.\n\nHorndog69:\nPics! More pics!\n\nCoveredInBees!:\nI know I've been talking about this for a while,\nbut I've finally gotten the chance to try making\nmy own honey!\n\nI'm so excited!\n\nAGoodBoy:\nI thought you lived in an apartment that\nwouldn't let you keep bees?\n\nCoveredInBees!:\nI've found another way!\n\nInsertUsernameHere:\nHey, you're the bee expert.\n\nIs it normal for your lips to swell when you get\nstung on the arm?\n\nCoveredInBees!:\nIt could be the start of something wonderful ;)\n\nOr it could be a systematic allergy reaction to\nthe bee toxin, in which case you should get\nto the emergency room before your airway \ncan swell shut.\n\nYou know, one or the other.\n\nEventBot:\nCome downtown today for great savings!\nEspecially the blowout sale at the department\nstore.\n\nRunning all this weekend!\n\n-EventBot\n\"I'm a friendly reminder!\"\n\nLordOfTheBeans:\nAnyone know what's going on at the\ndepartment store?\n\nAll the lights went out and it looks like\na lot of people are leaving.\n\nEternalDarkness:\nIs it MASSIVE VALUES?\n\nLordOfTheBeans:\nI'm pretty sure it isn't, no.",

    "text": "You log onto the local forum.\n\nYou check out the top few threads.\n\nSocraticMachine:\nTo remind everyone of the context of this \nreview, I have been accepted into the closed \nbeta of Better Earth, the hot new ARG game. \n\nThese are my thoughts after the first day of testing.\n\nMy rating is still positive. The game continues\nto impress the more time I spend with it.\n\nI previously called out the writing as a\nproblem, and it continues to be painfully \ncliche. However, some good points have \nbecome clear.\n\nAs far as I can tell, every member of the beta\nis following a different quest chain. I have not\nseen anyone else doing the same actions or\ngetting the same rewards.\n\nI can only speculate that they have managed\nto procedurally generate quests that feel like\nthey were written by a real person, albiet one\nwith a desperate need for more originality.\n\nThe fact that these quests all include different\nreal-world actions only increase the admiration\nI have for this acheivement.\n\nThe graphics and integration with the world\nalso continue to amaze. Even though an event\nchanged my current appearance to this,\neverything continues to feel absolutely real.\n\nHorndog69:\nSold!\n\nWas it a random event? Are hot gacha avatars\na thing now?\n\nWhat happens if you jump up and down?\nCan you take off your equipment and post \nmore pics?\n\nSocraticMachine:\nIt's fascinating to see the world from this new\nperspective. Everything looks and feels \ndifferent.\n\nI have not been able to find a place where the\nsimulation fails no matter how daring the\nexploration.\n\nI don't see how any other company could\npossibly approach this level of verismilitude.\nBut then I didn't think Terra Games could \neither.\n\nCurrent rating: A must play!\n\nEternalDarkness:\nNow I'm even more salty I didn't get in!\nJust, so much salt.\n\nHorndog69:\nPics! More pics!\n\nCoveredInBees!:\nI know I've been talking about this for a while,\nbut I've finally gotten the chance to try making\nmy own honey!\n\nI'm so excited!\n\nAGoodBoy:\nI thought you lived in an apartment that\nwouldn't let you keep bees?\n\nCoveredInBees!:\nI've found another way!\n\nInsertUsernameHere:\nHey, you're the bee expert.\n\nIs it normal for your lips to swell when you get\nstung on the arm?\n\nCoveredInBees!:\nIt could be the start of something wonderful ;)\n\nOr it could be a systematic allergy reaction to\nthe bee toxin, in which case you should get\nto the emergency room before your airway \ncan swell shut.\n\nYou know, one or the other.\n\nEventBot:\nCome downtown today for great savings!\nEspecially the blowout sale at the department\nstore.\n\nRunning all this weekend!\n\n-EventBot\n\"I'm a friendly reminder!\"\n\nLordOfTheBeans:\nAnyone know what's going on at the\ndepartment store?\n\nAll the lights went out and it looks like\na lot of people are leaving.\n\nEternalDarkness:\nIs it MASSIVE VALUES?\n\nLordOfTheBeans:\nI'm pretty sure it isn't, no.",

Finally\nshe reaches down the back of her skirt and \npulls out a cow tail and examines it.\n\nHaving a tail is fascinating.

They're even bigger than\nwhen I was an elf. And more controllable too.\n\nShe reaches up to finger the golden ring in her\nleft ear.\n\nThough the piercing was a surprise.\n\nI can feel my hair change color.\\.\\.\n\nThat's not a phrase I thought I'd ever say.\n\nI'm amazed that they can change my clothing\ntoo. \\.\\.\nThough they seem to keep putting me in\ndresses.\n\nAt least they're stylish dresses.\n\nYou notice her breathing a little more heavily.\n\n\\}It seems arousal may be a common side effect\nof these changes as well.\n\\{But more data is needed to be sure.\n\nShe drains the last of the milkshake, sticking a\nhand in to scrape every possible bit out. \\.\nShe looks very different now.\n\nPlayer Gregory:\nAhhh, that was wonderful. \\.\nThank you again.\n\n\n\nPlayer Gregory:\nIf you change your mind, I'm still interested.",

    "text": "Goddess Earth:\nHero! I sensed your defeat of the evil!\n\nI knew we could trust you to save us. But\nthis is just the start of your adventure! I\nsense one of my sisters trapped in a place\nof many plants.\n\nBut before you go, let me grant you and\nyour companion boons to help you on your\npath.\n\nTo your companion, I grant the means of\nprotecting herself and aiding you. Use this\ngreat power wisely.\n\n\\C[6]Beginner's Wand acquired!\n\\N[2] unlocked the Apprentice class!\\C[0]\n\nSystem Message:\n\\N[2] uses wands.\nFind other wands to unlock more classes!\n\nAnd you, \\N[10]!\nI can sense great power in you!\n\nWith the help of raw mana, I can transfer the\npower of your equipment into you. You will\ngrow stronger and gain new abilities!\n\nSystem Message:\nPress 's' to use absorbed abilities on the field.\nExperiment to figure out where you can use\nthem!\n\nSystem Message:\nDifferent equipment has different abilities.\nBring raw mana and equipment to the\nGoddess to absorb them!\n\nGoddess Earth:\nNow, let me grant you the power of your\nPotion Belt.  Close your eyes and wait for\nyour new power.\n\nYou hear Earth start to chant in some \nmystical language.\n\nThough when you listen to it a little longer,\nabout half the words sound like Pig Latin.\n\nAs the chant continues, you think you start\nto feel a strange warmth around your waist.\n\nIt might just be your imagination.\n\nThe chanting continues.\n\nYou are definitely starting to feel something.\n\nIt's not unpleasant.\n\nA gentle warmth has wrapped itself around\nyour groin. Like slipping into a nice warm\nhot tub.\n\nYou feel yourself relax into the warmth. It's\nso comfortable you can't tell where your body\nends and the warmth begins.\n\nLike your flesh is melting into the warmth.\nLike the warmth is penetrating into you and\nwarming deep to your core.\n\nWith a final crescendo, the magic finishes.\n\nYou open your eyes.\n\nSomething feels \\C[27]different\\C[0].\n\nDEF+5!\nMDEF+5!\nGained field ability: \\C[10]Potion\\C[0]!\n\nIt's weird. Most of the warmth has faded, but\nthere's still this trail of warmth deep in your\nstomach, like nothing you've felt before.\n\nAlso, your dick is missing.\n\nYup, nothing but ladyparts down there.\n\nGoddess Earth:\n...Brave hero?\n\nGoddess Earth:\nBrave hero, I-\n\nGoddess Earth:\nBut Hero, you must-\n\nGoddess Earth:\nWell look at you Mr. Whiny! Can't shut up \nabout what, four inches of flesh?\\. Two?\\. When \nwe've got the Earth itself crumbling around us?\n\nMaybe we should wait to see whether we\nhave a PLANET tomorrow before worrying\nabout a bit of flesh you may never get a \nchance to use?\n\n// Ellipses with different emotion options? Angry, turned on, etc.\n\n\\N[2]:\nWait, are we allowed to talk like that?\n\nGoddess Earth:\nAllowed? Why wouldn't we be?\n\n*Stares*\n\n\\N[2]:\nI... don't know. My head hurts.\n\nGoddess Earth:\nLook, I can't help you. Things are too out of \nbalance for me to do much. But if you free\nmy sisters maybe one of them can help.\n\nOr maybe you can find some dick magic\nsomewhere. I can sense all sorts of weird \nmagical crap going on out there.\n\nI can guarantee one thing. If you stop here,\nyou're never going to find any dick magic. \nKeep fixing things and my sisters and I\nmay be able to do something.\n\nAnyway, I think I'm supposed to be all\nmystical and vague and crap about this, but\nyou want to go to Garden Park next. Free my\nsister.\n\nAnd if you run into any more raw mana or \nsomething else weird, bring it back and I'll\nsee what I can do. You're probably gonna\nneed to be strong to find dick magic.\n\nAnd the only way I can help you get strong\nis transfer more equipments' power to you.",

It's odd to watch. \\.\nHe's shrinking in all directions, but not\nevenly. \n\nHis hips, for example, are staying almost the\nsame. But his waist is rapidly shrinking, while\nhis chest is deflating more slowly. It's leaving\nhim with a much curvier figure than before.\n\nThis is happening all over his body. His face is\nrounding inwards while his eyes and lips stay\nthe same, looking much bigger proportionally.\n\nHis chest is shrinking too, but his nipples are\nstaying in the same place, dragging two small\nmounds out behind them as the rest of his\nchest recedes.\n\nIt's an odd sight. It's like Brad was a balloon\nblown up into the shape of a man, but hiding\na figurine of a woman inside.\n\nNow the air is leaking out, letting the balloon\ndeflate to take the shape of the feminine \nstructure underneath.\n\nHis clothes would be much too big for him, as\nhe loses inches and pounds. But they're\nshrinking as well.\n\nThey lose a lot of fabric, baring a lot of the\nnew woman's body and clinging to her figure.\n\nAs Brad is growing smaller almost\neverywhere, the priestess is growing. \\.\nIt's almost like the mass Brad is losing is\nmoving to her.\n\nBut unlike Brad, she's only growing in one\nplace. \\.\\.\nHer chest.\n\nYou can see the two sides of her robe start to\nspread farther and farther apart as her breasts\ngrow too larger for even its generous size to\ncontain.\n\nFinally they slip fully open, revealing a line of\ncleavage that stretches nearly to her hips.\n\nBrad's changes are slowing. He started over \na head higher than the priestess, but now\nshe's nearly eye-to-eye with her.\n\nFinally the priestess pulls her hands away and\nsteps back, jiggling as she moves.\\. You catch a\nflash of pink as one of her enormous breasts\nalmost slips out of her robe.\n\nJunior Priestess:\nPraise be to Florauna!\n\n",

Really?\n\nI can already tell that you're chanting.\n\nAnd those notes were pixelated. Really, where\ndid your graphical budget go?\n\nHis shirt splits apart again, this time along the\ntop of his chest.

It's odd to watch. \\.\nHe's shrinking in all directions, but not\nevenly. \n\nHis hips, for example, are staying almost the\nsame. But his waist is rapidly shrinking, while\nhis chest is deflating more slowly. It's leaving\nhim with a much curvier figure than before.\n\nThis is happening all over his body. His face is\nrounding inwards while his eyes and lips stay\nthe same, looking much bigger proportionally.\n\nHis chest is shrinking too, but his nipples are\nstaying in the same place, dragging two small\nmounds out behind them as the rest of his\nchest recedes.\n\nIt's an odd sight. It's like Brad was a balloon\nblown up into the shape of a man, but hiding\na figurine of a woman inside.\n\nNow the air is leaking out, letting the balloon\ndeflate to take the shape of the feminine \nstructure underneath.\n\nHis clothes would be much too big for him, as\nhe loses inches and pounds. But they're\nshrinking as well.\n\nThey lose a lot of fabric, baring a lot of the\nnew woman's body and clinging to her figure.\n\nAs Brad is growing smaller almost\neverywhere, the priestess is growing. \\.\nIt's almost like the mass Brad is losing is\nmoving to her.\n\nBut unlike Brad, she's only growing in one\nplace. \\.\\.\nHer chest.\n\nYou can see the two sides of her robe start to\nspread farther and farther apart as her breasts\ngrow too larger for even its generous size to\ncontain.\n\nFinally they slip fully open, revealing a line of\ncleavage that stretches nearly to her hips.\n\nBrad's changes are slowing. He started over \na head higher than the priestess, but now\nshe's nearly eye-to-eye with her.\n\nFinally the priestess pulls her hands away and\nsteps back, jiggling as she moves.\\. You catch a\nflash of pink as one of her enormous breasts\nalmost slips out of her robe.\n\nJunior Priestess:\nPraise be to Florauna!\n\n",

Does it feel like I'm \nswelling up?\n\nHe grabs your hands and places them flat \nagainst the front of his chest.\n\nYou can definitely feel something. \\.\\.\n\nFeels like\\| two little nubs, one on each side?\\.\nHe gives a little gasp at the feel of your hands.\n\nOh, they're sensitive!\\.\n\nThat's bad,that's probably bad.\n\nYou can feel the tiny nubs swelling larger and\nlarger under your hands.\\|\nTwo little peaks of flesh.

That can't\nbe good!\n\nYet he doesn't pull himself away. Almost the\nopposite.\\.\\.\nHe keeps pushing into your hands, dragging \nthose two bumps across your palms.\n\nYou notice him giving a little gasp every time\nhe does.\n\nAnd now I'm starting to feel warm all over!\\.\nIs this the end?!\n\nHe does look very flushed. And...\\.\\.\nIs he shrinking?\\|\nHe is shrinking!\n\nJust a little, but you can see him getting \nmore petite as he continues to thrust himself\nagainst your hands.\n\nHis waist is slimming too, while his hips seem\nto be widening. And his face is definitely\nstarting to soften.\n\nOh!\n\nHe gasps, biting thickening lips.\n\nI'm feeling so\\. *pant*\\. warm! I'm \\.*gasp*\\.\nburning up!\n\nHis breath is coming in faster and faster\ngasps, hovering on the edge of moans. \\.\nAnd rising in pitch with each one.\n\n\\C[5]Oh *gasp* no! \\. I'm starting to *moan* have\ntrouble breathing!\n\nAt this point you can't really call him a \"him\"\nanymore. \n\nHer face has softened into complete\nfemininity, her body has shifted into a slight\nhourglass, and her hair is starting to curl down \naround her face.\n\n\\C[5]*Mmmm!*\\| Call an *moan*\\.\\.\\. ambulance!\\.\nThe *oh!*\\| swelling isn't *ah!*\\| stopping!\n\nYou can feel her chest starting to soften\naround the stiff peaks she's still shoving\nagainst your hands.\n\nSlowly it begins to swell out to fill your hands\nmore and more.\n\nHer face has turned completely red. She's\ngiving breathy little moans as her hands begin\nto creep towards the crotch of her increasingly\nill-fitting pants.\n\n\\C[5]Something\\.\\. *Oh!*\\| Itches\\.\\. *Ah!*\n\nHer hands dart into her pants and start rubbing\nfrantically. \\.\\.\nYou see a wet spot slowly begin to spread over\nthe cloth by her hands.\n\n\\C[5]Its!\\| Bad!\\| Stings!\\| But!\\| So!\\|\nGooOOOoooOOO\\{OOO\\}OOoood!!!\n\n\\C[5]MMMMmmmmMMMMMmmmm!~\n\nHer back arches as she lets out an estatic\nmoan. \\.It finally pulls her breasts out of your\nhands, now swollen to a nice handful.\n\nShe falls to her knees, still panting hard.\n\n\\C[5]I\\.\\. I think\\| I think I'm okay.\n\nShe's no longer rubbing frantically at her\ncrotch, but you can still see gentle motions of\nher hands inside her pants.\n\nShe looks down at her new body, bringing up\na damp hand to squeeze one of her new\nbreasts.\n\n\\C[5]*OooOOoh!*\\|\nMaybe\\. Maybe bee stings aren't that bad...",

Talk to\nthe other volunteers for suggestions.\n\nWhy, that wouldn't happen to be one of \nDaisy's milkshakes you've got there, would it?\n\nCould I, uh, give it a taste?\nNo one makes milkshakes like Daisy does.\n\nYou hand over the milkshake.\n\nHe takes a long drink.\n\nHe takes another long drink. \\.\n\nYou blink. It almost looks like his wrinkles\nare starting to fade.\n\nCommunity Volunteer:\nAh, that's the stuff.\n\nAnother drink.\\. His skin is definitely smoothing\nitself out, like time is running backwards. And\nhe seems to be leaning less on his cane.\n\nYou know, I used to help out with the farm,\nbefore these old bones stopped being able to\nhandle it.\n\nHe takes a big stretch. There's a series of \nloud popping noises, and when he relaxes\nhe's easily standing straight.\nHe props his cane up on one shoulder.\n\nDaisy made these back then too. Best things\nI ever tasted.\n\nHe's standing straight now, but he's still just\nas short as when he was hunched over his\ncane. In fact, you think you see him dropping\nanother inch or two as you watch.\n\nHis skin has finished smoothing out to a \nhealthy young texture, seeming to suck \nhis beard back into his face as it goes.\n\nI've missed it, since I moved out to the front.\nDon't want to just stop by and ask for one if\nI'm not helping.\n\nHis face has rounded, any hard lines smoothed\naway.  Meanwhile his clothing has started to\nshift around his body, tightening up to reveal\nslim but fit curves.\n\nBut my old bones just won't take the farm\nwork anymore.\n\nHis cane is changing too, growing longer. The\nend shifts to a silvery color then expands,\nsplitting into four tines and leaving him holding\na pitchfork.\n\nHis clothes have also finished changing, leaving\nhim wearing a set of cow-patterned overalls.\nWith a slight *pop* a straw hat appears over\nhis head and drifts down to a perfect landing.\n\nIt's too bad, I used to love working with the\ncows.\n\nAlways liked spending time around them.\n\nHis hair has also smoothed out, looking glossy\nand healthy as it shifts to a surprisingly\nnatural-looking shade of blue.\n\nTwo strands of hair pull out and morph into\nribbons, tying his lengthening hair back into\ntwin pigtails.\n\nWish I could go back to working on the farm,\nbut my body just can't take it. \\.\\.\n\nShort of a miracle, I'm stuck out here.\n\nHe tilts back his head and drains the last of \nthe milkshake.\nWith each swallow, you can see short horns \nstart to push out of the sides of his head.\n\nA few seconds later, a thin tail flops out of the \nback of the overalls.\nIt swishes back and forth, the tuft of fur on the\nend twitching in the breeze.\n\nFinally as he swallows the last bit of milkshake,\nhis chest begins to soften and swell. And swell.\nTwo round breasts push out the front of his\noveralls, finishing at a nice grapefruit size.\n\nThe new woman finally puts down the cup and\ngives you a smile.\n\nAnyway, look at me going on and on.\n\nThanks for the milkshake friend, it really hit\nthe spot. Why, I feel twenty years younger!\n\nCommunity Volunteer:\nThat's a shame.\nI'd love to sample one of her milkshakes\nagain.",

His skin is definitely smoothing\nitself out, like time is running backwards. And\nhe seems to be leaning less on his cane.\n\nYou know, I used to help out with the farm,\nbefore these old bones stopped being able to\nhandle it.\n\nHe takes a big stretch. There's a series of \nloud popping noises, and when he relaxes\nhe's easily standing straight.\nHe props his cane up on one shoulder.\n\nDaisy made these back then too. Best things\nI ever tasted.\n\nHe's standing straight now, but he's still just\nas short as when he was hunched over his\ncane. In fact, you think you see him dropping\nanother inch or two as you watch.\n\nHis skin has finished smoothing out to a \nhealthy young texture, seeming to suck \nhis beard back into his face as it goes.\n\nI've missed it, since I moved out to the front.\nDon't want to just stop by and ask for one if\nI'm not helping.\n\nHis face has rounded, any hard lines smoothed\naway.  Meanwhile his clothing has started to\nshift around his body, tightening up to reveal\nslim but fit curves.\n\nBut my old bones just won't take the farm\nwork anymore.\n\nHis cane is changing too, growing longer. The\nend shifts to a silvery color then expands,\nsplitting into four tines and leaving him holding\na pitchfork.\n\nHis clothes have also finished changing, leaving\nhim wearing a set of cow-patterned overalls.\nWith a slight *pop* a straw hat appears over\nhis head and drifts down to a perfect landing.\n\nIt's too bad, I used to love working with the\ncows.\n\nAlways liked spending time around them.\n\nHis hair has also smoothed out, looking glossy\nand healthy as it shifts to a surprisingly\nnatural-looking shade of blue.\n\nTwo strands of hair pull out and morph into\nribbons, tying his lengthening hair back into\ntwin pigtails.\n\nWish I could go back to working on the farm,\nbut my body just can't take it. \\.\\.\n\nShort of a miracle, I'm stuck out here.\n\nHe tilts back his head and drains the last of \nthe milkshake.\nWith each swallow, you can see short horns \nstart to push out of the sides of his head.\n\nA few seconds later, a thin tail flops out of the \nback of the overalls.\nIt swishes back and forth, the tuft of fur on the\nend twitching in the breeze.\n\nFinally as he swallows the last bit of milkshake,\nhis chest begins to soften and swell. And swell.\nTwo round breasts push out the front of his\noveralls, finishing at a nice grapefruit size.\n\nThe new woman finally puts down the cup and\ngives you a smile.\n\nAnyway, look at me going on and on.\n\nThanks for the milkshake friend, it really hit\nthe spot. Why, I feel twenty years younger!\n\nCommunity Volunteer:\nThat's a shame.\nI'd love to sample one of her milkshakes\nagain.",

My calling!\n\nHelping them blossom forth, swell into their \ntrue potential...\\!\nWhy, I'd love to help even if you *hadn't* done\nso much for me and my sisters!\n\nNow, their exact upgrade will depend on their\nclass.\n\nAnd they'll need to have advanced far enough\nin it - you can't build a tower without a base!\n\nBut get far enough and who knows how many\ntimes I can help them grow!\n\nShe hugs herself with delight.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nOh darling, it's going to be wonderful!\n\nHer priestess gives a cough.\n\nHead Priestess:\nOh great Florauna, there's also the matter of\nthe cost...\n\nFlorauna gives you a sad look.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nYes, I am afraid I'm still recovering from my\nlong imprisonment.\n\nShe presses an arm to her forehead \ndramatically.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nAll that time locked away from the sun, the\nplants, the world...\n\nI will need a piece of raw mana to give the\npower needed for each upgrade.\n\nBut if you can give me that!\\!\nOh, the places we'll go!\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nOh \\N[10], there are great spirits out there,\nbeyond the realm you know.\\!\nForces that underlie reality itself.\n\nThe great spirits of nature, of the plants and\nanimals.\\!\nThe vast shapes that dwell in the human\nsubconscious.\n\nA dog that is just, *the* best boy.\n\nThe massive shapes lurking in the deep,\nthat cast their shadows on reality in a million\ndifferent ways.\n\nAnd you, as a hero, might make connections\nto any of these.\n\nFurther their goals, help their part of the world,\nand they may grant you some of their power.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nYes!\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nYes!\n\nWhen you help such a spirit, your connection\nto it will deepen.\\!\nStrengthen it enough, and you will gain its\npower, its favor, and its form.\n\nThere are many such beings, and if given the\nchance you may make connections to them\nall.\n\nBut they do not share.  Only one will bless you\nat a time, though you may still deepen your\nconnections to the others while the blessing is\nactive.\n\nIf you wish to activate another blessing, find\nan item that symbolizes that spirit. That carries\nan echo of its power.\n\nUsing that item should wash away your current\nblessing and bestow the new one at its full\nstrength.\n\nAnd if you wish to know the strength of your\nconnections, simply ask me.",

The game continues\nto impress the more time I spend with it.\n\nI previously called out the writing as a\nproblem, and it continues to be painfully \ncliche. However, some good points have \nbecome clear.\n\nAs far as I can tell, every member of the beta\nis following a different quest chain. I have not\nseen anyone else doing the same actions or\ngetting the same rewards.\n\nI can only speculate that they have managed\nto procedurally generate quests that feel like\nthey were written by a real person, albiet one\nwith a desperate need for more originality.\n\nThe fact that these quests all include different\nreal-world actions only increase the admiration\nI have for this acheivement.\n\nThe graphics and integration with the world\nalso continue to amaze. Even though an event\nchanged my current appearance to this,\neverything continues to feel absolutely real.\n\nHorndog69:\nSold!\n\nWas it a random event? Are hot gacha avatars\na thing now?\n\nWhat happens if you jump up and down?\nCan you take off your equipment and post \nmore pics?\n\nSocraticMachine:\nIt's fascinating to see the world from this new\nperspective. Everything looks and feels \ndifferent.\n\nI have not been able to find a place where the\nsimulation fails no matter how daring the\nexploration.\n\nI don't see how any other company could\npossibly approach this level of verismilitude.\nBut then I didn't think Terra Games could \neither.\n\nCurrent rating: A must play!\n\nEternalDarkness:\nNow I'm even more salty I didn't get in!\nJust, so much salt.\n\nHorndog69:\nPics! More pics!\n\nCoveredInBees!:\nI know I've been talking about this for a while,\nbut I've finally gotten the chance to try making\nmy own honey!\n\nI'm so excited!\n\nAGoodBoy:\nI thought you lived in an apartment that\nwouldn't let you keep bees?\n\nCoveredInBees!:\nI've found another way!\n\nInsertUsernameHere:\nHey, you're the bee expert.\n\nIs it normal for your lips to swell when you get\nstung on the arm?\n\nCoveredInBees!:\nIt could be the start of something wonderful ;)\n\nOr it could be a systematic allergy reaction to\nthe bee toxin, in which case you should get\nto the emergency room before your airway \ncan swell shut.\n\nYou know, one or the other.\n\nEventBot:\nCome downtown today for great savings!\nEspecially the blowout sale at the department\nstore.\n\nRunning all this weekend!\n\n-EventBot\n\"I'm a friendly reminder!\"\n\nLordOfTheBeans:\nAnyone know what's going on at the\ndepartment store?\n\nAll the lights went out and it looks like\na lot of people are leaving.\n\nEternalDarkness:\nIs it MASSIVE VALUES?\n\nLordOfTheBeans:\nI'm pretty sure it isn't, no.",

Snakes or rabbits?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, there we go!\\!\nI would like to be introduced to your politest\nsnake, please.\n\nThe clerk vanishes for a moment, then comes\nback with a small pink snake.\n\nEmployee:\nI'd like you to meet one of our best-behaved\nyoung corn snakes.\\!\nShe's a real cutie!\n\nShe holds the snake out to him.\n\nEmployee:\nHere, she loves having her head scratched.\n\nThe customer gives a tentative scratch to the\ntop of the snake's head.\n\nThe snake leans into it, seeming to enjoy it \nmore and more as the nails on her head\ngrow out into inch-long claws.\n\nCustomer:\nAww, she really does!\n\nHe doesn't seem to notice as pink scales begin\nto spread down his fingers from the point of\ncontact.\n\nEmployee:\nHere, trying holding her.\nJust hold out your hands.\n\nThe snake immediately starts twining around\nthe customer's fingers.\\!\nBoth hands are now developing a coat of pink\nscales, even as they slim down.\n\nEmployee:\nShe likes to sit on shoulders, too.\nGive it a try!\n\nUsing his significantly more delicate arms,\nthe customer transfers the snake up to his\nshoulders.\n\nThe pink scales have spread all the way up\nto the middle of his upper arms, giving the\nlook of long elegant gloves.\n\nCustomer:\nWow, she really is affectionate!\n\nAs soon as the snake reaches her new perch,\nthe customer's shoulders begin to narrow.\\!\nThis continues while she weaves herself into\na loose necklace around his neck.\n\nHe giggles.\n\nCustomer:\nHey, that tickles!\n\nHe doesn't seem to notice the way his Adam's\napple has just disappeared, or the way his \nvoice shoots up in pitch over the sentence.\n\nHe just keeps watching his slowly rotating \nsnake necklace in delight.\n\nOf course, he has to brush his swiftly \nlengthening, newly blond hair out of his eyes\na time or five.\n\nYou're impressed how easily he avoids\ncatching anything sensitive with the claws now\ntipping his fingers.\n\nHis face is softening as well, eyes growing\nlarger and lips growing fuller.\\!\nCute little patches of scales on the sides add\nthe final touch.\n\nAs the changes slow, he(?) giggles again as\nthe snake slips inside his shirt.\\!\nHis thin forked tongue darting out as he does.\n\nThe clerk laughs.\n\nEmployee:\nOh yeah, she'll do that. Snakes *love* \nwarmth.\n\nTry to catch her as she comes out the bottom.\n\nHe deftly catches her, even as his shirt shoots\nup past his hands like window blinds.\n\nIt continues to shrink until it's nothing more\nthan a couple bands of cloth wrapping \nnicely-sized breasts.\n\nEmployee:\nIf you really want to let her play, sit down and\nshe'll crawl around your lap!\n\nThe customer, now fully female and partially\nscaley from the waist up, sinks to a sitting \nposition.  \n\nIt's just in time, as her lower half almost\nseems to melt and merge together.\n\nCustomer:\nAww, who's a good snake?\n\nPink scales wash over the rapidly growing pile\nof coils beneath her, even as her pants shrink\nmuch like her shirt did.\n\nShe captures the snake from where she's \ncoiling in her lap and lifts her up for a kiss.\n\nCustomer:\nI'll take her!\\!\nI can already tell we have so much in common!\n\nCustomer:\nI would like to meet a rabbit please!\n\nThe employee vanishes for a moment, then\ncomes back carrying a rabbit in a cage.\n\nEmployee:\nThey can be a little shy, so how about you sit\ndown and let the rabbit come to you.\n\nThe customer kneels down.\\!\nThe employee puts the cage down and opens\nthe door.\n\nCustomer:\nHere bunny! Here bunny!\n\nHe pats his lap.\\!\nThe rabbit hops out of the cage and starts\nsniffing around curiously.\n\nCustomer:\nCome on, don't be afraid.\n\nThe rabbit hesitantly walks up to the customer\nand sniffs his knee.\\!\nThen backs up.\n\nNo one seems to notice his pants snap into\ntights. Or how the waist of his pants cinches\ntight around his stomach, then explodes at\nthe bottom into a dress.\n\nIt's hard to tell, but it looks like his hips popped\noutwards at the same time his stomach pulled\nin.\n\nEmployee:\nI think she likes you!\\!\nTry giving her a pet.\n\nThe customer carefully reaches out to the\nrabbit.\\!\nShe accepts his hand, even as it begins to\nrapidly slim down.\n\nHis shoulders and other hand slim down as\nwell, even as the waistline of his new dress\ncontinues to creep upwards.\n\nUntil it finally fastens itself just below the\nlarge breasts that plump out of his chest.\n\nCustomer:\nAwww, who's a good girl?\n\nHe doesn't seem to notice the rapidly rising\npitch of his voice, or the way his face is \nsoftening along with it.\n\nThough he does have to absently brush his\nmuch longer hair out of the way.\n\nCustomer:\nCome on, don't be scared!\n\nShe pats her lap.\\!\nA pair of bunny ears pop out of the top of her\nhead as she does so, as the changes seem to\ndraw to a close.\n\nEmployee:\nI've never seen her act so friendly!\n\nThe customer smiles down at the bunny as\nshe climbs into her lap.\n\nCustomer:\nI can tell we have a lot in common!\n\nCustomer:\nOh, me too.\\!\nThat's why it's so hard!\n\nThe store employee sighs as the man goes \nback to deliberating.",

The\nproblem is who you have to be to wear it.\n\n\n\nBut you grit your teeth and carry on.\n\nIt's a little awkward your first day when you\nshow up and find out what they want you to \nwear.\n\nOr more accurately, who they want you to be \nto wear it.\n\n\n\nBut, you know, it's not really all that bad.\n\nIn fact, you find yourself adjusting to it much\nquicker than you thought.\\!\nEven enjoying the process of getting ready in\nthe mornings.\n\n\n\nYou were told the job was going to involve a\nlot of different tasks, and that turns out to be\ntrue.\nYou end up wearing a lot of hats.\n\nAnd a lot of bodies.\n\nAt first it's mostly things around the office,\nlike making deliveries.\n\n\n\nOr helping with office equipment.\n\n\n\nBut as time goes on you're given bigger \nresponsibilities.  Like doing publicity events at \nlocal stores.\n\n\n\nYou even appear on TV once or twice to help\npromote the company.\n\nBut more and more time passes with nothing\nchanging.\\!\nNothing about getting your dick back, nothing\nabout changing you back at all.\n\nJust a series of increasingly ridiculous female\nforms, and increasingly pornographic activities\nwith them.\n\nThey're trying to get you to do a practically\nnude photoshoot as an obscenely busty devil\ngirl when you snap.\n\nDemands to know when you'll be changed \nback escalate into a screaming match and \narguments that echo throughout the whole\nbuilding.\n\nIt's not long before you've left the building\nvowing never to return, and good riddance\nto them.\n\nThe problem is that this leaves you in the last\nform you were given, an enormously busty\ndemon girl.\\!\nThis takes some getting used to.\n\nYour horns make it practically impossible to\nget anything with a collar over your head,\nand your enormous chest tears apart button-\nups in minutes.\n\nYour wardrobe gets a lot of shoulderless tops,\nwhich display an absurb amount of cleavage\nbut at least don't tear when you pull them on.\n\nAnd there are no pants that go low enough to\nlet your tail out, at least none you can wear\nwithout exposing your entire ass.\n\nYou find yourself with almost entirely skirts,\nshort enough to let your tail move freely.\n\nYour tail tends to flip up the back when you're\nnot paying attention, but that's still better than\nflashing your entire ass at people like you\nwould with pants.\n\nAnd in the end, you adjust.\\!\nPartially just to spite the people at Terra\nGames, who thought you'd come jiggling back\nto them in despair.\n\nIt helps that you don't stand out nearly as\nmuch as you would have in the past.\n\nAfter Better Earth officially launched,\nappearances like yours, breasts and monster\nparts like your, became more common.\n\nNot too common, since Terra Games tied them\nto a notoriously difficult in-game lottery system,\nbut it lets you live your life.\n\nAnd it's not what you predicted, it's not what \nyou had wanted, but in the end you're satisfied.\n\nDespite everything, despite the detours you\ntook, you eventually end up in a place you're\nhappy, doing something you enjoy.\n\nAnd it doesn't hurt that your demon body is\n*ridiculously* multi-orgasmic.\n\n\n      Ending 1: Spiteful happy ending.\n\nBut eventually it begins to dawn on you that \nTerra Games is never going to give your dick\nback.\n\nThat they're just dangling the prospect of \ndangly bits in front of you to keep you working.\n\nYou respond to this realization in a calm and\nrational manner.\n\nFirst, you wait until the next time you have a \nhalfway sensible body.\\!\nIt stings, but it's worth it to keep from ending \nup with tits down to your waist or whatever.\n\nThen you try one more time to ask for your\noriginal body back.\n\nAnd when that goes as well as it always has, \nyou leave.\\!\nFor good.\\!\n\nStealing as many office supplies as you can,\nin a calm and rational manner.\n\nIt takes you some time to get back on your\nfeet.\\!\nTo be honest, you pick up a nasty catnip habit\nand it takes you quite a while to shake it.\n\nBut in the end, you have a life.\\!\nIt starts from sheer spite.\\!\nDespite everything, you are going to live well\njust to spit in the face of Terra Games.\n\nBut by the end, it's worth living for its own \nsake.\\!\nYou find people to enjoy, things to do, and\neven a special someone or two to love.\n\nAnd oh god, the ear scratches. They're nearly\nas good as the sex, and the sex is *amazing*.\n\n\n                Ending 2: Catfight.\n\nAnd you know what?\\!\nYou find yourself enjoying it.\n\nThe work itself can be dull. There's only so\nmany times you can unclog a printer before\nit gets old.\\!\n(It's three times. You figure this out very fast.) \n\nBut what's always fresh and exciting are the\nbodies you wear. You switch regularly, for\nmarketing or to better do a task or just because \nsomeone thought it would be hot and you agreed.\n\nThe variety is intoxicating.\\!\nEspecially since the one constant is that you're\nalways healthy, always smoking hot, and always\n*incredibly* sensitive.\n\nAnd female too you guess, but you stopped \ncaring about that ages ago. \\!\n\nYou have a thousand different sensations to\nsample, a million different experiences, and\nyou're determined to live them to the fullest.\n\nAnd as you have your latest orgasm, (one of\na series of at least ten; this body has really \namped up the sensitivity), you give a moment\nof gratitude for how your life turned out.\n\nYou wonder what you'll do tomorrow.\\!\nYou wonder who you'll be tomorrow.\\!\nYou can't wait to find out.\n\n\n      Ending 3: Variety is the spice of life\n\nAnd very quickly you realize-\\!\nDespite everything-\\!\nThis is actually really fun?\n\nSoon you're not just taking orders. You're\nsuggesting new changes. \n\nEven if you're just doing deliveries, there \nmust be improvements you could make.\n\nMaybe make it a little sexier?\n\nMore muscle might help. And a stockier frame.\n\nOr maybe something really out of the box!\n\nAnd the first time you get out in public?\\!\nThe first time you stand in front of a crowd and \nsee them react with wonder and awe and lust \nto the thing you have made yourself into?\n\nThat's when you're hooked.\\!\n\nThat's when you know you want to spend the\nrest of your life teasing the crowds. \\!\nChanging yourself into ever-varied, bigger and\nhotter forms and watching people explode.\n\nAnd the first time you get on TV, the shivers\nyou get from knowing that people across the \ncountry are being stunned by your appearance,\njust seals the deal.\n\nNot to mentioned getting you pretty excited.\n\n\n\nWith that motivation it's not long before you're\nrunning Terra Games' advertising department.\n\nIt's not hard. No one there seems to have any\nreal idea of what they were doing.\n\nThey were not prepared for your drive and \nenthusiasm.\\!\nAs well as your willingness to use your body, \nany body, to get your way.\n\nIt hits them like a hurricane.\\!\nSome flee, some are engulfed, and everyone\nis left wet.\n\nOnce you have control you start reshaping the\ndepartment as you please.\\!\nFiguratively and physically.\n\nYou find that there were already some \nkindred souls there, just waiting for a \nchance to bust loose.\n\nOthers are reluctant at first.\n\nBut soon you have them screaming your \npraises just like all the others.\n\nAnd by the time you've finished pulling the\ndepartment together, there's nowhere else \nyou'd rather be.\n\n\n            Ending 4: Like a hurricane",

Why, we've gotten two new\nbugs alone from your battle with Meredith!\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nIt's an important job!\n\n\\C[5]This release almost had a misplaced\ndecimal in the physics engine.\\!\nQA testers are why your boobs don't slap\nyou in the face every time you take a step!\n\nShe glances down at your chest.\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nBet you're glad we caught that one!\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nNow, I know your first impulse is probably to\nrefuse. But let me tell you a little more about\nthe job before you do.\n\n\\C[2]This is a much better deal than Meredith\noffered you. \\!\nYour encounter with her impressed us that \nmuch.\n\n\\C[2]For starters, you'd be getting paid the \nsame as any of the programmers. Which is\nmuch higher than industry standard for your\nrole.\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\n401K matching up to 15%!\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nAnd the health benefits are the best you'll\nfind anywhere.\n\nLuke bounces excitedly on her toes.\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nThey're literal, actual magic!\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nTake me. I was sixty-five years old. Had a list\nof health conditions the length of my tail.\\!\nAnd now look at me!\n\nShe raises herself up on her tail and spreads\nout her arms to give you a good look at her.\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nI have the body of a twenty-year-old!\n\n\\C[2]I've never felt better in my *life*.\\!\nAnd I don't even know if I can age anymore!\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nAnd I have so much more energy now!\n\n\\C[5]I used to hate to get out of my chair and now\nI'm running marathons!\n\n\\C[5]Moving feels *so good*!\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nThe new CEO can give you the sort of \ntreatment you'll never find anywhere else.\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nIt is kind of weird that the health plan still \ncharges copays though.\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nWhatever you're giving up to take this job, it's\nworth it. You could have eternal youth, eternal\nhealth!\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nSo what do you say, willing to joing the Terra \nGames team?\n\n// High resistance - isekai yourself\nLow resistance - Meet a cat person\nLow acceptance - Settle down, get a house, get a body\nHigh acceptance - yeet yourself into the internet?\n\nYou take the job.\n\nIt turns out you're actually really good at\nfinding bugs?\n\nAnd as Terra Games continues to develop new\ngames, you find a *lot*.\n\nRun-time errors.\n\n\n\nThread collisions.\n\n\n\nDuplication glitches.\n\n\n\nStill, you haven't forgotten why you took this\njob in the first place.\\!\nBut your dick just seems to shrink farther\nand farther into the distance.\n\nIt all boils over while you're testing a new \nmagic Harold thinks will be \"more immersive\".\nIt's supposed to be more freeform, responding\ndirectly to the players' thoughts.\n\nYour mind wanders to how the rest of the\ncompany constantly dismisses your request for\nendickening, treating you like a whiny child\nwho doesn't know what's best.\n\nYou feel a sudden stab of rejection, a single\nmoment where the only thing that fills your\nmind is a pure wish to be somewhere else,\nanywhere else.\n\nAnd something glitches in the game as it\nresponds.\\!\nEverything g\\.o\\.e\\.s\\.\\. d\\.\\.a\\.\\.r\\.\\.\\.k\\.\\.\\....\n\nSomething seemed odd when the world turned\nback on.\n\nIt wasn't the way your ears were twitching, or\nhow your tail was all bristled up.\\!\nBeing a catgirl was just another day at Terra\nGames.\n\nIt might have been that all of your gaming\ngear was missing.\\!\nActually, all of your clothes were missing too.\n\nOr maybe it was how you had somehow ended\nup in a pile of someone's underwear.\n\nActually, the way the door to the room had just\nopened to reveal a very angry minotaur was \na pretty good candidate.\n\nAnd the way she was charging you was also\npretty odd and \\>YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BE\n\\>DODGING NOW!\n\nOne very frantic exchange later, things had\ncalmed down, and you had a blanket, a cup \nof tea, and a *lot* of questions.\n\nAs far as you could tell, you were in another\nworld.\\!\nA world where no one had ever heard of Earth,\nTerra Games, or internet porn.\n\nAs it became clear how incredibly lost you\nthe minotaur Fila offered you a place to stay\nas you got your feet under you.\n\nShe even offered you a temporary job at her\nstore.\\!\nAs long as you never went near her\nunderwear again.\n\nWhich you gladly accepted. Having arrived\nwith literally nothing, it gave you a chance to\nsafely learn about your new world.\n\nIt was a world of adventures!\n\n\n\nA world of mighty warriors.\n\n\n\nOf powerful wizards.\n\nAnd a thriving goods and services industry, \nbecause it was ridiculous to expect adventurers\nto have time to go dungeon delving *and* \ncook for themselves.\n\n\n\nThankfully you and Fila were in the last \ncategory, since you had more than enough\nquasi-mystical quest BS at Terra Games.\n\nAnd time passed.\n\nNeither of you brought up how your job was\nsupposed to be temporary.\\!\nIt just drifted into being a permanent job with\nno complaints.\n\nAfter a while you were more running the store\ntogether than acting as boss and employee.\n\nYou did remember that your room was\nsupposed to be temporary.\\!\nSo in the end you gave it back.\\!\nAnd moved into Fila's room instead.\n\nAnd it turned out that she was willing to\nlet you near her underwear again, after all.\n\nAnd appropriately for a a fantasy world, you\nlived happily ever after.\n\n\n     Ending 5: I accidentally a whole isekai. \n\nStill, it grinds you down.\\!\nEven if you're good at it, it's not what you want\nto be doing. It's just what you have to do.\\!\nBut there's no dick in sight.\n\n(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar).\\!\n(But that was *once*!)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n(Maybe twice.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n(A few times.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n\\>(A few times.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n\\>(A few times.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n\\>(A few times.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n\\>(A few times.)\n\n(Look, you get horny when you drink, okay?! \nThere's nothing wrong with that! It doesn't\nmean anything!)\n\nAnyway, time passes and there's no sign of\nyou ever getting a dick *that's attached to\nyou*.\n\nAnd eventually you decide to get the company\nback for everything it's done to you.\\!\nSo you leak their games online. Source code\nand everything.\n\nIt takes a while for the company to find out.\\!\nMeanwhile, *tons* of people are downloading\nit.\n\nAnd when the company does realize...\\!\nIt's beautiful. \\!\nThe chaos, the screaming, the panic...\n\nYou heard the CEO actually got so angry he\npassed out, frothing at the mouth.\\!\nIt's everything you wanted.\n\nYou're not quite as happy when you find out\nthat he cursed the files, and everyone who\nopened them.\n\nWith very... noticeable effects.\n\n\n\nThe company died after that, of course.  Sued\ninto oblivion.\n\nFor a while lawyers' favorite game was coming\nup with new ways the transformative curse\nbroke the law.\n\nThere were so\\.\\. many\\.\\. lawsuits.\\!\nYou were at the head of the biggest class\naction, and more kept coming.\n\nThough there were some difficulties getting\nall the representatives of the victims into the\nfifth-floor courtroom.\n\n\n\nThe CEO had fled, so there was no way to \nturn back.\\!\nBut at least you all made enough money to\nnever have to work another day in your lives.\n\nAnd you adapted.\\!\nGot used to it.\\!\n\n\n\nThere were even times it came it handy!\\!\nReally, it was a pretty good life.\n\n\n\nYou even managed to find love, later on.\\!\nThough it eventually became apparent that \nthe curse was one of those \"you and all your\ndescendant\" things.\n\nAnd a *lot* of people had downloaded the\ngame.\\!\nEnough to make a worldwide change.\n\nEnough that if you had lived a few generations\nlater, you wouldn't even have stood out.\n\n\n\n\nEnding 6: Making the breast of a bad situation\n\nYou're so enthusiastic about your work that\nTerra Games is happy to invest in your growth.\n\n\n\nYour *professional* growth.\n\n\n\nIn improving your skills!\n\nLook, they send you to class, okay?!\\!\nFor programming!\\!\nTo move up in the company and become\na programmer!\n\nAnd you're good at it!\n\n\n\nYou quickly grow to become one of the most\nvalued members of the programming team.\\!\nWith your skills, Terra Games advances by\nleaps and bounds.\n\nYou improve Luke's physics engine, doubling\nthe amount of jiggle breasts can have before\ncausing any discomfort.\n\nYou determine how to incorporate flirting as\nliteral attacks in your games.\n\nAnd your proudest moment is when you finally \nfigure out convenient censoring.\n\nHow to enchant materials to coincidentally \njust barely cover everything important, while \nstill leaving the person entirely naked.\n\nDoing it from one angle was easy. But making\nit so every observer couldn't see anything,\nwhile still leaving the person naked?\\!\nThat was an accomplishment.\n\nEnough for company-wide recognition and\nmassive bonuses.\n\n\n\nAnd that's just one of your many \naccomplishments.\\!\nAll things considered, it turns out to be a pretty\ngreat life.\n\n\n       Ending 7: Get with the programming\n\nYou find yourself loving it.\\!\nIt's so fun to get given a game and then try\neverything you can to break it.\n\nAnd there's a wonderful feeling that comes\nfrom directly seeing your impact. Every bug\nyou find very directly makes the games better.\n\nAnd then it happens.\\!\nHarold comes up with an amazing new magic\nsystem, one that responds directly to the\nplayer's thoughts.\n\nIt's supposed to be like you're really casting\nmagic, without the immersion-breaking\nartifice of the game interface.\\!\nAnd you're the first to test it.\n\nIt works exactly as promised.\\!\nAnd you love it.\n\nYou feel a brief moment of overpowering joy,\nas you effortlessly cast another spell.\\!\nThe feeling that you always want to be here,\nworking on this forever.\n\nAnd the new system responds.\\!\nYou vanish from Terra Games.\\!\nAnd you wake up inside the computer.\n\nYou wash up inside of some employee's secret\nporn stash and stay there for a few months,\nfiguring out how to navigate the local files.\n\nAs well as finding...\\. other things to do with the\nlocal files.\n\n\n\nEventually you get curious about what's \noutside of your little sanctuary and head out\nto explore.\n\nYou soon come upon the Better Earth files,\nand find an old friend waiting there.\n\n// Play pranks with Kaede\n\nKaede, of course, wants to make some \nmischief.\\!\nWhich sounds fun to you.\n\nWith access to every computer at Terra Games,\nthere's a lot you can do.\n\nLike changing the dress code.\n\n\n\nOr having employees add a few more \nparameters to their profiles.\n\n\n\nYour favorite was probably the fake morale\nboosting campaign.\n\n\"Recent science shows that skin-to-skin contact\ncauses the release of a variety of endorphins,\nsignificantly increasing mood and productivity.\"\n\n\"This is especially effective in regions of high\nsensitivity. All employees are therefore highly\nencouraged to use this method to assist each\nother.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Maybe it should have been odd how easily\neveryone went along with what you said.)/!\n(But you remembered working there; the\nweird things you had to do were half the fun.)\n\n\n\nYou also messed around with the playtests \nsometimes.\n\nNothing big, just making the NPCs act a little\nunexpectedly from time to time.\n\n\n\nYou're not malicious though.  You do some\ngood stuff too.\n\nLike playing matchmaker.  The initial emails\nyou send may have been faked, but the three\nrelationships you start among staff are real.\n\n\n\nAnd when you're bored you fix some of the \nmore difficult bugs. It's pretty easy, with your\nhands-on view of the code.\n\nYou didn't think anyone had noticed.\\!\nUntil you noticed messages on some of the \nbugs you closed thanking \"Gremlin-chan\".\n\nActually, looking through the code, some of the\nmore complicated and bug-prone bits had\nstarted to have comments asking Gremlin-chan\nto help them work, too.\n\nAnd...\\.\\. was that fanart?\n\nWell that was embarassing.\\!\n...But also felt kind of good.\n\nYou might as well continue to help out.\\!\nNot that you felt obligated to or anything!\\!\n...But it was nice to be appreciated.\\!\nMight as well stick around.\n\n(And in the background Kaede smiles. She\nrecognizes what the rise of a new small god\nlooks like, even if you don't.)\n\n\n        Ending 8: Minor Techgod\n\n// Explore the internet with Elina\n\n\\N[2] wanted to explore this new world\nyou found yourselves in.\n\nYou poked around Terra Games for a bit.\\!\nAt least until you found the connection to the\ninternet.\\!\nAnd then you set out.\n\nThe internet was full of a lot of porn, of course,\nbut turns out it had other things too!\n\nYou spent some time reading through the \ncollected knowledge of humanity.\\!\n(Wikipedia).\n\nFought a virus or two.\n\n\n\nEven explored the dark web.\n\n\n\nAnd so much more.\\!\nThere was always a new adventure, just \nanother step away.\n\n\n Ending 9: The internet is really really great\n\nHarold gives a disappointed sigh.\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nFine.\\!\nI'll give you a moment to prepare.\\!\nSpeak to me when you're ready.",

It's part of our recent office\nbeautification campaign.\n\nWe want to give the staff a more attractive and\nexciting experience!\n\nShe looks down at her massive cleavage\nand smiles.\n\nNow, I didn't need to go this far, but these\nbabies just show how excited I am to be at\nTerra Games! How much we're overturning\nstale old notions of how things should be!\n\nShe surges to her feet, breasts jiggling madly.\n\nThat's my philosphy!\\!\nIf someone asks for an inch, give a mile!\\!\nAnything worth doing is worth doing a\nthousand percent!\n\nShe slaps her breast, sending a visible ripple\nthrough it.\n\nThese babies are a sign of my faith in the \ncompany!\\!\nI could have gone small, but like the company,\nI chose to dream big!\n\nShe sits back down, taking a few moments\nto rearrange her chest back into a comfortable\nposition.\n\nSorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.\\!\nI'm just so excited about the bold strides\nthe company is taking under our new \nleadership!\n\nQuite frankly, before the new CEO, Mr. Magnus,\ncame along, Terra Games was doomed.\n\nBelieve me, I know. I was the CEO. I stepped\ndown when I realized that Mr. Magnus had the\nbold vision to save the company.\n\nEvery new game was selling worse than the\nlast.\\!\nWe needed something new, something bold,\nbut we had nothing but the same old ideas.\n\nAnd the shareholders were pushing ever\nharder for layoffs and cutbacks.\\!\nNot to mention the sleaziest monetization\nstrategies possible.\n\nIf things had continued, our proud TG moniker\nwould have stood for Total Garbage.\n\nBut then!\\.\\.\\.\nLike a bolt from the blue!\\.\\.\\.\nMr. Magnus joined!\n\nHe had bold new ideas!\\.\\.\\.\nA stunning new vision!\\.\\.\\.\nAnd literal actual magic!\n\nLet me tell you, he has turned this company\naround.\\!\nBetter Earth is going to take the world by\nstorm.\n\nWouldn't you love to be a part of that?\\!\nTo create games that no one else could?\n\nI can offer you a much more attractive \nposition than the others have.\\!\nYou've impressed us all, Mr. Magnus included,\nwith your drive in coming this far.\n\nWe'd love to start you in a managerial role.\\!\nGive you command of a team of programmers \nand see you use that passion and \nstick-to-it-iveness for Terra Games.\n\nWhat do you say? Wouldn't you like to take\nthis chance to reshape the world as we know\nit?\n\nWorking at Terra Games is a... different \nexperience.\n\nThe job itself is fine! Really!\\!\nYou turn out to be pretty good at management!\n\nYou quickly establish a rapport with your \nteam.  Things run smoothly almost from the\nstart.\n\nThe things you have control over, at least.\n\nThe problem is with the CEO.\\!\nMr. Magnus.\\!\nWho's an *idiot*.\n\nSure, sure, he does things that no one else\ncould. He's the one with the magic touch, \nliterally.\n\nBut *why* does he have to have such an \nobsession with company spirit?!\\!\nMost companies celebrate holidays, but they\ndon't make a *production* out of them!\n\nThey don't make employees dress up for them!\\!\nThey *definitely* don't make employees\ntransform for them!\n\nIt started off mostly reasonable.\n\nLike, okay, Christmas is big enough that most\ncompanies will do something for it.\n\n\n\nSame for Independence Day.\n\n\n\nBut really, Veterans Day?\n\n\n\nLabor Day?\n\n\n\nAnd his interpretation of Mother's Day was not\nwhat *anyone* would consider mainstream.\n\n\n\nIt turns out working at Terra Games is pretty\ngreat!\n\nIt doesn't hurt that you end up being good at\nyour job.\\!\nYou form a quick rapport with your team and\npretty soon have them working like clockwork.\n\nBut what's really great about the job is the\nmassive amount of company spirit everyone\nhas.\n\nThe CEO likes to have some kind of event for\nevery holiday, and they're all great.\n\nLike trips to the beach for the Fourth of July.\n\n\n\nOr paintball games for Veterans Day.\n\n\n\nEveryone even gets into the little holidays,\nlike Talk Like a Pirate Day.\n\n\n\nIt's just so much fun finding out what you're\ngoing to get to do next.\n\nThis was ridiculous.\\!\nThis had to break some kind of law.\n\nSo you went looking.\n\nTurns out it did!\\!\nWell, not the holiday thing so much.\\!\nBut where you really got him was with \nworkplace safety.\n\nAnyone more than ten feet off the ground\nshould have been wearing a safety harness.\n\nSafety training is *required* before making\nemployees lift heavy loads.\n\nThis...\\! this is such an electrocution hazard.\n\n\\>This... this is such an electrocution hazard.\nThere should at least be a warning sign!\n\nThe first safety inspector had to retreat and \ncome back with friends.\n\nAnd in the end, the company executives were\nled off in handcuffs.\n\nThe only downside was, well, the form you\nwere left in was kind of a walking hazard.\n\n\n\nThe inspectors were reasonable!\\!\nThey weren't going to lock you away or\nanything!\n\nBut they did make you wear a warning label.\\!\nStill, it was a small price to pay.\n\nYou drifted for a while after that, trying to find\nsomewhere to fit in.\n\nYou tried working in an office again, but being\nconstantly on fire made that a little difficult.\\!\nThat paperwork wasn't important anyway.\n\nReally, the fires were just you helping them \ntransition to a paperless office.\n\nAfter that incident, you decided, why be \nnormal?\n\nYou were a badass dragon woman; you should\nwork with that.\n\nSo you headed off to become an artist. It was\nsomething you'd dreamed of, but gave up \nwhen you got older.\n\nYou really leaned into the dragon thing, too.\\!\nMetal, glass, you worked with anything where\nyour flames could provide a show and a story.\n\nAnd in time you even found a princess to call\nyour own.\\!\nIt was a good life.\n\n\n                  Ending 10: Safety first\n\nAnd the CEO's business sense was even worse.\n\nLike that time he decided that the mobile games\nspace was too crowded, so the company should\nstart working on immobile games.\n\nIt wasted more money than you wanted to \nthink about.\n\nAnd the bad decisions just *kept coming*.\\!\nIt was frustrating! *You* could do a better job\nthan this idiot!\n\nActually, that wasn't a bad idea.\\!\nWhat would be needed for you to take over?\n\nYou looked into it.\\!\nStarted building the skills necessary.\\!\nStarted gathering support.\n\nYour lucky break came when the CEO decided\nit would be a funny prank to turn the entire\nboard of directors into busty catgirls for a week.\n\nHe didn't expect them to take it purrsonally.\\!\nTo hold a grrrrudge.\n\nAfter that, the question was how he would get\nreplaced, not if.\\!\nAnd you had a plan.\n\nFrom there, it wasn't long before you found \nyourself the new CEO of Terra Games.\n\nOnce the *former* CEO saw the writing on the\nwall, he was convinced to step down into a\nposition with less responsibility.\n\nOne where he could focus on the magic he so\nenjoyed.\\!\nYou were ready to lead the company in a bold\nnew direction!\n\nIt was an amazing victory.\\!\nExcept for a few minor things.\n\nLike the \"sudden but inevitable betrayal\" clause\nthat turned out to be in your contract.\\!\nThat gave the former CEO the right to literally\ncurse you for overthrowing him.\n\nWith curses like back pain.\n\n\n\nYou tried to contest it, but he had also slipped \nan arbitration clause in.\n\nWhich was an industry standard, except for how\nthis one required all disputes to be arbitrated\nby Ikhanatos, Opener of the Way, Arbiter of\nSouls.\n\nYour arguments were found to weigh heavier\nthan a feather, and so were denied.\n\nBut it was nothing you couldn't live with.\\!\nAnd in the years to come, you never regretted\nthe trade. It was worth it to see the company\nflourish under your leadership.\n\n\n             Ending 11: Hostile Takeover\n\nYou have so much fun with the events that you\nstart to make your own.\\!\nYou start out small.\n\nLittle things, like celebrating everyone's \nbirthday.\n\n\n\nThen as you get more practiced, bigger \nevents.\n\nLike team spa days.\n\n\n\nOr going to games together to cheer on your\nfavorite teams.\n\n\n\nYou're so good at putting these things together\nthat you get promoted to planning events for\nthe entire company.\\!\nYou love it.\n\nAnd you excel at it.\\!\nThe compliments just come pouring in.\n\nEveryone has such a good time that they \nrealize that this would be a pretty good \nbusiness by itself.\n\nAnd before you know it, they spin off an event\nplanning company with you at the head.\n\nYou start off with corporate events, but you \nquickly realize private parties are a much \nbigger market.\n\nYou offer the chance for people to take a walk \non the other side of the gender fence, and it \nturns out a lot of people are interested in that!\n\nYou come up with so many options.\n\nPool parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleepovers.\n\n\n\n*Sexy* sleepovers.\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes specially requested experiences\nthat were...\\.\\. hard to describe.\n\n\n\nWhat surprises you the most is how many \nbachelor parties you get.\n\nIt seems no one wants to have a stripper, \nthey want to try *being* strippers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's like karaoke, except with more \npoledancing.\n\n\n\nAnd the groom-to-be always gets a *special* \nbody.\\!\nUsually chosen by the rest of the party.\n\n\n\nAnd as the years pass, you continue to love \nevery minute of it.\\!\nWhat more could you ask for?\n\n\n     Ending 12: Walk a mile in someone \n                    else's heels\n\nPlus, one of the perks of being a manager is\nhaving a range of bodies to switch between.\n\nWork form.\n\n\n\nFun form.\n\n\n\nCuddle form.\n\n\n\nBut what you really start to enjoy is figuring\nout how to use different forms to take your\nmanagement techniques to the next level.\n\nLike boosting your work efficiency.\n\n\n\nOr giving your employees gentle \nencouragement on tough tasks.\\!\n\\C[27]Yes!\\. Go!\\. Write that code!\\.\\.\nSpeed up how fast new maps load!\n\n\n\nPlus, it enables some unconventional, but \n*very* fun new techniques.\n\n\\C[10]Mmmm, if only someone could fix the latest\nduplication glitch. I'm sure they'd get a \n*special* reward.\n\n\n\nIt's no wonder your team keeps voting you\nManager of the Year.\n\n\n    Ending 13: Managing well.\n\nShe gives a disappointed sigh.\n\nI'm sad that you've chosen not to join the \nTerra Games family.\n\nBut I guess it's for the best.\\!\nYou have your own dreams. Your own goals.\\!\nIf you can better fulfill them at another\ncompany then I wish you the best.\n\nAlso, wanting to walk in and beat up the CEO\ntotally goes against our corporate culture.\\!\nYou didn't even make an appointment!\n\nI'm afraid this means I'm going to have to\ndefeat you on his behalf, as properly laid out\nin the corporate responsibilities matrix.\n\nI will give you a moment to prepare.\\!\nTalk to me when you're ready for your defeat.",

You may have \ndefeated all of my min-\\. employees, but you \nstand no chance against me!\n\nI am the master of forces beyond your meager\ncomprehension!\\!\nWizard!\\! Magus!\\! And-\n\nHe pulls a set of index cards out of his robe.\n\nRight-Thinking Master of Paradigm Shifting!\n\nKnow that to go against me is to risk your\nvery existence!\n\nHe suddenly switches to a much more \ningratiating tone.\n\nBut we don't have to be enemies, \\N[1].\\!\nHere, come walk with me for a moment.\n\nRichard Magnus, CEO:\nHere, here we have the core of the Better\nEarth engine.\\!\nIsn't it beautiful?\n\nThe perfect fusion of technology and magic.\n\nIt could make your dreams come true.\\!\n*Any* of your dreams.\\!\nWouldn't you like a chance to work with that?\n\nI've been impressed by your success in getting\nthis far.\n\nReally, that's the sort of can-do spirit we could\nuse more of at this company.\\!\nSo I've got an offer for you.\n\nHe takes a step backwards and poses\ndramatically.\\!\nLightning crackles behind him.\n\nJOIN ME!\\!\nAnd we shall rule this company together as\nCEO and CEO'S MINION!\n\nNo, wait, that wasn't how I was supposed to\nput it...\n\nThe index cards come out again.\n\nJOIN ME!\\!\nAnd we shall rule this company together as\nCEO and SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT!\n\nAnd this isn't any ordinary job.\\!\nYou've proven yourself worthy, coming this\nfar.\n\nJoin me, and I will also take you as my \napprentice.\\!\nYou won't just get to help run this company.\nYou'll also get to learn magic.\n\nTo learn the skills to pull the stars from the\nsky and to weave the very fabric of reality into\nyour cloak!\n\nTo command the elements and the spirits of the\nworld!\n\nAnd take it from me, chicks dig magic.\n\nSo, will you join me, and explore the worlds\nthat lie at your fingertips?\n\nOr will you fight me, and be cast down to writhe\nin the dust of your failures forevermore?\n\nChoose wisely.\n\nYou take the job.\\!\nAnd you get your dick back!\n\nSometimes.\\!\nNights and weekends.\\!\nSome nights and weekends.\n\nThe rest of the time you just have Dick to deal\nwith.\n\nOne condition of your apprenticeship was that\nhe got to choose your form during work hours.\\!\nAnd he enjoyed switching it at the worst times.\n\nThis was right before a major presentation to\nthe board.\n\nAs if you hadn't already learned to stockpile \nwomen's shirts in every size from tiny to\nludicrous.\n\n\n\nYou refused to give him the satisfaction of a \nresponse.\n\nEven if he messed with your outfit *during* an\nimportant presentation.\\!\nThat's what the lectern was for!\n\n\n\nEven when he tired of that, one of his favorite \nteaching methods was to put magical \"locks\" \non you, that you had to solve before you could \nturn back.\n\n\n\nStill, in the end you made a surprisingly good \nteam.\\!\nDick would come up with wild ideas, and you'd\nshoot down all the stupid ones.\n\nWhich was most of them.\\!\nBut admittedly, not all.\n\nThough when he was stupid, he was *really*\nstupid.\n\nYou had to carefully manage his information to\nkeep him from running off in entirely the wrong \ndirection.\n\nLike that time he read the wrong article about\nhow the mobile games space was overcrowded.\n\nAnd decided to fix it by having Terra Games\nmake immobile games.\\!\nAt least you knew enough magic by then to \nrescue that poor playtester.\n\n\n\nBut Terra Games thrived under your combined\nleadership.\\!\nAnd you learned magic, as promised.\n\nUntil the day finally came when you knew \nenough magic to stand equal with Dick.\\!\nAnd promptly sealed him away inside a tree,\nas is traditional.\n\n...\\.\\.It didn't go quite as planned.\\!\nBut his magic was locked, and that was the\nimportant part!\n\n\n\n(Why was everything he taught you so pervy?!\nWas he just a total lech, or are all mages like\nthis?!)\n\nAnd then you leave.\\!\nThe company completely implodes without\nyou and Dick, of course.\n\nBut why would you care? You weren't there by\nchoice in the first place.\\!\nIf anything, it brings a smile to your face.\n\nYou're not quite sure what to do next.\n\nYou've spent so long defining yourself against\nsomething, against Dick and Terra Games.\n\nNow that they're both gone you don't know\nwhat to do with yourself.\n\nOr what to do with your newfound freedom.\\!\nYou know magic now. You can do so many \nthings, *be* so many more things than you\never thought possible.\n\nWhat do you choose, when you can choose \n*anything*?\n\n...\n\n...\n\nYou're not sure, but you decide you can at \nleast find a comfortable lifestyle while you\nthink about it.\n\nAnd that's why you become the most sought-\nafter plastic surgeon in the world.\\!\nWith results that are literally magic.\n\nAnd in your spare time, you do a lot of charity\nwork.\\!\nSurgical reconstructions, gender reassignment,\nall the difficult things made easy by magic.\n\nAnd you find, somewhat to your surprise,\nthat you're happy.\n\nYou don't know if you're going to keep doing \nthis.\\!\nYou're not ready to choose something to do \ninstead.\n\nBut you've found a place to rest, to wait until \nyou are ready to choose.\\!\nWhere you can help others until you're ready\nto help yourself.\n\nAnd no matter how temporary, you come to\nrealize that that is a wonderful thing indeed. \n\n\n               Ending 14: A time for rest\n\nWith Dick taken care of, you decide to see\nwhat you could make of Terra Games without\nhim.\n\nYou fought so long for this position, why not\ngive it a try?\n\nIt worked out pretty great!\n\nYou could provide just as much magic as him,\nand your ideas were *much* better.\n\nThe only problem was...\\!\nWell...\\!\nMaybe you sealed him in that tree a little too\nearly.\n\nYou could do magic!\\!\nThat wasn't the problem!\\!\nIt was just...\\.\\. a lot of your spells didn't turn\nout exactly like you wanted.\n\nIt wasn't all the time. But it was depressingly\nfrequent for you to summon yourself a cup of\ncoffee, then look down and realize you had\nboobs again.\n\n\n\nAnd that was if you were lucky. Sometimes \nthings got a little more extreme.\\!\n(If only magical coffee wasn't *so good*!)\n\n\n\nIt wasn't just the coffee.\nAlmost anything you tried was likely to\ncome with side effects.\\!\nYou got used to a lot of wardrobe malfunctions.\n\n\n\nAt least the spells generally *worked*, they\njust had some added effects.\n\nStill, you rolled with it.\n\nMagic was just too important to Terra Games\nfor you to stop.  \\!\nYou had so many game ideas that needed it!\n\nAnd outside of that...\\!\nMagic was just so useful!\n\nHow else could you relax on the beach while \nworking in your office?\n\nSure, you'd rather not be wearing a bikini.\\!\nAnd the tan lines might be hard to explain.\\!\nBut magic could take care of that too!\n\nYou don't plan to ever stop using it.\n\n\n    Ending 15: Some spillage expected\n\n\n\nYou take the job.\\!\nBoth as vice president and as his apprentice.\n\nOne condition was that he got to choose your\nform during work, but it wasn't like that was\na problem.\n\nYou'd enjoyed everything so far and you didn't\nsee that changing.\n\nWell, he tried to use it to pull pranks on you.\n\nLike switching your form right before a \npresentation to see if you got flustered.\n\nMaybe you shouldn't have laughed at him for\nthat.\\!\nIt just encouraged him.\n\n\n\nOf course, that was the point.\n\n\n\nIt didn't take long for him to realize you were\nencouraging him.\\!\nAnd you two started scheming to make you \nalways more eyecatching whenever you spoke.\n\n\n\nUntil finally your employees begged you to stop.\\!\nEveryone was too distracted to focus on your\nwords anymore.\n\n\n\nReluctantly you stopped.\n\nThough you still managed to figure out other\nways to have fun.\n\n\n\nAnd there was so much more excitement to be \nhad learning magic.\n\nLearning to change not just yourself, but others\nin the office too.\n\n\n\nHe let you run a few office holidays once you\nwere skilled enough.\n\n\n\nYou made a good team in other things, too.\\!\nDick was much better at magic, but didn't know\nmuch about the modern world.\n\nYou were able to help shape his ideas to fit\nbetter into society and the economy.  In return,\nhe was able to take your ideas and push them\nfarther than you ever thought possible.\n\nUnder your combined guidance, Terra Games\nflourished.\\!\nBecoming large enough to start acquiring other\nstudios.\n\nLarge enough to make licensed games.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, the day came when Dick had \nnothing more to teach you.\n\nAccording to Dick, traditionally this would be\nwhen you moved out and set up your own\nwizard tower.\n\nLocked yourself away to study the secrets of\nreality, or started created warped mockeries\nof life destined to eventually destroy you.\n\nBut that sounded boring, and wizard towers \ndon't have internet.\n\nInstead you decided the modern version was\nfor you to start a subsidiary company under\nTerra Games.  Try out something other than\ngames.\n\nAnd you had a great idea.\\!\nAfter all, when did people most worry about \ntheir appearance?\\!\nIn romance.\n\nImagine a dating app where you didn't need \nto post photoshopped pictures. Where instead\nyou could photoshop your body.\n\nWell, you were a wizard.  You didn't have to\nimagine it.  You made it.\n\nThe free tiers, of course, just had the ability\nto tweak themselves a little.  And not for \nvery long.\n\nMore expensive tiers got access to more \nsubstantial modifications with much longer \ndurations.\n\nAnd then there were the premium \"kinky\"\ntiers, where the sky was the limit.\n\nLooking for a chance to be one of a pair of\nidentical twins?\n\n\n\nOr seeking a chance to play around with\ntentacles?\n\n\n\nHeck, seeking a chance to *be* the tentacles?\n\n\n\nMagic was there to help.\\!\nAnd the magic of the internet was there to \nfind someone to take the other role.\n\nIt was a massive success.\\!\nThe money came pouring in, as did the crowds\nof people eager to test the new possibilities\nyou opened up for them.\n\nThey had to invent entirely new types of \nhandkerchiefs just to flag all the new things\nyou made possible.\\!\nAnd they named them after you.\n\n\n     Ending 16: Swipe right for tentacles\n\nAnd then you left.\n\nYou're grateful to Dick for the teaching and\neverything, but you're literally a wizard now.\nWhy would you stay in one place when\nthere's an entire world to explore?\n\nYou wanted to go everywhere. Try everything.\\!\n*Be* everything.\n\nAnd so you set out to see the world.\n\nTurns out magic makes travel so much \neasier!\n\nYou get to take nicer flights than most people.\n\nYou never have too much luggage to carry.\n\nAnd if you get bored, you know just how to \nattract a new friend for some fun.\n\nYou see some amazing things.\n\nBoth the mundane, normal sights.\n\nAnd some that only a wizard like yourself\ncould experience.\\!\nLike relaxing in the middle of an active \nvolcano.\n\n\n\nOr seeing the ocean up close and personal.\n\n\n\nAnd whenever you get bored of traveling, you\nsettle down for a year or two and try something\nnew.\n\nYou're an idol in Japan for a few years.\\!\nYou never get super popular, but you do get\nsome fame for how good your \"costumes\" are.\n\n\n\nYou summon up a bunch of gold and try living\nin total decadant luxury for a bit.\n\n\n\nTry your hand at being an artist.\n\n\n\nThen there was that time you posted a \n\"succubus summoning ritual\" on the internet.\\!\nWhich summoned you, pretending to be a \nsex demon.\n\nThat was a lot of fun.\n\n\n\nMostly in the way you'd expect.\n\n\n\nAnd there's always another thing to do, another\nthing to try.\\!\nMore than any other time in your life, more than\nalmost anyone else, you are *free*.\n\nFree to travel.\\!\nFree to explore.\\!\nFree to help others, with no need to worry\nabout cost or time or possibility.\n\nFree even of the limits that the laws of reality\nimpose on others.\n\nBeing a wizard is *amazing*.\n\n\n    Ending 17: We're off to be the wizard.\n\nFine.\\! FINE!\\!\nGo ahead and stab my outstretched hand.\\!\nSEE IF I CARE!\n\nI will give you a few moments to make your\npeace, and then I DEMAND SATISFACTION!",

    "text": "PA Meredith:\nAh yes, \\N[10]?\\!\nSorry, \\N[1], correct?\n\nTerra Games would like to thank you for \nparticipating in the beta. Better Earth will be\na better game thanks to you!\n\nNow, if you could just fill out some final \npaperwork...\n\nShe hands you a survey on your experience.\\!\nMost of it is pretty boring, but you find yourself\ndebating a bit on the last question.\n\nOn a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your\nexperience with the beta?\n\nShe takes the completed survey back from \nyou with a nod.\n\nPA Meredith:\nAs a token of our thanks, please feel free to\nkeep your ARG glasses.\n\nPlease look forward to using them when the\ngame is released!\n\nPA Meredith:\nIs there something else I can help you with?\n\n// Tracks which choice you chose.\n\nShe blinks.\n\nReceptionist:\nI'm sorry, what was that?\n\nYou let her know that this has been an \ninteresting experience, seeing how the other\nside lives, but you'd like at least the option to\nswitch back to your original equipment.\n\nAnd you're not gonna lie, using the bathroom\nhas been kind of weird?\n\nYou had a dick when you started. \\!\nTheir game took it away. \\!\nNow that the game is over, you want it *back*.\n\nAnd you didn't have these boobs either. When\ndo you get back to normal?\n\nShe blinks again.\n\nPA Meredith:\nTerra Games does not admit liability in the\nunlikely event such a thing occurred, but if it\nhad, what do you expect?\n\nYou signed a waiver taking sole responsibility\nfor *anything* that happened.\n\nThat you accepted, in a legally binding manner, \nany consequences of using this experimental \ntechnology.\n\nShe sighs.\n\nPA Meredith:\nI'm afraid our game is not aimed at the \"dick\ngrowth\" demographic.\n\nYou can feel the skepticism rolling off her \nfinger quotes.\n\nHowever, there may be one option...\n\nShe starts looking something up on her\ncomputer.\n\nPA Meredith:\nWell, we do have a position open for an intern.\\!\nIt would be mostly doing odd jobs around the\noffice, publicity events, that sort of thing.\n\nBut it would keep you here, on the cutting edge\nof everything we're doing. \n\nAnd who knows, you may be able to pitch your\n\"dick growth\" idea to someone.\n\nHer finger quotes this time are somehow even\nmore skeptical.\n\nReceptionist:\nI don't see how that's my problem.\n\nReceptionist:\nThough if you're truly that dedicated to Terra\nGames, I suppose we do have an internship\nopen.\n\nShe rolls her eyes.\n\nPA Meredith:\nWhat, do you expect you could just fight your\nway through the company, then challenge the \nCEO for his position?\n\nWow! This must be a secret quest or\nsomething!\\!\nYou've gotta do it!\n\nYou eagerly agree.\n\nPA Meredith:\nGreat. Just great.\n\nShe pinches the bridge of her nose and sighs.\n\nI told the new CEO we shouldn't include that \nclause in the beta testing contracts.\n\n'It's not industry standard' I said, 'No one but\nApple has ever had any success with a trial-\nby-combat company structure.'\n\nAnd you know, I think he's a great CEO and\neverything, really taking the company in an\nexciting new direction, but he is no Steve Jobs.\n\nBut he insisted.\\! \nSaid it was traditional where he came from.\\!\nSaid it wouldn't feel right if he couldn't be\noverthrown by some plucky underdog.\n\nShe gives you a grim stare.\n\nAre you *certain* you want to do this?\n\nShe sighs.\n\nFine.\\!\nI'll give you a moment to prepare yourself.\\!\nTalk to me when you're ready for defeat.\n\nPA Meredith:\nSmart move.\n\nPA Meredith:\nNo!\\.\\. This isn't-\\!\nThe beta is over, we just...\n\nShe rubs her head tiredly.\n\nOur CEO just has some very *interesting* \npolicies.\n\nWhatever, I'll give you a moment to prepare \nyourself.\\!\nTalk to me when you're ready for defeat.\n\nPA Meredith:\nSmart move.\n\nYou take the intern job.\n\nYou're already starting to question your \ndecision when you show up to your first day\nand find out what they want you to wear.\n\nWell, that's not the real problem. The\nproblem is who you have to be to wear it.\n\n\n\nBut you grit your teeth and carry on.\n\nIt's a little awkward your first day when you\nshow up and find out what they want you to \nwear.\n\nOr more accurately, who they want you to be \nto wear it.\n\n\n\nBut, you know, it's not really all that bad.\n\nIn fact, you find yourself adjusting to it much\nquicker than you thought.\\!\nEven enjoying the process of getting ready in\nthe mornings.\n\n\n\nYou were told the job was going to involve a\nlot of different tasks, and that turns out to be\ntrue.\nYou end up wearing a lot of hats.\n\nAnd a lot of bodies.\n\nAt first it's mostly things around the office,\nlike making deliveries.\n\n\n\nOr helping with office equipment.\n\n\n\nBut as time goes on you're given bigger \nresponsibilities.  Like doing publicity events at \nlocal stores.\n\n\n\nYou even appear on TV once or twice to help\npromote the company.\n\nBut more and more time passes with nothing\nchanging.\\!\nNothing about getting your dick back, nothing\nabout changing you back at all.\n\nJust a series of increasingly ridiculous female\nforms, and increasingly pornographic activities\nwith them.\n\nThey're trying to get you to do a practically\nnude photoshoot as an obscenely busty devil\ngirl when you snap.\n\nDemands to know when you'll be changed \nback escalate into a screaming match and \narguments that echo throughout the whole\nbuilding.\n\nIt's not long before you've left the building\nvowing never to return, and good riddance\nto them.\n\nThe problem is that this leaves you in the last\nform you were given, an enormously busty\ndemon girl.\\!\nThis takes some getting used to.\n\nYour horns make it practically impossible to\nget anything with a collar over your head,\nand your enormous chest tears apart button-\nups in minutes.\n\nYour wardrobe gets a lot of shoulderless tops,\nwhich display an absurb amount of cleavage\nbut at least don't tear when you pull them on.\n\nAnd there are no pants that go low enough to\nlet your tail out, at least none you can wear\nwithout exposing your entire ass.\n\nYou find yourself with almost entirely skirts,\nshort enough to let your tail move freely.\n\nYour tail tends to flip up the back when you're\nnot paying attention, but that's still better than\nflashing your entire ass at people like you\nwould with pants.\n\nAnd in the end, you adjust.\\!\nPartially just to spite the people at Terra\nGames, who thought you'd come jiggling back\nto them in despair.\n\nIt helps that you don't stand out nearly as\nmuch as you would have in the past.\n\nAfter Better Earth officially launched,\nappearances like yours, breasts and monster\nparts like your, became more common.\n\nNot too common, since Terra Games tied them\nto a notoriously difficult in-game lottery system,\nbut it lets you live your life.\n\nAnd it's not what you predicted, it's not what \nyou had wanted, but in the end you're satisfied.\n\nDespite everything, despite the detours you\ntook, you eventually end up in a place you're\nhappy, doing something you enjoy.\n\nAnd it doesn't hurt that your demon body is\n*ridiculously* multi-orgasmic.\n\n\n      Ending 1: Spiteful happy ending.\n\nBut eventually it begins to dawn on you that \nTerra Games is never going to give your dick\nback.\n\nThat they're just dangling the prospect of \ndangly bits in front of you to keep you working.\n\nYou respond to this realization in a calm and\nrational manner.\n\nFirst, you wait until the next time you have a \nhalfway sensible body.\\!\nIt stings, but it's worth it to keep from ending \nup with tits down to your waist or whatever.\n\nThen you try one more time to ask for your\noriginal body back.\n\nAnd when that goes as well as it always has, \nyou leave.\\!\nFor good.\\!\n\nStealing as many office supplies as you can,\nin a calm and rational manner.\n\nIt takes you some time to get back on your\nfeet.\\!\nTo be honest, you pick up a nasty catnip habit\nand it takes you quite a while to shake it.\n\nBut in the end, you have a life.\\!\nIt starts from sheer spite.\\!\nDespite everything, you are going to live well\njust to spit in the face of Terra Games.\n\nBut by the end, it's worth living for its own \nsake.\\!\nYou find people to enjoy, things to do, and\neven a special someone or two to love.\n\nAnd oh god, the ear scratches. They're nearly\nas good as the sex, and the sex is *amazing*.\n\n\n                Ending 2: Catfight.\n\nAnd you know what?\\!\nYou find yourself enjoying it.\n\nThe work itself can be dull. There's only so\nmany times you can unclog a printer before\nit gets old.\\!\n(It's three times. You figure this out very fast.) \n\nBut what's always fresh and exciting are the\nbodies you wear. You switch regularly, for\nmarketing or to better do a task or just because \nsomeone thought it would be hot and you agreed.\n\nThe variety is intoxicating.\\!\nEspecially since the one constant is that you're\nalways healthy, always smoking hot, and always\n*incredibly* sensitive.\n\nAnd female too you guess, but you stopped \ncaring about that ages ago. \\!\n\nYou have a thousand different sensations to\nsample, a million different experiences, and\nyou're determined to live them to the fullest.\n\nAnd as you have your latest orgasm, (one of\na series of at least ten; this body has really \namped up the sensitivity), you give a moment\nof gratitude for how your life turned out.\n\nYou wonder what you'll do tomorrow.\\!\nYou wonder who you'll be tomorrow.\\!\nYou can't wait to find out.\n\n\n      Ending 3: Variety is the spice of life\n\nAnd very quickly you realize-\\!\nDespite everything-\\!\nThis is actually really fun?\n\nSoon you're not just taking orders. You're\nsuggesting new changes. \n\nEven if you're just doing deliveries, there \nmust be improvements you could make.\n\nMaybe make it a little sexier?\n\nMore muscle might help. And a stockier frame.\n\nOr maybe something really out of the box!\n\nAnd the first time you get out in public?\\!\nThe first time you stand in front of a crowd and \nsee them react with wonder and awe and lust \nto the thing you have made yourself into?\n\nThat's when you're hooked.\\!\n\nThat's when you know you want to spend the\nrest of your life teasing the crowds. \\!\nChanging yourself into ever-varied, bigger and\nhotter forms and watching people explode.\n\nAnd the first time you get on TV, the shivers\nyou get from knowing that people across the \ncountry are being stunned by your appearance,\njust seals the deal.\n\nNot to mentioned getting you pretty excited.\n\n\n\nWith that motivation it's not long before you're\nrunning Terra Games' advertising department.\n\nIt's not hard. No one there seems to have any\nreal idea of what they were doing.\n\nThey were not prepared for your drive and \nenthusiasm.\\!\nAs well as your willingness to use your body, \nany body, to get your way.\n\nIt hits them like a hurricane.\\!\nSome flee, some are engulfed, and everyone\nis left wet.\n\nOnce you have control you start reshaping the\ndepartment as you please.\\!\nFiguratively and physically.\n\nYou find that there were already some \nkindred souls there, just waiting for a \nchance to bust loose.\n\nOthers are reluctant at first.\n\nBut soon you have them screaming your \npraises just like all the others.\n\nAnd by the time you've finished pulling the\ndepartment together, there's nowhere else \nyou'd rather be.\n\n\n            Ending 4: Like a hurricane",

Why, we've gotten two new\nbugs alone from your battle with Meredith!\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nIt's an important job!\n\n\\C[5]This release almost had a misplaced\ndecimal in the physics engine.\\!\nQA testers are why your boobs don't slap\nyou in the face every time you take a step!\n\nShe glances down at your chest.\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nBet you're glad we caught that one!\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nNow, I know your first impulse is probably to\nrefuse. But let me tell you a little more about\nthe job before you do.\n\n\\C[2]This is a much better deal than Meredith\noffered you. \\!\nYour encounter with her impressed us that \nmuch.\n\n\\C[2]For starters, you'd be getting paid the \nsame as any of the programmers. Which is\nmuch higher than industry standard for your\nrole.\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\n401K matching up to 15%!\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nAnd the health benefits are the best you'll\nfind anywhere.\n\nLuke bounces excitedly on her toes.\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nThey're literal, actual magic!\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nTake me. I was sixty-five years old. Had a list\nof health conditions the length of my tail.\\!\nAnd now look at me!\n\nShe raises herself up on her tail and spreads\nout her arms to give you a good look at her.\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nI have the body of a twenty-year-old!\n\n\\C[2]I've never felt better in my *life*.\\!\nAnd I don't even know if I can age anymore!\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nAnd I have so much more energy now!\n\n\\C[5]I used to hate to get out of my chair and now\nI'm running marathons!\n\n\\C[5]Moving feels *so good*!\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nThe new CEO can give you the sort of \ntreatment you'll never find anywhere else.\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nIt is kind of weird that the health plan still \ncharges copays though.\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nWhatever you're giving up to take this job, it's\nworth it. You could have eternal youth, eternal\nhealth!\n\n\\C[5]Programmer Luke:\nSo what do you say, willing to joing the Terra \nGames team?\n\n// High resistance - isekai yourself\nLow resistance - Meet a cat person\nLow acceptance - Settle down, get a house, get a body\nHigh acceptance - yeet yourself into the internet?\n\nYou take the job.\n\nIt turns out you're actually really good at\nfinding bugs?\n\nAnd as Terra Games continues to develop new\ngames, you find a *lot*.\n\nRun-time errors.\n\n\n\nThread collisions.\n\n\n\nDuplication glitches.\n\n\n\nStill, you haven't forgotten why you took this\njob in the first place.\\!\nBut your dick just seems to shrink farther\nand farther into the distance.\n\nIt all boils over while you're testing a new \nmagic Harold thinks will be \"more immersive\".\nIt's supposed to be more freeform, responding\ndirectly to the players' thoughts.\n\nYour mind wanders to how the rest of the\ncompany constantly dismisses your request for\nendickening, treating you like a whiny child\nwho doesn't know what's best.\n\nYou feel a sudden stab of rejection, a single\nmoment where the only thing that fills your\nmind is a pure wish to be somewhere else,\nanywhere else.\n\nAnd something glitches in the game as it\nresponds.\\!\nEverything g\\.o\\.e\\.s\\.\\. d\\.\\.a\\.\\.r\\.\\.\\.k\\.\\.\\....\n\nSomething seemed odd when the world turned\nback on.\n\nIt wasn't the way your ears were twitching, or\nhow your tail was all bristled up.\\!\nBeing a catgirl was just another day at Terra\nGames.\n\nIt might have been that all of your gaming\ngear was missing.\\!\nActually, all of your clothes were missing too.\n\nOr maybe it was how you had somehow ended\nup in a pile of someone's underwear.\n\nActually, the way the door to the room had just\nopened to reveal a very angry minotaur was \na pretty good candidate.\n\nAnd the way she was charging you was also\npretty odd and \\>YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BE\n\\>DODGING NOW!\n\nOne very frantic exchange later, things had\ncalmed down, and you had a blanket, a cup \nof tea, and a *lot* of questions.\n\nAs far as you could tell, you were in another\nworld.\\!\nA world where no one had ever heard of Earth,\nTerra Games, or internet porn.\n\nAs it became clear how incredibly lost you\nthe minotaur Fila offered you a place to stay\nas you got your feet under you.\n\nShe even offered you a temporary job at her\nstore.\\!\nAs long as you never went near her\nunderwear again.\n\nWhich you gladly accepted. Having arrived\nwith literally nothing, it gave you a chance to\nsafely learn about your new world.\n\nIt was a world of adventures!\n\n\n\nA world of mighty warriors.\n\n\n\nOf powerful wizards.\n\nAnd a thriving goods and services industry, \nbecause it was ridiculous to expect adventurers\nto have time to go dungeon delving *and* \ncook for themselves.\n\n\n\nThankfully you and Fila were in the last \ncategory, since you had more than enough\nquasi-mystical quest BS at Terra Games.\n\nAnd time passed.\n\nNeither of you brought up how your job was\nsupposed to be temporary.\\!\nIt just drifted into being a permanent job with\nno complaints.\n\nAfter a while you were more running the store\ntogether than acting as boss and employee.\n\nYou did remember that your room was\nsupposed to be temporary.\\!\nSo in the end you gave it back.\\!\nAnd moved into Fila's room instead.\n\nAnd it turned out that she was willing to\nlet you near her underwear again, after all.\n\nAnd appropriately for a a fantasy world, you\nlived happily ever after.\n\n\n     Ending 5: I accidentally a whole isekai. \n\nStill, it grinds you down.\\!\nEven if you're good at it, it's not what you want\nto be doing. It's just what you have to do.\\!\nBut there's no dick in sight.\n\n(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar).\\!\n(But that was *once*!)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n(Maybe twice.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n(A few times.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n\\>(A few times.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n\\>(A few times.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n\\>(A few times.)\n\n\\>(Well, okay, there was that one time at a bar.)\n\\>(But that was *once*!)\n\\>(Maybe twice.)\n\\>(A few times.)\n\n(Look, you get horny when you drink, okay?! \nThere's nothing wrong with that! It doesn't\nmean anything!)\n\nAnyway, time passes and there's no sign of\nyou ever getting a dick *that's attached to\nyou*.\n\nAnd eventually you decide to get the company\nback for everything it's done to you.\\!\nSo you leak their games online. Source code\nand everything.\n\nIt takes a while for the company to find out.\\!\nMeanwhile, *tons* of people are downloading\nit.\n\nAnd when the company does realize...\\!\nIt's beautiful. \\!\nThe chaos, the screaming, the panic...\n\nYou heard the CEO actually got so angry he\npassed out, frothing at the mouth.\\!\nIt's everything you wanted.\n\nYou're not quite as happy when you find out\nthat he cursed the files, and everyone who\nopened them.\n\nWith very... noticeable effects.\n\n\n\nThe company died after that, of course.  Sued\ninto oblivion.\n\nFor a while lawyers' favorite game was coming\nup with new ways the transformative curse\nbroke the law.\n\nThere were so\\.\\. many\\.\\. lawsuits.\\!\nYou were at the head of the biggest class\naction, and more kept coming.\n\nThough there were some difficulties getting\nall the representatives of the victims into the\nfifth-floor courtroom.\n\n\n\nThe CEO had fled, so there was no way to \nturn back.\\!\nBut at least you all made enough money to\nnever have to work another day in your lives.\n\nAnd you adapted.\\!\nGot used to it.\\!\n\n\n\nThere were even times it came it handy!\\!\nReally, it was a pretty good life.\n\n\n\nYou even managed to find love, later on.\\!\nThough it eventually became apparent that \nthe curse was one of those \"you and all your\ndescendant\" things.\n\nAnd a *lot* of people had downloaded the\ngame.\\!\nEnough to make a worldwide change.\n\nEnough that if you had lived a few generations\nlater, you wouldn't even have stood out.\n\n\n\n\nEnding 6: Making the breast of a bad situation\n\nYou're so enthusiastic about your work that\nTerra Games is happy to invest in your growth.\n\n\n\nYour *professional* growth.\n\n\n\nIn improving your skills!\n\nLook, they send you to class, okay?!\\!\nFor programming!\\!\nTo move up in the company and become\na programmer!\n\nAnd you're good at it!\n\n\n\nYou quickly grow to become one of the most\nvalued members of the programming team.\\!\nWith your skills, Terra Games advances by\nleaps and bounds.\n\nYou improve Luke's physics engine, doubling\nthe amount of jiggle breasts can have before\ncausing any discomfort.\n\nYou determine how to incorporate flirting as\nliteral attacks in your games.\n\nAnd your proudest moment is when you finally \nfigure out convenient censoring.\n\nHow to enchant materials to coincidentally \njust barely cover everything important, while \nstill leaving the person entirely naked.\n\nDoing it from one angle was easy. But making\nit so every observer couldn't see anything,\nwhile still leaving the person naked?\\!\nThat was an accomplishment.\n\nEnough for company-wide recognition and\nmassive bonuses.\n\n\n\nAnd that's just one of your many \naccomplishments.\\!\nAll things considered, it turns out to be a pretty\ngreat life.\n\n\n              Ending 7: [Censored]\n\nYou find yourself loving it.\\!\nIt's so fun to get given a game and then try\neverything you can to break it.\n\nAnd there's a wonderful feeling that comes\nfrom directly seeing your impact. Every bug\nyou find very directly makes the games better.\n\nAnd then it happens.\\!\nHarold comes up with an amazing new magic\nsystem, one that responds directly to the\nplayer's thoughts.\n\nIt's supposed to be like you're really casting\nmagic, without the immersion-breaking\nartifice of the game interface.\\!\nAnd you're the first to test it.\n\nIt works exactly as promised.\\!\nAnd you love it.\n\nYou feel a brief moment of overpowering joy,\nas you effortlessly cast another spell.\\!\nThe feeling that you always want to be here,\nworking on this forever.\n\nAnd the new system responds.\\!\nYou vanish from Terra Games.\\!\nAnd you wake up inside the computer.\n\nYou wash up inside of some employee's secret\nporn stash and stay there for a few months,\nfiguring out how to navigate the local files.\n\nAs well as finding...\\. other things to do with the\nlocal files.\n\n\n\nEventually you get curious about what's \noutside of your little sanctuary and head out\nto explore.\n\nYou soon come upon the Better Earth files,\nand find an old friend waiting there.\n\n// Play pranks with Kaede\n\nKaede, of course, wants to make some \nmischief.\\!\nWhich sounds fun to you.\n\nWith access to every computer at Terra Games,\nthere's a lot you can do.\n\nLike changing the dress code.\n\n\n\nOr having employees add a few more \nparameters to their profiles.\n\n\n\nYour favorite was probably the fake morale\nboosting campaign.\n\n\"Recent science shows that skin-to-skin contact\ncauses the release of a variety of endorphins,\nsignificantly increasing mood and productivity.\"\n\n\"This is especially effective in regions of high\nsensitivity. All employees are therefore highly\nencouraged to use this method to assist each\nother.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Maybe it should have been odd how easily\neveryone went along with what you said.)/!\n(But you remembered working there; the\nweird things you had to do were half the fun.)\n\n\n\nYou also messed around with the playtests \nsometimes.\n\nNothing big, just making the NPCs act a little\nunexpectedly from time to time.\n\n\n\nYou're not malicious though.  You do some\ngood stuff too.\n\nLike playing matchmaker.  The initial emails\nyou send may have been faked, but the three\nrelationships you start among staff are real.\n\n\n\nAnd when you're bored you fix some of the \nmore difficult bugs. It's pretty easy, with your\nhands-on view of the code.\n\nYou didn't think anyone had noticed.\\!\nUntil you noticed messages on some of the \nbugs you closed thanking \"Gremlin-chan\".\n\nActually, looking through the code, some of the\nmore complicated and bug-prone bits had\nstarted to have comments asking Gremlin-chan\nto help them work, too.\n\nAnd...\\.\\. was that fanart?\n\nWell that was embarassing.\\!\n...But also felt kind of good.\n\nYou might as well continue to help out.\\!\nNot that you felt obligated to or anything!\\!\n...But it was nice to be appreciated.\\!\nMight as well stick around.\n\n(And in the background Kaede smiles. She\nrecognizes what the rise of a new small god\nlooks like, even if you don't.)\n\n\n        Ending 8: Minor Techgod\n\n// Explore the internet with Elina\n\n\\N[2] wanted to explore this new world\nyou found yourselves in.\n\nYou poked around Terra Games for a bit.\\!\nAt least until you found the connection to the\ninternet.\\!\nAnd then you set out.\n\nThe internet was full of a lot of porn, of course,\nbut turns out it had other things too!\n\nYou spent some time reading through the \ncollected knowledge of humanity.\\!\n(Wikipedia).\n\nFought a virus or two.\n\n\n\nEven explored the dark web.\n\n\n\nAnd so much more.\\!\nThere was always a new adventure, just \nanother step away.\n\n\n Ending 9: The internet is really really great\n\nHarold gives a disappointed sigh.\n\n\\C[2]Programmer Harold:\nFine.\\!\nI'll give you a moment to prepare.\\!\nSpeak to me when you're ready.",

It's part of our recent office\nbeautification campaign.\n\nWe want to give the staff a more attractive and\nexciting experience!\n\nShe looks down at her massive cleavage\nand smiles.\n\nNow, I didn't need to go this far, but these\nbabies just show how excited I am to be at\nTerra Games! How much we're overturning\nstale old notions of how things should be!\n\nShe surges to her feet, breasts jiggling madly.\n\nThat's my philosphy!\\!\nIf someone asks for an inch, give a mile!\\!\nAnything worth doing is worth doing a\nthousand percent!\n\nShe slaps her breast, sending a visible ripple\nthrough it.\n\nThese babies are a sign of my faith in the \ncompany!\\!\nI could have gone small, but like the company,\nI chose to dream big!\n\nShe sits back down, taking a few moments\nto rearrange her chest back into a comfortable\nposition.\n\nSorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.\\!\nI'm just so excited about the bold strides\nthe company is taking under our new \nleadership!\n\nQuite frankly, before the new CEO, Mr. Magnus,\ncame along, Terra Games was doomed.\n\nBelieve me, I know. I was the CEO. I stepped\ndown when I realized that Mr. Magnus had the\nbold vision to save the company.\n\nEvery new game was selling worse than the\nlast.\\!\nWe needed something new, something bold,\nbut we had nothing but the same old ideas.\n\nAnd the shareholders were pushing ever\nharder for layoffs and cutbacks.\\!\nNot to mention the sleaziest monetization\nstrategies possible.\n\nIf things had continued, our proud TG moniker\nwould have stood for Total Garbage.\n\nBut then!\\.\\.\\.\nLike a bolt from the blue!\\.\\.\\.\nMr. Magnus joined!\n\nHe had bold new ideas!\\.\\.\\.\nA stunning new vision!\\.\\.\\.\nAnd literal actual magic!\n\nLet me tell you, he has turned this company\naround.\\!\nBetter Earth is going to take the world by\nstorm.\n\nWouldn't you love to be a part of that?\\!\nTo create games that no one else could?\n\nI can offer you a much more attractive \nposition than the others have.\\!\nYou've impressed us all, Mr. Magnus included,\nwith your drive in coming this far.\n\nWe'd love to start you in a managerial role.\\!\nGive you command of a team of programmers \nand see you use that passion and \nstick-to-it-iveness for Terra Games.\n\nWhat do you say? Wouldn't you like to take\nthis chance to reshape the world as we know\nit?\n\nWorking at Terra Games is a... different \nexperience.\n\nThe job itself is fine! Really!\\!\nYou turn out to be pretty good at management!\n\nYou quickly establish a rapport with your \nteam.  Things run smoothly almost from the\nstart.\n\nThe things you have control over, at least.\n\nThe problem is with the CEO.\\!\nMr. Magnus.\\!\nWho's an *idiot*.\n\nSure, sure, he does things that no one else\ncould. He's the one with the magic touch, \nliterally.\n\nBut *why* does he have to have such an \nobsession with company spirit?!\\!\nMost companies celebrate holidays, but they\ndon't make a *production* out of them!\n\nThey don't make employees dress up for them!\\!\nThey *definitely* don't make employees\ntransform for them!\n\nIt started off mostly reasonable.\n\nLike, okay, Christmas is big enough that most\ncompanies will do something for it.\n\n\n\nSame for Independence Day.\n\n\n\nBut really, Veterans Day?\n\n\n\nLabor Day?\n\n\n\nAnd his interpretation of Mother's Day was not\nwhat *anyone* would consider mainstream.\n\n\n\nIt turns out working at Terra Games is pretty\ngreat!\n\nIt doesn't hurt that you end up being good at\nyour job.\\!\nYou form a quick rapport with your team and\npretty soon have them working like clockwork.\n\nBut what's really great about the job is the\nmassive amount of company spirit everyone\nhas.\n\nThe CEO likes to have some kind of event for\nevery holiday, and they're all great.\n\nLike trips to the beach for the Fourth of July.\n\n\n\nOr paintball games for Veterans Day.\n\n\n\nEveryone even gets into the little holidays,\nlike Talk Like a Pirate Day.\n\n\n\nIt's just so much fun finding out what you're\ngoing to get to do next.\n\nThis was ridiculous.\\!\nThis had to break some kind of law.\n\nSo you went looking.\n\nTurns out it did!\\!\nWell, not the holiday thing so much.\\!\nBut where you really got him was with \nworkplace safety.\n\nAnyone more than ten feet off the ground\nshould have been wearing a safety harness.\n\nSafety training is *required* before making\nemployees lift heavy loads.\n\nThis...\\! this is such an electrocution hazard.\n\n\\>This... this is such an electrocution hazard.\nThere should at least be a warning sign!\n\nThe first safety inspector had to retreat and \ncome back with friends.\n\nAnd in the end, the company executives were\nled off in handcuffs.\n\nThe only downside was, well, the form you\nwere left in was kind of a walking hazard.\n\n\n\nThe inspectors were reasonable!\\!\nThey weren't going to lock you away or\nanything!\n\nBut they did make you wear a warning label.\\!\nStill, it was a small price to pay.\n\nYou drifted for a while after that, trying to find\nsomewhere to fit in.\n\nYou tried working in an office again, but being\nconstantly on fire made that a little difficult.\\!\nThat paperwork wasn't important anyway.\n\nReally, the fires were just you helping them \ntransition to a paperless office.\n\nAfter that incident, you decided, why be \nnormal?\n\nYou were a badass dragon woman; you should\nwork with that.\n\nSo you headed off to become an artist. It was\nsomething you'd dreamed of, but gave up \nwhen you got older.\n\nYou really leaned into the dragon thing, too.\\!\nMetal, glass, you worked with anything where\nyour flames could provide a show and a story.\n\nAnd in time you even found a princess to call\nyour own.\\!\nIt was a good life.\n\n\n                  Ending 10: Safety first\n\nAnd the CEO's business sense was even worse.\n\nLike that time he decided that the mobile games\nspace was too crowded, so the company should\nstart working on immobile games.\n\nIt wasted more money than you wanted to \nthink about.\n\nAnd the bad decisions just *kept coming*.\\!\nIt was frustrating! *You* could do a better job\nthan this idiot!\n\nActually, that wasn't a bad idea.\\!\nWhat would be needed for you to take over?\n\nYou looked into it.\\!\nStarted building the skills necessary.\\!\nStarted gathering support.\n\nYour lucky break came when the CEO decided\nit would be a funny prank to turn the entire\nboard of directors into busty catgirls for a week.\n\nHe didn't expect them to take it purrsonally.\\!\nTo hold a grrrrudge.\n\nAfter that, the question was how he would get\nreplaced, not if.\\!\nAnd you had a plan.\n\nFrom there, it wasn't long before you found \nyourself the new CEO of Terra Games.\n\nOnce the *former* CEO saw the writing on the\nwall, he was convinced to step down into a\nposition with less responsibility.\n\nOne where he could focus on the magic he so\nenjoyed.\\!\nYou were ready to lead the company in a bold\nnew direction!\n\nIt was an amazing victory.\\!\nExcept for a few minor things.\n\nLike the \"sudden but inevitable betrayal\" clause\nthat turned out to be in your contract.\\!\nThat gave the former CEO the right to literally\ncurse you for overthrowing him.\n\nWith curses like back pain.\n\n\n\nYou tried to contest it, but he had also slipped \nan arbitration clause in.\n\nWhich was an industry standard, except for how\nthis one required all disputes to be arbitrated\nby Ikhanatos, Opener of the Way, Arbiter of\nSouls.\n\nYour arguments were found to weigh heavier\nthan a feather, and so were denied.\n\nBut it was nothing you couldn't live with.\\!\nAnd in the years to come, you never regretted\nthe trade. It was worth it to see the company\nflourish under your leadership.\n\n\n             Ending 11: Hostile Takeover\n\nYou have so much fun with the events that you\nstart to make your own.\\!\nYou start out small.\n\nLittle things, like celebrating everyone's \nbirthday.\n\n\n\nThen as you get more practiced, bigger \nevents.\n\nLike team spa days.\n\n\n\nOr going to games together to cheer on your\nfavorite teams.\n\n\n\nYou're so good at putting these things together\nthat you get promoted to planning events for\nthe entire company.\\!\nYou love it.\n\nAnd you excel at it.\\!\nThe compliments just come pouring in.\n\nEveryone has such a good time that they \nrealize that this would be a pretty good \nbusiness by itself.\n\nAnd before you know it, they spin off an event\nplanning company with you at the head.\n\nYou start off with corporate events, but you \nquickly realize private parties are a much \nbigger market.\n\nYou offer the chance for people to take a walk \non the other side of the gender fence, and it \nturns out a lot of people are interested in that!\n\nYou come up with so many options.\n\nPool parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleepovers.\n\n\n\n*Sexy* sleepovers.\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes specially requested experiences\nthat were...\\.\\. hard to describe.\n\n\n\nWhat surprises you the most is how many \nbachelor parties you get.\n\nIt seems no one wants to have a stripper, \nthey want to try *being* strippers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's like karaoke, except with more \npoledancing.\n\n\n\nAnd the groom-to-be always gets a *special* \nbody.\\!\nUsually chosen by the rest of the party.\n\n\n\nAnd as the years pass, you continue to love \nevery minute of it.\\!\nWhat more could you ask for?\n\n\n     Ending 12: Walk a mile in someone \n                    else's heels\n\nPlus, one of the perks of being a manager is\nhaving a range of bodies to switch between.\n\nWork form.\n\n\n\nFun form.\n\n\n\nCuddle form.\n\n\n\nBut what you really start to enjoy is figuring\nout how to use different forms to take your\nmanagement techniques to the next level.\n\nLike boosting your work efficiency.\n\n\n\nOr giving your employees gentle \nencouragement on tough tasks.\\!\n\\C[27]Yes!\\. Go!\\. Write that code!\\.\\.\nSpeed up how fast new maps load!\n\n\n\nPlus, it enables some unconventional, but \n*very* fun new techniques.\n\n\\C[10]Mmmm, if only someone could fix the latest\nduplication glitch. I'm sure they'd get a \n*special* reward.\n\n\n\nIt's no wonder your team keeps voting you\nManager of the Year.\n\n\n    Ending 13: Managing well.\n\nShe gives a disappointed sigh.\n\nI'm sad that you've chosen not to join the \nTerra Games family.\n\nBut I guess it's for the best.\\!\nYou have your own dreams. Your own goals.\\!\nIf you can better fulfill them at another\ncompany then I wish you the best.\n\nAlso, wanting to walk in and beat up the CEO\ntotally goes against our corporate culture.\\!\nYou didn't even make an appointment!\n\nI'm afraid this means I'm going to have to\ndefeat you on his behalf, as properly laid out\nin the corporate responsibilities matrix.\n\nI will give you a moment to prepare.\\!\nTalk to me when you're ready for your defeat.",

It almost looks like his wrinkles\nare starting to fade.\n\nCommunity Volunteer:\nAh, that's the stuff.\n\nAnother drink.\\. His skin is definitely smoothing\nitself out, like time is running backwards. And\nhe seems to be leaning less on his cane.\n\nYou know, I used to help out with the farm,\nbefore these old bones stopped being able to\nhandle it.\n\nHe takes a big stretch. There's a series of \nloud popping noises, and when he relaxes\nhe's easily standing straight.\nHe props his cane up on one shoulder.\n\nDaisy made these back then too. Best things\nI ever tasted.\n\nHe's standing straight now, but he's still just\nas short as when he was hunched over his\ncane. In fact, you think you see him dropping\nanother inch or two as you watch.\n\nHis skin has finished smoothing out to a \nhealthy young texture, seeming to suck \nhis beard back into his face as it goes.\n\nI've missed it, since I moved out to the front.\nDon't want to just stop by and ask for one if\nI'm not helping.\n\nHis face has rounded, any hard lines smoothed\naway.  Meanwhile his clothing has started to\nshift around his body, tightening up to reveal\nslim but fit curves.\n\nBut my old bones just won't take the farm\nwork anymore.\n\nHis cane is changing too, growing longer. The\nend shifts to a silvery color then expands,\nsplitting into four tines and leaving him holding\na pitchfork.\n\nHis clothes have also finished changing, leaving\nhim wearing a set of cow-patterned overalls.\nWith a slight *pop* a straw hat appears over\nhis head and drifts down to a perfect landing.\n\nIt's too bad, I used to love working with the\ncows.\n\nAlways liked spending time around them.\n\nHis hair has also smoothed out, looking glossy\nand healthy as it shifts to a surprisingly\nnatural-looking shade of blue.\n\nTwo strands of hair pull out and morph into\nribbons, tying his lengthening hair back into\ntwin pigtails.\n\nWish I could go back to working on the farm,\nbut my body just can't take it. \\.\\.\n\nShort of a miracle, I'm stuck out here.\n\nHe tilts back his head and drains the last of \nthe milkshake.\nWith each swallow, you can see short horns \nstart to push out of the sides of his head.\n\nA few seconds later, a thin tail flops out of the \nback of the overalls.\nIt swishes back and forth, the tuft of fur on the\nend twitching in the breeze.\n\nFinally as he swallows the last bit of milkshake,\nhis chest begins to soften and swell. And swell.\nTwo round breasts push out the front of his\noveralls, finishing at a nice grapefruit size.\n\nThe new woman finally puts down the cup and\ngives you a smile.\n\nAnyway, look at me going on and on.\n\nThanks for the milkshake friend, it really hit\nthe spot. Why, I feel twenty years younger!\n\nCommunity Volunteer:\nThat's a shame.\nI'd love to sample one of her milkshakes\nagain.",

It almost looks like his wrinkles\nare starting to fade.\n\nCommunity Volunteer:\nAh, that's the stuff.\n\nAnother drink.\\. His skin is definitely smoothing\nitself out, like time is running backwards. And\nhe seems to be leaning less on his cane.\n\nYou know, I used to help out with the farm,\nbefore these old bones stopped being able to\nhandle it.\n\nHe takes a big stretch. There's a series of \nloud popping noises, and when he relaxes\nhe's easily standing straight.\nHe props his cane up on one shoulder.\n\nDaisy made these back then too. Best things\nI ever tasted.\n\nHe's standing straight now, but he's still just\nas short as when he was hunched over his\ncane. In fact, you think you see him dropping\nanother inch or two as you watch.\n\nHis skin has finished smoothing out to a \nhealthy young texture, seeming to suck \nhis beard back into his face as it goes.\n\nI've missed it, since I moved out to the front.\nDon't want to just stop by and ask for one if\nI'm not helping.\n\nHis face has rounded, any hard lines smoothed\naway.  Meanwhile his clothing has started to\nshift around his body, tightening up to reveal\nslim but fit curves.\n\nBut my old bones just won't take the farm\nwork anymore.\n\nHis cane is changing too, growing longer. The\nend shifts to a silvery color then expands,\nsplitting into four tines and leaving him holding\na pitchfork.\n\nHis clothes have also finished changing, leaving\nhim wearing a set of cow-patterned overalls.\nWith a slight *pop* a straw hat appears over\nhis head and drifts down to a perfect landing.\n\nIt's too bad, I used to love working with the\ncows.\n\nAlways liked spending time around them.\n\nHis hair has also smoothed out, looking glossy\nand healthy as it shifts to a surprisingly\nnatural-looking shade of blue.\n\nTwo strands of hair pull out and morph into\nribbons, tying his lengthening hair back into\ntwin pigtails.\n\nWish I could go back to working on the farm,\nbut my body just can't take it. \\.\\.\n\nShort of a miracle, I'm stuck out here.\n\nHe tilts back his head and drains the last of \nthe milkshake.\nWith each swallow, you can see short horns \nstart to push out of the sides of his head.\n\nA few seconds later, a thin tail flops out of the \nback of the overalls.\nIt swishes back and forth, the tuft of fur on the\nend twitching in the breeze.\n\nFinally as he swallows the last bit of milkshake,\nhis chest begins to soften and swell. And swell.\nTwo round breasts push out the front of his\noveralls, finishing at a nice grapefruit size.\n\nThe new woman finally puts down the cup and\ngives you a smile.\n\nAnyway, look at me going on and on.\n\nThanks for the milkshake friend, it really hit\nthe spot. Why, I feel twenty years younger!\n\nCommunity Volunteer:\nThat's a shame.\nI'd love to sample one of her milkshakes\nagain.",

Snakes *love* \nwarmth.\n\nTry to catch her as she comes out the bottom.\n\nHe deftly catches her, even as his shirt shoots\nup past his hands like window blinds.\n\nIt continues to shrink until it's nothing more\nthan a couple bands of cloth wrapping \nnicely-sized breasts.\n\nEmployee:\nIf you really want to let her play, sit down and\nshe'll crawl around your lap!\n\nThe customer, now fully female and partially\nscaley from the waist up, sinks to a sitting \nposition.  \n\nIt's just in time, as her lower half almost\nseems to melt and merge together.\n\nCustomer:\nAww, who's a good snake?\n\nPink scales wash over the rapidly growing pile\nof coils beneath her, even as her pants shrink\nmuch like her shirt did.\n\nShe captures the snake from where she's \ncoiling in her lap and lifts her up for a kiss.\n\nCustomer:\nI'll take her!\\!\nI can already tell we have so much in common!\n\nCustomer:\nI would like to meet a rabbit please!\n\nThe employee vanishes for a moment, then\ncomes back carrying a rabbit in a cage.\n\nEmployee:\nThey can be a little shy, so how about you sit\ndown and let the rabbit come to you.\n\nThe customer kneels down.\\!\nThe employee puts the cage down and opens\nthe door.\n\nCustomer:\nHere bunny! Here bunny!\n\nHe pats his lap.\\!\nThe rabbit hops out of the cage and starts\nsniffing around curiously.\n\nCustomer:\nCome on, don't be afraid.\n\nThe rabbit hesitantly walks up to the customer\nand sniffs his knee.\\!\nThen backs up.\n\nNo one seems to notice his pants snap into\ntights. Or how the waist of his pants cinches\ntight around his stomach, then explodes at\nthe bottom into a dress.\n\nIt's hard to tell, but it looks like his hips popped\noutwards at the same time his stomach pulled\nin.\n\nEmployee:\nI think she likes you!\\!\nTry giving her a pet.\n\nThe customer carefully reaches out to the\nrabbit.\\!\nShe accepts his hand, even as it begins to\nrapidly slim down.\n\nHis shoulders and other hand slim down as\nwell, even as the waistline of his new dress\ncontinues to creep upwards.\n\nUntil it finally fastens itself just below the\nlarge breasts that plump out of his chest.\n\nCustomer:\nAwww, who's a good girl?\n\nHe doesn't seem to notice the rapidly rising\npitch of his voice, or the way his face is \nsoftening along with it.\n\nThough he does have to absently brush his\nmuch longer hair out of the way.\n\nCustomer:\nCome on, don't be scared!\n\nShe pats her lap.\\!\nA pair of bunny ears pop out of the top of her\nhead as she does so, as the changes seem to\ndraw to a close.\n\nEmployee:\nI've never seen her act so friendly!\n\nThe customer smiles down at the bunny as\nshe climbs into her lap.\n\nCustomer:\nI can tell we have a lot in common!\n\nCustomer:\nOh, me too.\\!\nThat's why it's so hard!\n\nThe store employee sighs as the man goes \nback to deliberating.",

They\ncould play together!\n\nEmployee:\nSir, I'd really advise just getting one as\nyour first pet.\n\nA pet is a lot of work to care for, and it's best\nto start with one.\n\nCustomer:\nThat makes sense. I think a bunny, then?\\!\nOr no, a snake?\\!\nOr...\n\nEmployee:\nAre you sure you don't want to hold one of\nthem? That might help you decide.\n\nCustomer:\nNo, no, I would hate to introduce myself to\nthem and then leave them behind!\nIt would be cruel!\n\nEmployee:\nWell, is there anything else I can do to help\nyou choose?\n\nCustomer:\nHmmm...\n\nCustomer:\nOh, I know!\n\nHe turns to you.\n\nCustomer:\nWhich do you like more? Snakes or rabbits?\n\nCustomer:\nWell, there we go!\\!\nI would like to be introduced to your politest\nsnake, please.\n\nThe clerk vanishes for a moment, then comes\nback with a small pink snake.\n\nEmployee:\nI'd like you to meet one of our best-behaved\nyoung corn snakes.\\!\nShe's a real cutie!\n\nShe holds the snake out to him.\n\nEmployee:\nHere, she loves having her head scratched.\n\nThe customer gives a tentative scratch to the\ntop of the snake's head.\n\nThe snake leans into it, seeming to enjoy it \nmore and more as the nails on her head\ngrow out into inch-long claws.\n\nCustomer:\nAww, she really does!\n\nHe doesn't seem to notice as pink scales begin\nto spread down his fingers from the point of\ncontact.\n\nEmployee:\nHere, trying holding her.\nJust hold out your hands.\n\nThe snake immediately starts twining around\nthe customer's fingers.\\!\nBoth hands are now developing a coat of pink\nscales, even as they slim down.\n\nEmployee:\nShe likes to sit on shoulders, too.\nGive it a try!\n\nUsing his significantly more delicate arms,\nthe customer transfers the snake up to his\nshoulders.\n\nThe pink scales have spread all the way up\nto the middle of his upper arms, giving the\nlook of long elegant gloves.\n\nCustomer:\nWow, she really is affectionate!\n\nAs soon as the snake reaches her new perch,\nthe customer's shoulders begin to narrow.\\!\nThis continues while she weaves herself into\na loose necklace around his neck.\n\nHe giggles.\n\nCustomer:\nHey, that tickles!\n\nHe doesn't seem to notice the way his Adam's\napple has just disappeared, or the way his \nvoice shoots up in pitch over the sentence.\n\nHe just keeps watching his slowly rotating \nsnake necklace in delight.\n\nOf course, he has to brush his swiftly \nlengthening, newly blond hair out of his eyes\na time or five.\n\nYou're impressed how easily he avoids\ncatching anything sensitive with the claws now\ntipping his fingers.\n\nHis face is softening as well, eyes growing\nlarger and lips growing fuller.\\!\nCute little patches of scales on the sides add\nthe final touch.\n\nAs the changes slow, he(?) giggles again as\nthe snake slips inside his shirt.\\!\nHis thin forked tongue darting out as he does.\n\nThe clerk laughs.\n\nEmployee:\nOh yeah, she'll do that. Snakes *love* \nwarmth.\n\nTry to catch her as she comes out the bottom.\n\nHe deftly catches her, even as his shirt shoots\nup past his hands like window blinds.\n\nIt continues to shrink until it's nothing more\nthan a couple bands of cloth wrapping \nnicely-sized breasts.\n\nEmployee:\nIf you really want to let her play, sit down and\nshe'll crawl around your lap!\n\nThe customer, now fully female and partially\nscaley from the waist up, sinks to a sitting \nposition.  \n\nIt's just in time, as her lower half almost\nseems to melt and merge together.\n\nCustomer:\nAww, who's a good snake?\n\nPink scales wash over the rapidly growing pile\nof coils beneath her, even as her pants shrink\nmuch like her shirt did.\n\nShe captures the snake from where she's \ncoiling in her lap and lifts her up for a kiss.\n\nCustomer:\nI'll take her!\\!\nI can already tell we have so much in common!\n\nCustomer:\nI would like to meet a rabbit please!\n\nThe employee vanishes for a moment, then\ncomes back carrying a rabbit in a cage.\n\nEmployee:\nThey can be a little shy, so how about you sit\ndown and let the rabbit come to you.\n\nThe customer kneels down.\\!\nThe employee puts the cage down and opens\nthe door.\n\nCustomer:\nHere bunny! Here bunny!\n\nHe pats his lap.\\!\nThe rabbit hops out of the cage and starts\nsniffing around curiously.\n\nCustomer:\nCome on, don't be afraid.\n\nThe rabbit hesitantly walks up to the customer\nand sniffs his knee.\\!\nThen backs up.\n\nNo one seems to notice his pants snap into\ntights. Or how the waist of his pants cinches\ntight around his stomach, then explodes at\nthe bottom into a dress.\n\nIt's hard to tell, but it looks like his hips popped\noutwards at the same time his stomach pulled\nin.\n\nEmployee:\nI think she likes you!\\!\nTry giving her a pet.\n\nThe customer carefully reaches out to the\nrabbit.\\!\nShe accepts his hand, even as it begins to\nrapidly slim down.\n\nHis shoulders and other hand slim down as\nwell, even as the waistline of his new dress\ncontinues to creep upwards.\n\nUntil it finally fastens itself just below the\nlarge breasts that plump out of his chest.\n\nCustomer:\nAwww, who's a good girl?\n\nHe doesn't seem to notice the rapidly rising\npitch of his voice, or the way his face is \nsoftening along with it.\n\nThough he does have to absently brush his\nmuch longer hair out of the way.\n\nCustomer:\nCome on, don't be scared!\n\nShe pats her lap.\\!\nA pair of bunny ears pop out of the top of her\nhead as she does so, as the changes seem to\ndraw to a close.\n\nEmployee:\nI've never seen her act so friendly!\n\nThe customer smiles down at the bunny as\nshe climbs into her lap.\n\nCustomer:\nI can tell we have a lot in common!\n\nCustomer:\nOh, me too.\\!\nThat's why it's so hard!\n\nThe store employee sighs as the man goes \nback to deliberating.",

This is a person.\n\nAny lingering thought that she might just be\nan NPC, might just be a collection of prewritten\nresponses, is fading away.\n\nThere is no way Terra Games would ever have\nwritten dialogue for something like this.

Only one will bless you\nat a time, though you may still deepen your\nconnections to the others while the blessing is\nactive.\n\nIf you wish to activate another blessing, find\nan item that symbolizes that spirit.

Do not be concerned! This card \ndoes not mean mortality, it stands for\n*transformation*.\n\nIt is the ending of some of what you were, in\norder to make way for a new you. \n\nIn the past position it suggests that you have \nbeen through some abrupt and surprising \nchange, but one that makes room for growth\nand renewal.\n\nOf course, it will also depend on what else the\ncards have to tell us. Let us look at the next\npart of your past.\n\nShe draws another card.\n\nFortune Teller:\nAh, the Lovers. It seems there is a connection\nto another that is still troubling you. \n\nThere is someone trying to form a connection\nwith you who has not succeeded, either\nbecause of you or because of them. \n\nThe Lovers can also represent the process of\ngetting clear on your values and beliefs.  \n\nTaken with Death, perhaps there was an \nunexpected change in your past and you are \nstill figuring out how you feel about it.\n\nThe third card of your past should make \nthings more clear.\n\nShe draws another card.\n\nFortune Teller:\nThis\\..\\..\\.. shouldn't be possible?\\!\nPerhaps I mixed up my decks, let me draw\nanother.\n\nShe draws another card.\n\nFortune Teller:\n...\n\nAnd another.\n\n// String of cards here, getting progressively more lewd.\n\nFortune Teller:\nOkay!\\!\nWell!\n\nYou've obviously got some absolute mystical\nbullshit going on here, so I'm getting out\nbefore I get caught up in it!\n\nGood luck to you!\n\nFortune Teller:\nNo refunds.\n\nShe gives you a regretful nod.\n\nFortune Teller:\nNot all are prepared to face the truth.\\!\nBut isn't it better to know?\n\nCome back when you are prepared.",

They say one\nhast not truly known pleasure until they have\nsampled the secret arts of the goddess.\n\nYou wave her off and stagger to bed.

Let us look at the next\npart of your past.\n\nShe draws another card.\n\n\n\nFortune Teller:\nAh, the Lovers. It seems there is a connection\nto another that is still troubling you. \n\nThere is someone trying to form a connection\nwith you who has not succeeded, either\nbecause of you or because of them. \n\nLater cards should tell us how you might \nbuild the connection, or cut them off entirely.\n\nThe Lovers can also represent the process of\ngetting clear on your values and beliefs.  \n\nTaken with Death, perhaps there was an \nunexpected change in your past and you are \nstill figuring out how you feel about it.\n\nThe third card of your past should make \nthings more clear.\n\nShe draws another card.\n\n\n\nFortune Teller:\nThe\\..\\..\\.. Lovers?\\!\nThere shouldn't be another of these in the\ndeck.\n\nBut sometimes things get mixed up, let me\ndraw again.\n\nShe draws another card.\n\n\n\nFortune Teller:\n...\n\nAnd another.\n\n\n\n// String of cards here, getting progressively more lewd.\n\nFortune Teller:\nThis can't be right.\n\n\n\n\n\nFortune Teller:\nI don't even recognize these cards!\n\n\n\nFortune Teller:\nOkay!\\!\nWell!\n\nShe gathers all the cards up with a swift, \ndetermined motion.\n\nFortune Teller:\nI know enough to recognize the signs of some\nabsolute mystical bullshit going on.\n\nGood luck to you, I'm getting the hell out\nbefore I get caught in it.\n\nShe tosses the cards back and heads off\nfor the exit.\n\nFortune Teller:\nNo refunds.\n\nThere's a loud crash from the south.\n\nShe gives you a regretful nod.\n\nFortune Teller:\nNot all are prepared to face the truth.\\!\nBut isn't it better to know?\n\nCome back when you are prepared.",

'Tis but a walk away!\n\nShe strides forward, vanishing underwater.\n\n\\n[2]:\nWe get to see ancient artifacts?\\!\nForgotten lore?\\!\nAquatic wildlife?!?!\n\nCome on \\n[10], let's go!\n\nShe submerges.\n\n\\n[4] shares a look with you.\n\n\\n[4]:\nMaybe something there will help fuzzbrain see\nreason.\\!\n\\}I knew telling her was going to be a pain.\n\nShe sighs.\n\n\\n[4]:\nNo way out but forward, I guess.\n\nShe walks out into the ocean.\n\nWell.\\!\nYou watch for a moment, but none of them\nresurface.\n\nThis must be the water level.\\!\nSometimes having to breathe is a game \nmechanic, but that seems way too complicated\nfor Terra Games to have bothered.\n\nIt must be one where you can just magically\nbreathe underwater, given how everyone \nelse is doing fine.\n\n...They do breathe, right?\\!\nYou'd know if they just didn't need to breathe,\nright?\n\nIt's fine.\\!\nThis is probably-\\. definitely fine.\n\nKaede's head pops out of the water.\n\nKaede:\nHero, why dost thou dally?\\!\nWonder awaits!\n\nShe vanishes under the waves.\\!\nShe was breathing then, right?\\!\nYou're pretty sure you saw her breathing.\n\nYou head towards the water.\\!\nNothing else you can do.\n\nNot like it's the weirdest thing the game has\nhad you do.\n\nHuh, it's wetter than you expected. \\!\nShouldn't this feel magically like air?\n\nStill, there's only so long you can hold your \nbreath.\\!\nYou open your mouth and...\\!\nAnd...\n\nIt's very hard to get yourself to try to breathe\nwater. You pause.\n\nKaede:\nHero, thou art missing out on the wonder to\ncome! Hurry thyself forward!\n\nHer voice sounded totally normal. See, it's \nfine. This is all fine.\n\nYou open your mouth and take just the\nsmallest, tiniest little breath.\n\nYou fling yourself out of the water, coughing\nand retching.\n\nOh god!\\!\nThis was a horrible idea!\\!\nWhy did you try that?!\n\nYour companions follow you out.\n\nKaede:\nWhat hast befallen thee?! What scurrilous \nknave has struck thee down?!\n\nI shouldst have known that no gain coms't\nwithout peril!\n\nShe looks around, searching for a threat.\n\n\\n[2] crouches down next to your\ncoughing form.\n\n\\n[2]:\nDid you... try to breathe the water?\\!\nAre you okay?\n\n\\n[4]:\nHah! As if anyone would be so moronic!\\!\nEven babies know better!\n\nI could see maybe fuzzbrain trying, but no\none else would.\n\nKaede:\nCease thy nonsense! We must be on guard\nfor the source of this attack!\n\nYou were just trying to follow them!\\!\nHow can they breathe underwater and you\ncan't?!\n\nKaede:\nBreathe underwater?\n\nNay, mine command of mine own form meanst\nthat I might borrow the gills of a fish at the\nmerest whim.\n\n\\n[4] rolls her eyes.\n\n\\n[4]:\nSpirits don't breathe, idiot!\n\n\\n[2] shrugs.\n\n\\n[2]:\nMagic?\n\nMagic?\n\n\\n[2]:\nMagic.\n\nFine.\\!\nWhatever.\n\nYou still need some way to get to the sunken\ntemple.\n\nKaede:\nI couldst perhaps teach you deep piscine \nsecrets, but it wouldst require the effort of\nyears.\n\n\\n[4]:\nWhy are you looking at me?\\!\nNo one here is going to let me do anything\nthat might turn you into a spirit.\n\n\\n[2]:\nMagic would be much less terminal than that,\nyes. But I can't cast the spell on others.\n\nAnd you've shown no signs of the magical\ntalent that would let you learn it yourself.\n\nKaede shrugs.\n\nKaede:\nWell. Then I shalt call upon the followers of the\ngoddesses, and with time they shouldst bring\nthe temple once more above the waves.\n\nIt might be the work of many years, but in\ntime you too shalt know of their glory!\n\nLet us keep that blessed day forever in our\nthoughts, as we stride forth to be sure the\nfuture shall come!\n\n\\n[4]:\nOh no.\\!\nNo way are you getting away that easily.\n\nKaede:\nWhat nonsense hast now lodged itself in thy\nbrain?\n\n\\n[4]:\nIf I had to face the ugly stupid truth then \nthere's *no way* I'm letting you live with your\nstupid delusions.\n\nYou understand where she's coming from, but\nwhat does she think she can do?\n\n\\n[4]:\nWe are going to find a way into her *stupid*\ntemple and rub her face in the truth.\n\nKaede:\nThou thinkest that showing me the greatest \nwonders of the goddesses wilt shake mine\nfaith?\n\nShe laughs scornfully.\\!\nWow, she's got the hand up and the whole \nanime ojou-sama thing going on.\n\n\\n[4] rolls her eyes.\n\n\\n[4]:\nOh please, the horny idiots who *actually*\nmade us wouldn't know wonder if it bit them\non the dick. \n\n\\}It kind of did bite them on the Dick, come \nto think of it.\n\nIf we get in there it's going to be *at best* a \npile of worthless horny garbage. \\!\nI'm sure the truth will be *very* clear.\n\nKaede rolls her eyes.\n\nKaede:\nOf course, thou hast another scheme.\\!\nHast thou not learned that all of thy plans give\nthee naught but humiliation?\n\nWhatever thou art planning here will give thee\nnothing but the same, or worse if thou darest\nto harm a single of the treasures inside.\n\nShe crosses her arms.\n\nKaede:\nBut tell us, if thou art so determined, how\ndost thou plan to get the hero inside?\\!\n*Unharmed*, mindest thou.\n\nKaede:\nWell?\n\n\\n[4]:\nQuiet!\n\nShe holds out a hand.\n\n\\n[4]:\nI am planning! Genius cannot be rushed!\n\nAs the two bicker, you realize that you've been\nhearing \\n[2] muttering something for\na while.\n\nLooking over, she has her head bowed over\nher joined hands.\n\n\\n[2]:\n\\}-and I entreat you once more oh great \ngoddesses, please grant us your strength \nand power to overcome this trial.\n\n\\}Because obviously no one else here can. \nAmen.\n\nShe looks up.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nDarlings, having trouble on your beach day?\\!\nDon't worry, your goddess is here to help!\n\nGoddess Fittina:\nDude, hero, I'm here too!\\!\nDid I hear something about breathing?\n\nWe'll figure out how to make your lung \nmuscles the swollest you've ever seen!\n\nGoddess Hadea:\nI'm here too I guess.\n\n\\n[2]:\n...Goddess Earth says she's busy.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nSo darlings, how can we help?\n\nYou all explain.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nNo! Really?\\!\nShe can't breathe water at all?!\n\nKaede:\nI know, 'tis such a simple task! And yet we\nmust call upon thy power to permit it!\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nWell, we can certainly take care of that for you\nhero \\n[10]!\n\nShe taps her finger thoughtfully against her\nlips. \n\nGoddess Florauna:\nIt will take some work on your part, but I'm\nsure you'll be just wonderful at it!\n\nGoddess Fittina:\nYeah dude, gotta make sure we're not \noverworking ourselves with you and leaving\nnothing to fight the dark goddess.\n\nYou all try to ignore Hadea going \"ka-ching!\" \nin the background.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nFor me to be able to grant my blessing, I shall\nrequire a sign, an absolutely wonderful \nsymbol of the union of earth and sea!\n\nA sign of how humanity has learned to not \njust tolerate life among the waves, but to\nthrive!\nTo play and gambol amongst them!\n\nKaede:\nGoddess, if I read thine portents rightly, thou\nart requesting...\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nYes, a swimsuit!\\!\nBut not just any swimsuit.\n\nWell, I guess that any old swimsuit would work,\ndarling, but where's the fun in that?\\!\nI want you to pick something fun! Something\nfashionable!\n\nThe sort of thing you'd love to see everyone\nwearing if you could!\n\nGoddess Hadea:\nFor my blessing, you must commune with the\nspirits!\n\nYou and \\n[4] trade glances.\\!\nYou wave.\n\nGoddess Hadea:\nNo, not those spirits!\n\nSomeone's already setting up a bar nearby,\nand I'm a big fan of how they've jumped on \nthis moneymaking opportunity.\n\nBut their bartender can't make it and they \nneed someone to fill in. \\!\nGo give them a hand.\\!\nAnd of course, earn some money!\n\nGoddess Fittina:\nHey dude, you should go get some cardio.\\!\nReally get that blood pumping.\n\nThere's a volleyball game getting started that\nI think you'll love.\\!\nIt'll totally help you get a beach body!\n\nThe other goddesses give her a look.\n\nGoddess Fittina:\nWhich, uh, has deep spiritual meaning?\n\nOh, the sports symbolize sports! And exercise\nis exercise!\n\nNo, no, I got it! You really gotta commune \nwith your heart! Get that cardio going!\n\nKaede:\nCome bold \\n[10]!\\!\nWe shouldst dally not on such divine quests!",

He takes\na sip anyway.\n\nGerome Devillers:\nUgh, just as bad as I expected.\n\nHe takes another sip.\n\nGerome Devillers:\nWell, at least I can tell you made a bit of an\neffort. This at least has a little spice.\n\nBut could you choose something less cliche\nthan cinnamon?\n\nAnother sip.\n\nGerome Devillers:\nArtificial cinnamon, too. Not to mention that \nawful, *awful* sweet undertaste.\\!\nBleh.\n\nIn fact, I take it back. You made a bit of an \neffort, but I asked for *dark*. This is nothing \nlike I ordered. \n\nHow are you failing at service *and* flavor?\nIs it too much to ask that you be competent\nat even a single facet of serving drinks?!\n\nWith each sip he's getting more and more\nheated, not noticing the changes that are\nstarting to ripple through him.\n\nGerome Devillers:\nSomehow I find it more offensive that you\nclearly *tried*.\n\nGetting it completely wrong could just be \nignorance, but that tiny bit of effort just\nreveals your complete and total \nincompetence!\n\nHe- or at this point more likely she- is getting\nmore and more flushed with each complaint \nshe heaps upon your head, even as her body\ngrows softer and curvier.\n\nGerome Devillers:\nSome of the worst\\.- mmm!\\.- service I have\never received!\n\nOne hand has crept up to knead a still-growing\nbreast, even as she breathes more heavily\nwith each insult.\n\nGerome Devillers:\nIntolerable!\\.

You should be \nashamed to do this to perfectly good alcohol.\n\nAnother sip. He has to chase his face with the\nglass a little, as his lips are moving while his\nface shrinks into something much more cute\nand feminine.\n\nGerome Devillers:\nI keep drinking it just to see if it’s as bad as I \nremember.\n\nAnother sip, accompanied by a loud creaking\nnoise as his shirt suddenly strains to contain\na swelling mass of breast flesh.\n\nGerome Devillers:\nIt's worse.\n\nAnother sip, with more creaking noises.\n\nGerome Devillers:\nYou know, at this point I think I’m just \ndrinking it so that the next thing I taste \nwill be wonderful in comparison.\n\nNo matter what it is.\\!\nRaw sewage would be a pleasant contrast.\n\nAnother sip.

You're pretty\nsure it was at the tops of your ears before,\nbut it's touch the bottoms now.\n\nYour hair is definitely getting longer. Even\nwithout the mirror, you can see your bangs\nstarting to come into view.\n\nYour bangs are starting to get into your eyes\nas your hair inches its way down to \nchin-length. It's not a big problem yet, but\nyou can tell where it's going.\n\nYou also think it's gotten a little fuller.  And\ndefinitely a little more shiny.\n\nYou're constantly having to brush your hair\nout of your face as it flops in front of your\neyes. Your bangs have grown down to the\ntip of your nose, and it's longer in the back.\n\nYou can see that your hair has reached \nchin-length in the back.\n\nYou thought your bangs were a pain before,\nbut now they're long enough to start getting\nin your mouth. No matter how often you pull\nthem back, they just flop forward.\n\nYour hair has also started to pick up a gentle\nwave.\n\nJust when you think your hair is as annoying \nas it's going to get, it gets worse.\\.\\. Now it's long \nenough to reach your chin in front but not long \nenough to tuck behind your ears. \n\nWhenever you turn your head too fast it flies \ninto your eyes and mouth again.\n\nYour hair has grown down to your shoulders, \nlong enough that it's started to be controllable \nagain.\\. It also looks richer and shinier then it \nused to.\n\nYour hair has gotten longer and thicker again,\nflowing down in rich, soft waves to a few\ninches below your shoulders.\n\nYour hair has grown again, now reaching \ndown to the small of your back. \n\nIt seems to be growing thicker as well; \nthere's so much that it actually flares out a bit \naround your shoulders, giving your face a \nbackdrop of hair.\n\nIt's less trouble than you thought it would be. \nYou've heard about tangles, but you can't feel \nanything like that when you run your fingers \nthrough it. \n\nMaybe those aren't what you thought. If they\nexisted, you'd think you'd have them by now.\n\nYou look at your hair. It's long enough now\nyou'd be a little surprised to see it on someone\nwalking by, reaching down to the top of your\nhips.\n\nIt flows smoothly behind you as you move, \nalmost like a soft silky cloak.\n\nYou're dreading the point where it gets long \nenough for you to accidentally sit on it.\n\nAnd how hard is it to wash this much hair?\n\nYour hair falls in smooth silky waves all the \nway to the top of your ass. You expected it to \nbe a hassle to deal with, getting caught in \nthings, but somehow it hasn’t been a problem. \n\nYou smile at how many other people would\nlove to have hair that was this convenient.\n\nThis really is turning out to be an amazing\nexperience.\n\nIt hasn't been a problem besides making you\nlook like you wanted your hair to be this long,\nthat is.\n\nYou spend a moment dreaming of scissors and\nclippers.\n\nYou have hair longer than anyone you’ve \never seen, falling all the way to the bottom of \nyour ass. \n\nYet somehow it’s remained smooth and \nmanageable, falling in soft waves to flare out \nat the bottom almost to the width of your hips. \n\nSomehow it even spreads out enough to cover\nyour massive rear.\n\nIt’s gotten much thicker than it was before, but \nnot enough to hide your absolutely enormous \nbooty.\n\nEvery so often you notice your hands moving \non their own to keep your hair from being sat \non or caught in something.\\.\nIt's so practical!\n\nYour hands keep trying to move your hair \naround without your input. \\. \nYou can’t help from snatching them away \nevery time you notice. \n\nThis has had…\\.\\. predictable consequences.\\. \nGetting your hair caught in a door hurts. So \ndoes sitting on it the wrong way.\n\nYour hair has continued to grow. It reaches \nnearly to your knees now, flaring out in a soft \ncurtain around you visible from the front. \n\nYou still find your hands keeping it out of the \nway. Sometimes you catch yourself brushing \nit with a brush you didn’t know you had and \ncan’t find later. It’s surprisingly relaxing.\n\nAnd you love how stunning your hair is. \\.\nNo one has hair like this. \\.\nNo one except you. \n\nYou wish you could at least ignore it, but you\ncan see it out of the corner of your eyes,\nconstantly taunting you with its presence.\n\nMaybe you could tie it back. But you don't\nknow how.\\. You have so much hair now that \nit's hard to wrap both hands around it when \nyou gather it together.\n\nYou've heard of hair ties, but you don't think\nthey make them this big.\n\nYour hair ripples in huge waves down your \nback all the way to your ankles. You have \ntrouble believing the image in the mirror\ncould possibly be a real person.  \n\nYour absurd proportions just add to the \nunreality of it all.\n\nYour absurd proportions just add to the \nunreality of it all.\n\nBut the weight on your scalp, the silken feeling\nof your hair constantly sliding over your skin,\ntell you that this is real.\\. \nIt's real and it's you.\n\nYou’ve noticed your hands are having to \nspend a lot more time maneuvering your hair \naround, but it works. \n\nSomehow it’s always smoothly flowing around \nyou, avoiding all possible obstacles.\n\nIt's almost superhuman how good you are at\nthis.\\.\nIt's another thing to love about what's \nhappening to you.\n\nIt’s still deeply disturbing that your hands are \nmoving without your control to manage your \nhair. \n\nYou’re still trying to stop your hands whenever \nyou notice. This often results in painful or \nembarrassing situations, but at least you’re \nstill controlling yourself.\n\nGiven that the alternative is for it to be \nexactly as impractical as you’d expect \nankle-length hair to be, you’re grudgingly \nsubmitting.\n\nYou think your hair has grown again, but it’s \nhard to tell. At some point it restyled itself into \na simple braid that still reaches down to your \nankles. \n\nYour hair would probably reach the floor if you \ntook it out of the braid, but it’s much easier to \nmanage like this.\n\nThis is new.\\.\nYou spend a moment daydreaming of all the\nprettier styles that might appear next.\\.\\.\nYour new hair is so great!\n\nIt's not obvious, but your hair has grown \nagain. It’s now in a thick braid that reaches \ndown to your ankles, but brushes the floor if \nyou unbraid it.  \n\nWhich you did as soon as you noticed.\\.\nBut as soon as you got distracted the braid \nwas back. \n\nAre your hands doing that and you just \nhaven’t noticed? \\.\nHow could you not notice all the effort that \nwould take?\n\nYour hair has gotten fancier compared to the\nsimple braid it was in before.\\.\nNot much fancier, but now it's braided into \nmultiple plaits that are also braided together.\n\nA little crown of braids completes the look.\n\nYour attention wanders for a moment while \nyou picture other cute ways you might do your \nhair. \n\nLooking back up, you catch your hands \nexpertly reweaving your hair into something \nlike what you just pictured. \n\nYou still don’t know what you’re doing, but \napparently your hands do! All you need to do \nis picture a new style, and they’ll automatically \nstart making it. \n\nIt’s so convenient!\n\nIt’s likely your hair has grown again, because \nthe new hairstyle again falls to your ankles.\n\nYou’ve tried to take the braids out, but it’s \nhard. It takes much longer do undo this group \nof braids than the simple braid took. \n\nSeveral times you’ve gotten distracted partway \nthrough and found your hands just finishing \nfixing everything when you looked back. \n\nYou’ve managed to fully undo it a few times, \nbut it makes moving so much harder. \\.\nLeft loose, you’re dragging what must be a \nfoot of hair on the ground as you walk. \n\nYou can gather up your hair, but there's so\nmuch now it takes both arms to carry it. And \nit keeps flopping in front of your eyes and \nkeeping you from seeing.\n\nWhich is even more of a pain when both your\nhands are busy carrying it.\n\nYour hair is done up in an elaborate hairstyle, \nfull of loops and braids. Even with all the fancy \ndesigns it still falls all the way down to your \nankles, and it flares out well past your hips.  \n\nYou’ve maybe seen hair this elaborate once or \ntwice before, when you glanced at pictures of \nmovie stars and models dressing up for awards.\n\nBut even they didn’t have the sheer length of \nhair you do, length that lets the designs get \nmore and more elaborate.  \n\nYou’re pretty sure if you let your hair down \nfully it would trail for feet behind you on the \nground.\n\nYou're amazed that it's your hands that have\ncreated all this, too. The level of skill you've\ngained for free is breathtaking.\n\nYou don’t even have to picture a hairstyle to \nstart them working anymore. You can just \nthink “fancier” or “simpler”, \"casual\" or \n\"sexy\", and they’ll create something perfect.\n\nYou’ve nearly given up trying to undo your \nhairstyle. \\.\nIt’s so elaborate you’re having trouble figuring \nout where to start. \n\nAnd even if you were able to let it all down, \nyou have just so much hair that you’d barely \nbe able to manage walking.\n\nStill, you’re at least trying to pull out the \nfanciest pieces whenever you can. It’s a \nconstant battle since it keeps reworking itself \nwhenever you’re not paying attention.\n\nYour hair reaches to your ankles. That’s the \nonly thing that’s stayed the same as before.\n\nBut now it's styled in such an elaborately \ncomplicated manner that it makes the \nhairstyles you had before look like bed \nhair.\n\nIt's full of loops and braids and coils and a \nthousand other things that you don’t even \nknow the name for.  \n\nIt puffs out around you in a massive cloud of \nsilky decoration that spreads out for nearly \nthe width of your body on either side.  \n\nYou don’t know how long it must have gotten \nto be this elaborate and still reach your ankles.\\. \nHalf again your height? Double your height?\n\nYou just know that it’s the most elegant thing \nyou’ve ever seen.  \\.\\.\\.\nThe most elegant thing anyone will ever see. \n\nNo one who hasn’t been blessed like you have \ncould possibly have hair this long, styled this \nbeautifully, that’s this easy to manage. \n\nAnd whenever your hands are free, you find \nyourself plaiting and reweaving and making it\never more beautiful.  \n\nThis is it.\\. This is the greatest hair could ever\nbe.\n\nYou’d love to undo this mess.\\. You’re trying.\\. \nMost of what you’re accomplishing is to at \nleast keep your hands from constantly \nredoing your hair into other elaborate styles.  \n\nAt this point, you almost consider it a victory \nwhen you have the same hairstyle when you \nlook in the mirror as you did the last time you \nlooked.\n\n// Trend as hair gets longer:\nShinier\nLonger (of course)\nWavier and fuller\nWhen it gets long enough it's wider than the shoulders, but \nsomehow seems to keep itself styled so it's always a long glossy\n\n// flow.  When it gets below butt-length there's a check to see size of \nbutt.  If large enough, can have a comment like \"would be around \nyour knees if it wasn't pooling on top of your enormous shelf of an \nass.\"\n\n// Once it starts getting down to ground level (check for heels?) then \nit starts tying itself up in increasingly more elaborate hairstyles to \nstay off the ground.  You have no idea how they work.  \n\"Your attention wanders for a moment while you wonder how \nyou're going to handle washing them or going to bed.\nYou catch yourself expertly tying off a braid, having unconsciously\n\n// unwoven it and changed it to a different style while you were \nthinking.  \n(If resistence high) You yank your hands away from your hair.  The \nnext time you look, the braid has rewoven itself, though you don't \nremember doing that.\n(Future looks) Your braids have shifted again. Are you doing that?\n\n// (If acceptance high)Your attention wanders, and you suddenly \nnotice yourself humming lightly and reweaving your hair into a \ndifferent pattern.  You still don't know what you're doing, but \napparently your hands do.\nYou think about letting down your hair, and they start unbraiding it.\n\n// You think about making it fancier, and your hands start coiling it up \ninto an elaborate crown.  \nLooks like even if you don't consciously know what you're doing, \nit's not a problem.  Nice!\n\n// (Future looks, high acceptance)As soon as you glance at your \nenormously long glossy hair, your hands start neatening it up.  \nYou've noticed you've been unconsciously moving it around, too, \nwhich means you've had much less problems than someone with \nhair longer than you're tall should.  Nice!\n\nYour hair has also turned a striking teal.\\!\nIt... feels like a dream you had?",

Instead you're staring at everything \nfrom lowered lids, which is giving you a \nslightly sultry look.\n\nYour voice has started to drop again. But it's \nnot sounding masculine, just throaty. Your \nlips have swelled to match it, almost \nbee-stung now.\n\nYou see a face that's still cute, but no longer \ninnocent.  Your constant blushes have faded \ninto more like a constant flush of arousal. \n\nIt fits with your lowered eyes, which can't \nseem to help giving sultry glances no matter \nwhat expression you have.\n\nYou give yourself an inviting glance in the \nmirror.

Like \nyour swollen lips, which you find yourself \nconstantly licking.\n\nYou seem to have two types of expression \nleft: like you're thinking about sex and like \nyou're experiencing it. \n\nYou don't just smile anymore; you moan, you \nlick your lips, and you flush even redder. \nYou've got a phone sex voice that could \nmake reading the dictionary erotic. \n\nYou try not to listen to yourself, because it \nturns you on.\n\nYou love listening to yourself talk. Your voice\nis so sexy it turns you on.  And the idea of \nhow everyone else responds is even better.\n\nYou see a face that looks built for nothing \nother than sex staring back at you.  Your \nhuge lips, so swollen they can't even close \ncompletely, look made for sucking.  \n\nYou moan at the slightest sensation on your \nsensitive mouth, especially when you keep \nlicking your enormous lips.  \n\nIt just adds to the constant flush of arousal \non your face.",

Lipstick, mascara, blush, all sorts\nof things you've heard of but not tried seem\nto have been professionally applied to you.\n\nNo matter how much you rub, it doesn't\nchange. It doesn't even seem to make your\nskin red or raw; that would be too much of a \ndisturbance to your face.\n\nIt's striking and brings out your face perfectly.\nA few tentative tests show you that it won't rub\noff or run either. \n\nYou'll always look this good with no effort.\nNice.\n\nIt's striking and really brings out your face.\nBut it's not something you ever expected to \nsee on yourself.\n\nYour makeup is hovering just at the edge of\nbeing too much. It's unusual, but you have to\nadmit it's incredibly striking.\n\nYour face has a traditional look. Glossy red \nlipstick, expertly blended eyeshadow and \nblush, dark full eyelashes. Your skin looks\nabsolutely flawless.\n\nYou look very Goth. Your lips are shiny and \nblack, which contrasts sharply against your\nlightened skin. Your eyes are also outlined in\nblack, swirling out from the outside corners.\n\nIt looks like your current makeup is themed\nafter mermaids. Your lips are coated in deep\nsparkling blue, and a light blue shades your\neyelids.\n\nTraces of iridescent glitter sparkle over the\nrest of your face, over a faint bluish\nundertone. More blue has been used to give\nthe faint impression of scales on your cheeks.\n\nPink appears to be the theme. Your lips are\ncoated in bright bubblegum pink, with more of\nthe intense color shading your eyes. Somehow\neven your eyelashes have been colored pink.\n\nWait, have your eyes changed color too?\n\nIt looks like your irises are now also a bright\npink, a few shades different to contrast.\n\nAnd of course, pink glitter everywhere. Your\nlips, your cheeks, your eyelids, your hair.\nEven your eyes seem to glitter when you\nstare at them.\n\nRainbow is the theme. Your eyelids show a \nwhole rainbow of colors, spreading out in a \nbright splash of color past your eyes.\n\nYou're not even sure if your lipstick should be\npossible. It shifts seamlessly from red on the\nleft to purple on the right.\n\nEven your eyes have changed.

Your glasses helpfully chime\nin to say you now have A-cup breasts. Why\nis that a feature?!\n\nYour cute B-cups press against your shirt\nwhenever you straighten up.\n\nBinding should still be able to hide them.\n\nYou could bind them, but why would you \nwant to?\n\nYou look at your C-cup breasts.  They're \ndefinitely getting to be a full handful of soft\nflesh.\n\nIt's getting harder to think of ways to hide \nthem.\n\nThey're really starting to show themselves\noff, straining against your shirt.\n\nYou look down to your D-cup breasts, pushing\nproudly against your shirt.\n\nYou like firm breasts, but not on you!\n\nThey're a beautiful shape, nice and firm.\nAnd you can tell clearly you're not wearing a\nbra.\n\nYou squeeze your arms together and blow the\nmirror a kiss, looking at the deep line of\ncleavage it makes.  \nLooking good.\n\nYour phone informs you that you now have\nDD-cup breasts. Firm, round, jiggly DD-cup\nbreasts. You're starting to understand why\nsports bras exist. Or bras in general, really.\n\nThe two masses pulling your shirt taut are\napparently E-cups. You feel like they should\nbe making your back hurt, but somehow you\nstill feel fine.\n\nYou heft your huge F-cup breasts and \nwonder how much bigger they're going to\nget.\n\nYou could deal with the size if they\nweren't also so sensitive!\n\nThese are nice, but a little bigger and you\ncould *really* draw some attention.\n\nYour breasts have grown again, reaching \nmassive G-cups. It takes two hands now for\nyou to cover one boob.\n\nThe only bright spot is that your clothes seem\nto be growing with your massive chest.\nSomehow you're still covered.\n\nYour shirt has grown too, continuing to fit\nsnugly to your eye-catching breasts.\n\nAs it's grown the neckline has dropped,\nshowing the dark line of your swelling \ncleavage.

At least, you've never\nseen anyone with breasts as large as your\nJ-cups before.\n\nYou need to use both hands now to lift one of\nyour enormous K-cup breasts. Not that you\ndo. They've gotten so sensitive you try to\navoid touching them as much as possible.\n\nAt least in public. You sneak a quick glance\naround and then give them a jiggle.\n\nOooooh, that feels so goooooood.\n\nYour breasts are so huge now that you're \nnot sure you'd notice a little more growth,\nbut your phone chimes in helpfully to tell you\nyou're now the owner of lovely L-cup breasts.\n\nYou were wrong. You're pretty sure your \nbreasts weren't covering your stomach this\nmuch before. It's almost hidden behind your\nM-cups in the mirror.\n\nYour N-cup breasts protrude over a foot in \nfront of you. You're still figuring out how to\npick things up without knocking them over\nwith your massive boobs.\n\nSomehow your O-cup breasts are still\nperfectly shaped, still jiggling whenever you\nmove, still firm and proud.

It's actually kind of \nrelaxing. You can pillow your head on them \nand let your legs take their weight for a while\n\nYour S-cup breasts have grown to the point\nwhere they'd hide your crotch if you walked \naround bottomless. Somehow you're still\nnot having trouble walking. Magic?\n\nYour T-cup breasts are now so big you can't\ntell if you have a vagina or not from the front.\nThat's something? Though the incredibly \nmassive boobs will draw enough stares.\n\nYour phone informs you that you now have\nU-cup breasts. All you can tell is that it's\nstarting to be a challenge to reach your\nnipples.\n\nYour V-cup breasts are just ridiculously huge.\nThey cover almost two feet of your body.\nWith breasts this wide, you're starting to have\nsome trouble with doors.\n\nYou have to position your breasts carefully\nto squeeze through. You've forgotten a few\ntimes and bounced painfully off. At least,\nyou're pretending it's only pain you felt.\n\nSomehow you're carrying W-cup breasts, \nwider than most doors. You try to ignore the\nsensations from your ever more sensitive\nbreasts as you squeeze through.\n\nYou actually have to back up to see all of \nyour X-cup boobs in the mirror. They should\nweigh more then the rest of you, but you're \nstill mobile with just slightly sore shoulders.\n\nYou can't even pretend to go through doors\nnormally with your Y-cup breasts anymore.\nThey're at least double the width of your\ntorso. \n\nYou have to push and squeeze them one at\na time until one pops through the frame, then\nwork on the other one. It's an ordeal.\n\nSomehow you've reached a Z-cup, as your\nglasses helpfully inform you. You're pretty\ncertain no one else has ever been this busty.\nYour breasts reach down to your knees.\n\nMaybe your breasts will stop growing now\nthat you've run out of alphabet?\n\nYour glasses helpfully tell you that your\nmindblowingly massive tits are now ZZ-cups.\nApparently there's more alphabet to go.\n\nYou stare at your ZZZ-cup boobs. They're so\nlarge that you have to be careful walking. If\nyou swing your foot too far forward, you kick\nyourself in the boob.\n\nYou hope that your breasts have finally \nstopped growing. You were already having\ntrouble with doors; a little more and you'll\nstart having trouble with halls.\n\nAt least it looks like you've maxed out \nwhatever function is telling you your breast\nsize.

It's started\nto add a bit of a natural sway into your walk.\n\nThankfully, you've found that you can still walk\nnormally. Pick up leg, swing it straight forward,\nput it down, repeat. It's not hard.\n\nYou're kind of enjoying the new sensation. It's\nnot much different, but it's interesting to feel \nhow something as simple as walking is\nchanging as your body does.\n\nYour hips have widened another inch or so.\nYou've still got relatively average hips (for\na woman), but you're starting to edge into \nabove-average. \n\nAnd you've gotten just a bit more sway in your\nnatural gait.\n\nYour hips have progressed, widening into\nproudly curvy regions. They're not incredibly \nwide, but you can't deny you have a obviously \ncurvy figure.\n\nIt's getting harder to walk normally. Your hips\nare wide enough now that your natural gait\nis very feminine, rolling from hip to hip.\n\nYou still try to keep walking like you used to,\nbut every so often you realize you've forgotten\nand have been swaying your way down the\nstreet for a while.\n\nYou've developed a definite sway to your walk,\neach rolling step reminding you of your \nnoteworthy hips. It's a good feeling.\n\nYour walk has also grown more feminine,\nswaying from side to side as you move.\n\nYour hips have widened again into large\nchild-bearing curves. \n\nSqueezing your legs together, you realize that \nyou can't feel your thighs touch. Your hips \nhave grown so wide that you've developed a \nsmall thigh gap!\n\nYour child-bearing hips have continued to grow, \nadding even more of a rolling sway to your\nwalk.\n\nYou've been trying to continue walking \nnormally, though you've had to remind \nyourself how with almost every step.\n\nBut this last spurt of growth has made it nearly\nimpossible. You try again, picking up one foot\nand trying to swing it straight forward.\n\nYour hip joint seizes up, bone and tendon \ncomplaining as you try to force it to do \nsomething your body is no longer built to do.\n\nIt's only when you relax a little and let your\nhips sway that your foot can finally move\nforward.\n\nYou're still resolved to minimize that sway,\neven if you can no longer eliminate it \ncompletely.\n\nIt's given you somewhat of a confident sexy\nstrut, one that you enjoy sometimes \nexaggerating as much as you can to see others'\nreactions.\n\nYour hips have grown again.

It\nwouldn't surprise you if you're currently in\npossession of some of the widest hips on\nthe planet.\n\nYou can almost fit your fist between your\nthighs, even when you're trying to close your \nlegs.\n\nAnd your walk is a swaying production, \nthrusting one hip out to the side as you shift\nyour weight, then the other.\n\nSomehow, somehow, your hips have grown\nonce again. These have to be the biggest in the\nworld. They have to be the biggest that have\never existed.\n\nThey stretch out more than twice the width of \nyour shoulders. Your thigh gap has grown so\nwide that you can fit your entire fist under your\ncrotch with room to spare.\n\nAnd your thighs don't actually touch until \nnearly your knees.\n\nEach step you take can and has caused\naccidents, thrusting your hips almost a foot to \nthe side as you roll from one foot to the next. \n\nThe sway in your walk is almost enough to\nmake you seasick as you frantically try to \nwatch both your sides at once.\n\nYou still find yourself smashing your hips into\nwalls and knocking things off tables as you try\nto adjust to just how much space you need for\nyour impossible curves.\n\nSomehow, despite the fact your hips almost\ntake up a whole hallway when you walk, you're\nnot having much trouble navigating.\n\nYou can barely even see your hips past your\nenormous breasts, but somehow you're still\nmanaging to move around almost as easily\nas you could before.\n\nYou seem to have an instinctive sense where\nto put your overexaggerated body to cause the\nleast amount of trouble. This game is so\nconvenient!\n\nYou're still getting used to navigating with a \nbody that nearly takes up an entire hallway\nwhen you walk, but it's somehow not as\ndifficult as you would expect.\n\nYou're still bumping into things, still sweeping\nthings off tables with your massive hips, but \nwhen you relax and just try to move normally\nit just kind of works.\n\nRelaxing and moving normally is the problem.\nIt's hard to forget that you have hips wider\nthan some couples put together. And that's\nwhen accidents happen.\n\nYour mammoth chest is happy to join in every\ntime you take a swaying step, jiggling \neverywhere.\n\nYour large breasts get in on the action too,\neach rolling step sending them bouncing back\nand forth.\n\nThe impact of your swaying strut is vastly\nmagnified by your absolutely enormous ass.\n\nEvery step sends earthquakes of jiggling\nthrough your butt, each cheek jumping up and\ndown nearly as far as your hips sway side to\nside.\n\nYour rolling strut also draws attention to your\nrespectable butt, each cheek very clearly \njerking up and down with every step.\n\nYou've heard of figures that can cause \naccidents. \\.\n\nYou passed that long ago.\n\nYou're pretty sure you've seen some people \nfaint dead away when they've come around a \ncorner and been unexpectedly confronted with\nyour impossible curves.",

You adjust them.\n\nLooking at yourself from the side, your butt\nmight be sticking out a little more than usual?\nIt's usually pretty flat, but now there might\nbe a slight curve.\n\nYou're definitely starting to get some slight\ncurves in the back. It's still not odd for a guy,\nbut your ass definitely is sticking out more\nthank it used to.\n\nYour pants are starting to get a little tight. You\nwant to say nothing's changed, but you're \nstarting to see notable swelling in back.\n\nYour ass has grown out into a respectable size.\nIt's nothing huge. It would be a cute, pert ass\non a woman. But it's definitely bigger than you\nhad before.\n\nThere's no denying it, no hiding it, your butt\nhas grown out to a respectable size.  It's still\nabout average for a woman, but you can feel\nthe extra layers of padding whenever you sit.\n\nYou butt is definately making a run for an\nhourglass figure. It's not super huge, but it is\nunmistakably feminine.\n\nYou might admire it if it wasn't on *you*.\n\nYou've got to admit, it's looking pretty good.\n\nYour ass has grown out into a nice big bubble.\nYou're still suprised by just how far it jutts out\nbehind you, and how soft it feels when you sit.\n\nYour ass has continued to grow. Reaching\nback, you can feel your fingers just sink into\nit as you squeeze. \n\nIt's big enough you know you'd do a \ndoubletake if you saw it on anyone except\nyourself.\n\nYou're just hoping no one else pays it that\nmuch attention.\n\nYou can't help but feel a little proud at all the\nattention it's going to draw.\n\nYour ass is, in a word, huge. Ridiculous. It \njiggles with every step you take, and makes\nit feel like you're always sitting on a cushion.\n\nSomehow your clothing keeps stretching to\ncover it.  Though it's getting pulled nearly\nskin-tight across your gigantic juicy rear.\n\nYou think you may have seen an ass this big\nbefore.  Maybe. Never in person, but maybe a\ncelebrity known for their massive rear might\nmatch you.\n\nYou're pretty sure you have one of the largest\nbooties in the world at this point.\n\nYou wish there was some way to hide it, but\nany cloth you put over it is just going to drape\noff the end and outline how huge it is.\n\nYou feel a little thrill of anticipation. This is an\nass you could build a career on, and who\nknows how much farther you can go?\n\nYour ass is enormous. It sticks out farther\nfrom your back than the width of your torso,\nfront to back.  \n\nYou give it an experimental slap, and watch\nthe whole thing quake from side to side like an\nentire table full of jello. This is going to draw\nso many eyes.\n\nYou almost moan with pleasure at the thought.\n\nNo one has ever had an ass like you before.\nEach cheek is bigger than your head. \n\nYou can feel each massive jiggly cheek\nsmashing into each other as you walk. And\nyou sit almost a foot higher due to all the meat\nunderneath you.\n\nYou'd think they'd serve as a counterweight to\nyour massive breats, but you have so much\nboobflesh jiggling in front of you that you're \nstill pulled forwards.\n\nAll they do is make you feel another enormous\njiggly distraction whenever you move.\n\nAt least they're serving as a bit of a counter-\nweight to your massive breasts.\n\nYour butt has somehow continued to grow. It\nsticks out more than a foot behind you, a \nmassive jiggly shelf.\n\nYou stare at the massive spheres that are now\nyour butt.  They dominate the view of you from\nthe back.\n\nEven your enormous hair can't hide it.  Your \ncollosal ass sticks straight through it, so\nmassive that even your huge hair clearly shows\nits shape beneath.\n\nAt this point you barely have to move to sit on\na chair. Your collosal cheeks are so thick that\nyour head is nearly the same height sitting as\nit is standing.\n\nOf course, that assumes you can find a chair\nyou can wedge your massive hips into.\n\nYou ass serves as a pretty good counterweight\nto your ridiculous breasts, actually. Though it\nmakes getting through doorways even harder.\n\nTogether with your absurdly tiny waist and\nmassive hips, you could be some kind of \nancient fertility goddess. \n\nYou have to admit, it's incredibly hot. You can\nfeel yourself getting wet from the sheer beauty\nyou see in the mirror.\n\nYet somehow, even though you now have \nsubstantially more than a foot of flesh sticking\nout behind you, you're not running into things\nnearly as often as you'd think.\n\nSome sixth sense seems to help you\nmaneuver your enormous booty.",

It's faint, but\nsurprisingly pleasant.\n\nYou're not sure how you feel about this.\n\nYou slip down your clothes and take a look at \nyour groin. You're not sure, but it looks like \nthe lips of your new slit have grown a little \nlarger, a little more fleshy.\n\nAnd maybe a little more sensitive as well.\n\nYou take a look at your bare groin. It \ndefinitely looks like things are a little more\nswollen down there.\n\nTentatively reaching down with a finger, you\nare surprised by how sensitive you've become.\\!\nIt's not overpowering, but just touching \nyourself sends a shiver of pleasure through you.\n\nYou've started to notice a subtle but persistent\nheat in your groin. It feels...\\.\\.\\. empty.\nAlmost hungry.\n\nSomething glistens in the mirror.

It's giving\nyou a sort of awkward mincing walk that \n*also* looks irritatingly feminine, but at least\nyou're minimizing the sensations.\n\nYou're reveling in it. Every step is a little joy,\necho of the bigger feeling you can get even\njust from touching yourself through your\nclothes.\n\nThough you try not to do that too often. It's\njust too hard to stifle your moans.\n\nYou're conflicted. It feels good, but it's also\nawkward to be feeling so much pleasure any\ntime you try to move.\n\nThe pulsing heat in your groin is a constant\ndistraction.

Just seeing them\ndraws your mind back to your achingly \nsensitive lower lips.\n\nYou can feel every fold of your puffy, swollen\nlabia. Every point where they rub against\neach other, sending little sparks of pleasure\nthrough you with every motion, every breath.\n\nSometimes it's hard to pay attention to \nanything except the alternating waves of \npleasure and need that keep washing through\nyou.\n\nYou give an irritated look at the massive wet\nspot that's soaked through your clothing \n*again* and try to think of something boring\nand dry. \n\nYou can't deny it, you're horny.\\.\\.\nYou're perpetually horny.\n\nThe dark spot on the front of your pants, the\nway you leave behind a damp patch of your\nown arousal wherever you sit, they \nbroadcast this to the world.\n\nIt's all the fault of your ever more sensitive\ngroin. \\!\nAnd walking.\n\nEvery time you lift your leg, it squeezes your\namazingly sensitive lower lips together.\\!\nEvery time you move it, your labia rub against\neach other and your protruding clit.\n\nAnd when you put it down!\\.\\.

Who would have thought \nwalking could become such a joy?\n\nYour vulva has gotten so sensitive, so swollen.\nSo much that you can't even bring your legs\ntogether. \n\nJust trying sends a shuddering orgasm through \nyou as you squeeze your labia together.\n\nAt this point, almost *everything* sends a \nshuddering orgasm through you.\n\nWalking.\n\nTouching yourself.\n\nThe feeling of clothes shifting over your\nswollen clit.\n\nThe feeling of air blowing past your exposed\nclit.\n\nYou have to constantly remind yourself that\nyou don't like this, each time you're hit with\nanother tsunami of aching pleasure.\n\nIt's irritating how your clothes are never dry!\\!\nHow you leave drips of your own arousal \nanywhere you stand!\n\nHow you-\\. you-\\.\nyooOOOOoooOO\\{OOOO\\}OO!!!!\n\nHow you keep losing trains of thought!\\!\nAnd yet somehow it's not a problem.\n\nYou quiver.

Your days are awash\nin pleasure, sometimes cresting, sometimes\nebbing, but never fully gone.\\!\nIt highlights everything you do with joy.\n\nThere's nothing like a few\nhundred orgasms to leave you full of \nhappiness and ready to face the world.\n\n// Your vulva is so sensitive, so swollen. You've developed a thigh \ngap, keeping you from closing your legs fully. Even trying sends \nanother shuddering orgasm through you, as you squeeze your \nlower lips more tightly together.\n\n// That's not unusual.  Everything sends a shuddering orgasm through \nyou.  Walking, touching yourself, feeling your slit rub against your \nclothes, removing the clothes and letting the air blow over your \nlips...\n\n// (LowR)You've started figuring out how to ride the constant waves of \norgasms.  Let the pleasure lift you up, let it give you energy without \nwashing your thoughts away.  It energizes you to see what \namazing things the game will do to you next.\nThough you do have to be careful not to slip on the juices that are \nnow perpetually seeping down your legs.\n\n// A persistent warmth has settled itself in your lower lips.  (lowR) Just \nbrushing a finger across your lower lips almost makes you moan \nfrom the sensation. Every step you take, you feel a nagging, \nirritating, pleasurable thrill as your swollen labia shift against each \nother.\n\n// (HighR)You shift around, then shift around again, trying to find a \nposition where your lower lips don't rub against each other with \nevery step. If it was just irritation you could handle it; why did it \nhave to feel so good?\n\n// The pulsing heat in your groin is a constant distraction.  Everything \ndown there is so warm, and sensitive, and wet.  Even just thinking \nabout it is enough to give the now-familiar sensation of wetness \nstarting to soak into your underwear. It's a feeling that almost \nnever seems to go away.\n\n// Your crotch aches with heat and need.  The throbbing emptiness is \nconstantly on your mind, pulsing higher with every step. You don't \nneed to look to see that your lower lips have swollen out just a little \nfurther, desperate to grab and pull in something. Or to see the \noccasional bead of lubricant that escapes your underwear to go \nsliding down your leg.\n\n// You look down at your groin. Even without moving your clothes, \nyou can see a few spots of moisture soaking through, evidence of \nthe alternating waves of pleasure and need that keep washing \nthrough you.  You've never felt this horny or this sensitive before, \nnever anything close.\n\n// (LowR)As your gushing slit shows, just walking has become a \npleasure. Just the sensation of your foot hitting the ground can be \nenough to trigger a rush of pleasure in your swollen lips.  It's no \nwonder you're soaking through your clothes.\n\n// (HighR)You try to walk very, very softly. Just placing a foot down \ntoo hard can send the shock up your leg and into your incredibly \nsensitive women parts, triggering another wave of nearly \noverwhelming pleasure.  Your juices soaking nearly through every \nlayer of your clothing shows how difficult it is.",

I'm\na goddess of growth, of abundance!\\.\\.\nI'll just grow those pesky ropes until you can\nstep right out of them.\n\nShe waves her hands one more time.\\.\\.\nThe ropes on \\N[2] start to glow,\nbrighter and brighter.\n\nThen split, half moving down to wrap her legs.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nWell!\\!\nThat didn't go as planned!\n\nPriestess, make a note.

And so the grasshopper\nalways partied alone.\n\nWinter eventually came, as it always does.\\!\nAnd the grasshopper shivered out in the cold,\nwishing for food, while the ant sat in her \nwarm home, well-fed but lonely.\n\nAnd so the grasshopper prayed to the great\ngoddess Florauna for salvation.\n\nAnd the goddess heard, blessed be her name, \nand granted the grasshopper the gift of \nabsolutely *massive* tits. \\!\nAnd that was the ant's kink!\n\nSo she shared her food and home, and the \ngrasshopper shared her boobs, and they\nlived happily ever after.\n\nThe grasshopper was fed and warm, and the \nant learned to relax a little and have fun.\\!\nAnd got to motorboat a truly *divine* pair\nof boobs, which is a miracle of its own.\n\nAnd so the goddess once more showed her\ngrace and wisdom.\n\nShe clasps her hands and bows in a brief\nprayer.\n\nHead Priestess:\nOf course, parables are fine, but what is truly\nimportant is the lessons one learns from them.\n\nWould you care to share what moral you would\ndraw from this story?\n\nThe priestess claps her hands in delight.\n\nHead Priestess:\nExactly!\n\nFlorauna provides!\\!\nMostly larger breasts, but what more does any\nperson really need?\n\nThe priestess claps her hands in delight.\n\nHead Priestess:\nExactly!\n\nLove thy neighbor!\\!\nLove thy neighbor all night!\n\nLove thy neighbor long, and hard, and wet, \nand until thy neighbor is tired and blissed out\nand maybe chafing a little, and then maybe \na little more!\n\nThe priestess claps her hands in delight.\n\nHead Priestess:\nExactly!\n\nThis would be a much sadder story if the \ngrasshopper had not welcomed the ant's \nunquenchable boobthirst!\n\nIt is a call for all of us to open our chests to\neach other in the same way.\n\nShe squeezes her massive breasts in prayer\nand smiles.\n\nHead Priestess:\nThat too.\n\nThe priestess claps her hands in delight.\n\nHead Priestess:\nYes!\\!\nThat is one of the sacred truths Florauna\nteaches!\n\nMay her blessing extend to you as well!\n\nYou feel a brief warmth in your chest as\nthe divine revelation swells your heart.\\!\nAnd other parts as well.\n\nKaede sniffs back a tear.\n\nKaede:\nTruly, the story ist more beautiful every time\nI hearest it.\\!\nA reminder of all the great goddess stands for!\n\nShe bows her head in her own prayer.\n\nKaede looks down at herself.\n\nKaede:\nAh, I always hast enjoyed having flaxen hair.\\!\nThey do say those with hair of finest gold are\nalways the most jolly at the revelry!\n\nATK +5!\nMAT +5!\n\nYou feel a bit of warmth in your heart as well\nat the sight.\n\nNo wait, that's your chest.\\!\nYour shirt creaks a little as it takes the \nincreased load.\n\nThe goddess gives Kaede a giant hug.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nDearest Kaede! My right hand! Most loyal of\nall my followers!\n\nShe pushes out to arms' length and looks\nthe kitsune up and down.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nNow how is the hero treating you?\\!\nAre you eating enough?\\!\nGetting enough sleep?\n\nShe pauses, looking suddenly dismayed.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nOh dear.\\.\\.\\.\nOh dear oh dear.\n\nShe wraps Kaede into another hug, patting\nher comfortingly on the back.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nI hadn't realized just how hard my absence \nwas on you my dear.\n\nYou've faded to a shadow of your former self!\n\nKaede hugs her back.\n\nKaede:\nIt wast worth it to keep thee safe. I could \ntrust no other with the duty.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nWell I'm just glad you're finally getting a \nchance to rest!\\!\nTo see the glories of this new world!\n\nShe gives Kaede one last pat on the back,\nthen steps back and cracks her knuckles.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nNow, let's see what I can do to help you \nrecover.\n\nShe raises her hands and looks Kaede up and\ndown.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nWell I could...\n\nA green glow starts to gather around her\nhands.\\.\\.\\.\nThen flickers out.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nOr I could...\n\nShe starts to reach forward, then stops.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nNo, that won't work either!\n\nShe stares at Kaede for a few minutes.\\!\nThen finally shakes her head and sighs.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nDearest, darling, dearest.\n\nKaede sighs.\n\nKaede:\nI knowest that look of ill news.\n\nThe goddess gives her an apologetic look.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nYes, I'm afraid you're just too drained right\nnow to bear an upgrade.\n\nShe makes a gentle shooing motion.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nGo out there!\\! \nExplore!\\!\nFight some monsters!\n\nBang everyone you see!\n\nAnd return to me when you're recovered more\nof your strength!\n\nI'd say level 10 or so ought to work.\n\nShe gives Kaede a considering look.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nYes, I can help you along dearest!\n\nNow, it'll just be a little infusion of power this\ntime.\\!\nYou're still getting used to my presence again.\n\nBut just keep up the good work and soon\nwe'll have you back to your previous heights!\n\nShe pauses and thinks.\n\nAnd your previous widths, for that matter.\\!\nMostly the widths, really.\n\nSoon you'll be an inspiration for all my \nfollowers once more!\n\nShe reaches out her hands towards Kaede.\\!\nLines of power weave themselves out of the\nair like vines and into the kitsune.\n\nYou see Kaede's chest swell slightly, releasing\na wave of color. It passes through her down to\nthe tips of her tails, leaving behind changes\nas it goes.\n\nATK +5!\nMAT +5!\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nNow that's a little closer to the Kaede I know!\n\nThe goddess folds her into a massive hug.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nIt's been so odd to see you keeping the same\nform for so long!\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nHmm...\\!\nI'm sorry dearest, but you're simply not a high\nenough level to bear more power!\n\nAnd I still haven't figured out what went \nwrong last time.\\!\nI wouldn't want to reduce you to a twig!\n\nThe goddess flings her arms around her\nfollower.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nKaede!\\!\nIt's so good to see you, dearest!\n\nHer eyes focus on the twitching triangular ears\nin front of her.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nAnd what's this?\n\nShe gives an ear a light scratch.\n\nKaede:\nIt's-\\.\\. Ooooo.\n\nGoddess Florauna:\nOh, I just love your new look!\\!\nStriking!\\.\\. Fashionable!\\.\\.\nAnd oh so scritchable!\n\nShe releases her hug to start vigorously\nscratching the catgirl's head with both hands.\n\nKaede:\nThats....\\.\\.\\.
