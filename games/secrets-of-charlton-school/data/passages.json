Only then do you find yourself able to breath without gasping.\n\nThe image of Stitch’s ice cold stare is burned into your brain and won’t leave. You mull over all he said. The Prom. The pithy curses. His amulet.\n\nYour thoughts keep returning to that amulet. You felt it immediately. Something like you’ve never experienced. Something that overshadowed your own powers. Something that voids any progress you’ve made stopping what’s happening at Charlton.\n\nIf you can’t use magic on them, what can you do? The police certainly aren’t going to believe a Headmaster of a school is using magic to brainwash his students.\n\n \n\n Then there are the threats. Could he really turn you into a stripper? Working in some sleazy bar. What did he call it, Dicks? Somewhere men call you names.\n\n \n\n *And would it be you, or would it be Emily?*\n\n \n\n Both options send a shudder coursing through you. \n\n \n\n You think back to the curses and how meekly Christina agreed to correct them. All that effort, wasted. And to think, he expects you to come to him willingly.\n\n \n\n Then there is his offer. You reflect on how easily you accepted. How you willingly agreed to attend that secret meeting. If there’s one silver lining, it’s that you might be able to learn more about their plans. And stop them. If you still want to.\n\n \n\n Your thoughts turn to Christina. The memories that you gave her would have solidified by now. She no doubt has woken up as a brand new person. A small, meek thing, clumsy and unpopular. Everything that Christina would have hated. And you did that to her.\n\n \n\n Then there is his arrogance that you will come around. He didn’t even react to your challenge. Is he really so confident that you can do so little to stop him?\n\nLost in your thoughts for an hour, you admit the day is wasted. You’re too preoccupied to do anything else today.\n\nActions\n\n<>",

She is quick to put up a defence, as you feel a surge of energy rise up from within her. She grits her teeth, and tries to push back against your relentless assault.\n\n \n\n Smiling with grim determination, you press harder. Drawing upon the additional training that Gladys gave you, the well of magical affinity inside your body only grows stronger.\n\n \n\n “No!” Christina shouts, as she sees what you are doing. She tries to push back, but a moment later you watch as she flies back to the floor.\n\n \n\n You cease your assault, taking a deep breath. Slowly, cautiously even, you walk over to your bested opponent, still feeling a flicker of magical aura within her.\n\n \n\n Against all odds, she is still fighting against the spell.

Approaching.\n\n \n If Christina is surprised by your boldness, she doesn’t show it. As you crash a wave of magic into her form, you feel a surge of energy rise up from her being to counter. She even grins, drawing deep down in her own well.\n\n \n\n You yourself grit your teeth, feeling your wave being turned towards you. Inside your body you draw and draw from your own essence, looking for glimmers of energy that have gone previously untapped. \n\n \n\n It’s just not enough. With a smirk, Christina steps up her ferocity and you lose control, hurtling back, landing on your bum in a heap.\n\n \n\n With the slow sound of clicking heels, Christina walks towards you. “When you look back on this, Emily, at least you can say you tried. Unfortunately, as much as I’d like to look past this altercation, I’m afraid I’m out of time.”\n\n \n\n You look up at her, trying to understand.

I had such high hopes for you. You have so much potential. I was hoping someday I’d be able to call you a peer.” Her tone lowers, just slightly. “Even a friend.”\n\n \n\n “Now though,” she says quietly. “It’s too late. You’ve forced my hand. And I don’t have an ace to play.”\n\n \n\n You give her a look, trying to understand.

An amulet, near-identical to the one you wear. \n\n“You’ll find I’m quite well protected against your charms. And the rest of Charlton’s male faculty have similar trinkets to protect them.”\n\nStitch walks further into the room, giving you a wide berth as he doesn’t take his sharp eyes off of you. “I’m curious, Miss. Phillips. Fiddling with pithy curses seems beneath someone of your power. Is it a coincidence, then, that your sudden appearance occurred just as our plans for this year’s Prom are being finalised? Or is disrupting that also part of your goal?\"\n\n He glances at Christina, sleeping on the floor. “She was a powerful tool,” he tells you. “To best her in the magical arts would have taken great skill.

Satisfied, you take a deep breath and relax.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Stitch comments. “Now. You will attend the Charlton Hotel tomorrow evening and introduce yourself as the new head of the coven.

That reason is me.”\n\n \n\n You look at him, seeing a hint of spite in his otherwise expressionless face. “I can stop you,” you say quietly.\n\n \n\n He looks at you, nodding. “Yes. I believe you think you do. Don’t hold on to that for too long, Miss. Phillips. I want your power. I want it badly. In time, I hope you will choose submission willingly, but should you prove a significant threat I won’t hesitate to destroy you in ways you can't comprehend. ”\n\n \n\n “Now,” Stitch says, looking directly at you. “Go home. Leave the school. Pause and reflect. Come see me when you’re ready to relent. You'll find your tampering with our instituions protections against the tainted world will be reset before you return here.”\n \n \n\n \n\"And, of course, I don't believe it's appropriate for you to remain a cheerleader.

We have school to attend.”\n\n \n\n Her green eyes gleam as she turns and strides through the gates, inviting you to confront the past.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n **Charlton School - Main Corridor**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Corridor.png]\n\n \n\n You find yourself in the long, gray corridor of Charlton Upper School. Faceless students drift past in uniforms, their footsteps echoing on polished floor.\n\n \n\n Ahead, Jennifer stands by her locker. The real Jennifer. Dressed in a daggy school uniform. Younger, more innocent. You notice how pale and tense she is. How her books are held close as if they might shield her from the world.\n\n \n\n At her right shoulder, a darker echo of herself shimmers. The caricature. She watches her real self, then turns back at you with a dramatic raised eyebrow.\n\n \n\n “What are we doing here?” you whisper.\n\n \n\n The caricature’s lips curl into a knowing smile. “We’re here at the beginning,” she breathes. “To understand. Watch.”\n\n \n\n Before you can answer, someone brushes past you and strides up to Jen, racking their knuckles on the locker next to her. Jen jumps at the noise and looks up into a face you’ve seen before. Penny. Dark hair and pale skin. But here, she’s confident and authoritative. \n\n \n\n She leans into Jen, voice soft but with an edge of mockery. “Nice skirt,” Penny purrs, eyes flicking over the pleats. “I bet the boys love how easy it is to reach underneath.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s gaze flickers in your direction briefly, then returns to Penny with her shoulders hunched. Penny grins, continuing as though this were any casual chat. “I saw you top of Biology… but your last exam? Disaster. How’d you manage that? Sell out to Harrow’s new methods? Or did his handsome face inspire more… participation?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s eyes glisten. Her mouth parts as though to answer, but no words come. She looks to you again, this time meeting your eyes. Pleading for some shelter in your presence.\n\n \n\n The caricature is suddenly beside you, whispering into your ear. “Yes, she sees you,” she purrs. “In this context, you are Annie. After all, you were in this very spot. Watching.”\n\n \n\n “So are you going to let her be spoken to like that? You know what Annie did here, don’t you? She heard it all and said nothing.”\n\n \n\n A tremor runs through you: the memory of Annie's silent complicity, and the choice that still stretches out before you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You stand mute, lips pressed tight, as the caricature’s grin widens to a cruel arc.\n\n \n\n “Ah, so this is the truth,” she purrs, voice echoing off the lockers. “You let me be bullied. I was doing fine. Not quite top of the class, but good enough. No magic needed to boost my grades. But Penny, ever the rebel, couldn’t accept that a good girl could excel. And you… you heard every cruel word and stood by silently.”\n\n \n\n You glance back at Jennifer - the real Jen - shuts her locker and walks quickly away, tears streaking her cheeks. Penny tosses you a contemptuous look and rolls her eyes. “Sell-outs,” she spits.\n\n \n\n “Not so innocent, are you?” the caricature whispers in your ear.\n\n \n\n Her laughter rings out, triumphant. “Now the truth is out. And that truth will flow into the real world, reminding Annie of what she did. There’s no magic to dispel here. Just a memory for her to recall.”\n\n \n\n The caricature steps in front of you, catching your eyeline as Penny and the school melt away. “Good for you in telling the truth. But how do you feel?\"\n\n \n\n You ponder the question. Something in you feels different. Meek. Humble. Less assertive.\n\n \n\n A smile forms on the caricature's face as she sees your realisation. \"Yes. This is more than a dream. You are Annie, here. How she feels will flow into you.\"\n\n \n\n \"And,\" she adds, grinning. \"Aside from that fleeting feeling of discomfort, this was a free pass. Next time, lying will mean Annie’s hidden memories will never find their way home.”\n\n \n\n \"You mean... I can restore her memories?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n The caricature nods, just as the corridor darkens around her. “But as with all magic, it can't be destroyed. Just transferred. Her false memories must go somewhere. And if not back to little Annie, then they'll find someone else's head to live in.\"\n\n \n\n The remains of the room begins to evaporate, as if its fragments were like leaves in the wind. You feel something changing in the ether. Something escaping from the dream.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You step forward, voice steady: “That’s enough, Penny. Leave her alone.”\n\n \n\n The corridor shudders. The uniformed figures blur and warp as Penny’s eyes snap to yours, shock painted across her features. Jennifer turns too, momentary surprise softening into relief. \n\n \n\n Giving you a dark glance, Penny’s lips part in a hiss before she spins and stalks away. Jennifer watches her go, then turns back to you, lips moving in a silent “Thank you” before she, too, slips off into the corridor, vanishing into the mist.\n\n \n\n The air trembles as the caricature appears at your shoulder, her tone light and mocking. “This isn’t how it happened,” she says, fingers tapping on your arm. “You let it happen. Stood by while you both tormented me. Was that truth too hard to bear?”\n\n \n\n The caricature steps in front of you. “So, now you've told your first lie, tell me. How do you feel?\"\n\n \n\n You ponder the question. Something in you feels different. Assured. Confident. More assertive.\n \n \n \n A smile forms on the caricature's face as she sees your realisation. \"Yes. This is more than a dream. You are Annie, here. How she feels will flow into you.\"\n\n \n\n \"And,\" she adds, grinning. \"Aside from that fleeting feeling of discomfort, this was a free pass. Next time, lying will mean Annie’s hidden memories will never find their way home.”\n\n \n\n \"You mean... I can restore her memories?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n The caricature nods, just as the school around you dissolves into drifting dust. \"Some friendly advice, between old friends,” she whispers, breath cold against your ear. “If you lie next time, Annie’s stolen memories will never find their way home.\"\n\n \n\n “But,\" she adds, as the corridor darkens. \"As with all magic, it can't be destroyed. Just transferred. Her false memories must go somewhere. Maybe into you.”\n\n \n\n The last remnants of the corridor peel away like battered leaves in a gale. You feel the dream unravel. Something precious loosening in the ether and slipping free into the night.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Charlton School - Football Field**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Football_Field.png]\n\n \n\n You find yourself sitting onto the bleachers and gaze down at the empty football pitch, the afternoon sun warming your shoulders. The metal presses against your bare legs, cold to the touch.\n\n \n\n A battered boombox crackles to life at the edge of the field, pumping a steady beat. You glance over to the turf and see Jennifer begin a routine. She’s clad in old workout gear, hair pulled into a ponytail as she launches into a series of energetic dance drills. Only one other person is present. A taller athletic girl, her own dark hair pulled back tightly. You know in your heart their name. Skye.\n\n \n\n Jennifer moves with fierce concentration. Each leap and pivot executed with practiced precision. She’s alone, and yet she’s giving it her all.\n\n \n\n Beside you, the caricature materializes, her grin sharp. “You came all this way just to watch me?” she taunts. “Why’d you bother?”\n\n \n\n The routine finishes and Jennifer stands, hands thrust into the air. Skye launches herself forward and pulls Jennifer in a congratulatory hug. Jennifer beams, then skips off the grass toward the bleachers. Towards you.\n\n \n\n As she approaches, she smiles. “Hey!” her voice bright. “Didn’t expect to see you here. Guess what, though? I made it! I’m on the squad.”\n\n \n\n The caricature leans in close, whispering in your ear, “So… what did you say? Did you lift me up, or knock her down? Were you a nice person?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n You scoff and say, “Congrats. Now you’re just a glorified Barbie doll.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s bright smile falters. Her shoulders slump. She just stares back at you, all happiness lost. \n\n \n\n Skye’s voice breaks the tension, as it rings out across the field. “Time to hit the showers, Jen!”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks over her shoulder and forces a nod. Then, after glances at you once more, retreats toward the locker-room, head bowed.\n\n \n\n As her gentle footsteps fade, the caricature reappears at your side. “You did that to steal my moment,” she purrs. “Jealousy. Envy, maybe. But you weren’t kind. Not one bit, and you did it on purpose.”\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, laughing. “I might’ve slipped a fib before - you've got another free pass! These are just more buried memories Annie refuses to face. But the warm-up’s done. Now comes the meat of the tale. Truth versus fiction.”\n\n \n\n With a sudden ripple, the bleachers and turf dissolve into drifting fragments, and the football field melts away beneath your feet.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You offer Jennifer a warm smile. “That was incredible, Jen. Well done.”\n\n \n\n Her face brightens as she beams back. “Thanks,” she says softly, eyes meeting yours in a moment of unspoken understanding. A sense of a friendship between you two, even now.\n\n \n\n A call rises from the edge of the field. “Time to hit the showers, Jen!” Skye’s voice carries across the grass. \n\n \n\n Jennifer hesitates, then turns back to you. “Maybe… we could grab a coffee at Fresh Pot one morning this weekend?”\n\n \n\n “That would be nice,” you reply. \n\n \n\n Jen smiles at you, then skips away toward the locker room. Beside you, the caricature reappears, her face painted with a warped grin. “A heart-warming piece of fiction,” she purrs. “But you know that never happened, do you? You were snarky. Dismissive. You torn me down at my most treasured moment, instead of lifting me up.”\n\n \n\n Her hand fluttering to her lips in mock astonishment. “Oh!” she exclaims. “I told a fib before. That, too, was a freebee. But now the warm-up’s over. Time for the meat of the tale: truth versus fiction.”\n\n \n\n At her words, the bleachers and pitch dissolve around you, melting into drifting motes of light as the dreamscape shifts once more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Charlton School - Math's Room**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Maths_Room.png]\n\n \n\n You sit at a narrow desk in the Maths classroom, the top pushed up, your bare knees pressing against someone next to you. Penny.\n\n \n\n She’s leaning in with a small compact, dabbing a powder puff at your cheekbone. “Hold still,” she comments with affection.\n\n \n\n You feel something touch your hand at your side. Her fingertips brush yours, light and electrifying.\n\n \n\n “Almost done,” she murmurs, eyes bright as she smooths a stray speck of dust from your skin. Her hand lingers, brushing yours again, and a warmth spreads through you. A tender, unexpected flutter.\n\n \n\n At your shoulder, the caricature’s voice speaks in your ear. “This is one Annie doesn't remember,\" she says softly. \"At least, not like this.”\n\n \n\n Penny’s fingers wrap around yours. Squeeze. Lightning bolts shoot across your body. \n\n \n\n “Now,” the caricature tells you, “she recalls making out with a boy during this lunchbreak.\" For a moment there is a sadness to the caricature's tone, almost regret.\n\n \n\n But it quickly fades. \"Though really,\" she continues. \"What is the past if not a collection of memories? Surely if she doesn’t remember this, it just didn’t happen. And if she does remember it, whose is the memory of that boy?”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n The caricature's voice echoes in your mind. The voice is still Jennifer's, but something darker underneath. Almost like someone breaking character in a play. “So be it. Annie can have her memory of Penny back. And you can have a little treat.”\n\n \n\n The lights flicker, stuttering like a dying pulse. Penny’s eyes widen in admiration, framed by the rapid darkness. Then a longer blackout swallows the room whole.\n\n \n\n When the light returns, you’re not looking at Penny but at a boy. Chestnut hair brushing his brow, chiselled features softened by a grin that’s all warmth and wonder. His gaze settles on you, and you register out of the corner of your eye that you’re no longer in Charlton. This is a Maths classroom, but the one from your school. 's school. Back in the city.\n\n \n\n Before that thought can catch up, he leans in and kisses you. Your heart flutters fiercely, a thrill curling low in your womb as his hand slides just above your knee, and for a moment you are aware of how close to the hem of your skirt his fingers are.\n \n \n*Womb? Skirt?*\n\n \n\n Surprise melts into desire, and you part your lips, kissing him back, leaning into the moment as his fingers press into your inner thigh. You question whether to shift your legs wider. So ready for more.\n\n \n\n But before you can make a decision, the memory fades, fragments scattering like embers on a breeze. The classroom dissolves, and you know, with a sudden clarity, that this memory is now one of when you were at school.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n The caricature's voice echoes in your mind. The voice is still Jennifer's, but something darker underneath. Almost like someone breaking character in a play. “So be it. Let Annie’s recollection of this moment with Penny be lost to time.”\n\n \n\n The lights flicker, stuttering like a dying pulse. Penny’s eyes widen in admiration, framed by the rapid darkness. Then a longer blackout swallows the room whole.\n\n \n\n When the light returns, you’re not looking at Penny but at a boy. Black hair. A chiselled face. Handsome. And grinning with admiration. \n\n \n\n The blonde lock of Annie drifts into your view and you instinctively tuck it back over your ear. You hear yourself giggle, as the boy smiles.\n\n \n\n And before you can say or think one more thing, the boy leans in and kisses you. Your heart flutters fiercely, a thrill curling low in your womb as his hand slides just above your knee, and for a moment you are aware of how close to the hem of your skirt his fingers are.\n\n \n\n Surprise melts into desire, and you part your lips, kissing him back, leaning into the moment as his fingers press into your inner thigh. You question whether to shift your legs wider. So ready for more.\n\n \n\n But before you can make a decision, the memory fades, fragments scattering like embers on a breeze. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Fresh Pot Cafe**\n\n [image: ./images/Fresh_Pot.png]\n\n \n\n You’re perched in a cozy booth at Fresh Pot, laughter bubbling between sips of steaming coffee. Through the window’s reflection, you catch sight of yourself. Still Annie, but now her uniform is more fitted, the top few buttons casually undone. \n\n \n \n You look across the booth to see Christina. Young. Just a freshman. Then to your left, a dark-haired boy whose handsome features soften with every shared joke. Christina chirps, “I just knew you two would get on.”\n\n \n\n Beside you, the caricature materializes, squatting down next to the booth. “You started spending time with the cheerleaders,” she tells you. “Chrissie introduced you to her friends… including our handsome friend here. Definitely your cup of tea, don’t you think?”\n\n \n\n You meet the boy’s eyes and smile. Then the café bell above the door jingles. You look up and feel something inside you drop.\n\n \n\n Penny stands in the doorway, cheeks flushed, eyes shimmering with hurt. \n\n \n\n The boy follows your gaze and asks quietly, “Who’s that?”\n\n \n\n At your ear, a whisper from the caricature. “Remember what you said?”\n\n \n\n You answer, quiet but firm. “Just a friend.” \n\n \n \n Penny’s gaze holds yours a beat longer, then she turns on her heel and storms out.\n\n \n\n The caricature sighs, amusement and accusation warring in her tone. “And how did that make you feel? The real truth, not Annie’s new doctored version. But remember, Annie. Memories don’t vanish. They have to go somewhere…”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n A slow haze of confusion seeps into your mind. Why are you here, sitting with this boy instead of Penny? And why did you choose Christina’s company?\n\n \n\n A flash of Penny’s hurt expression cuts through the moment. You recall her eyes, brimming with betrayal. \n\n \n\n You turn to the caricature at your shoulder, voice trembling. “I feel… like I’m never going to forget that look Penny gave me.”\n\n \n\n The caricature moves into your view. Her usual grin fading into something almost solemn.\n\n \n\n “Yes,” she whispers, voice grave. “That's how you felt, wasn't it? Whatever the cheerleaders were doing, it hadn't set in just yet.\"\n\n \n\n Behind you, the cafe seems to stutter, as if caught between two frames on a worn videotape. The world freezes and flickers. Only the caricature moves with certainty. She sits in the booth next to Christina, looking at you.\n\n \n\n “I’m just a collection of people’s memories of Jennifer,” she says quietly. “But based on other people's recollections, I feel… well, I know she’s sorry of her part in this.”\n\n \n\n You swallow and ask, barely above a whisper, “What did she do?”\n\n \n\n Before she can answer, the lights gutter and die, plunging the booth into darkness. In the void, her voice echoes, already distant and ominous. No longer entirely Jennifer's. More sinister. Spiteful. Dramatic. “The truth has been revealed! Annie remembers her regret. But now… Annie’s current recollection has to go somewhere.”\n\n \n\n A crackle of raw energy ripples through the blackness, and the lights suddenly drop out.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Student Apartment**\n\n [image: ./images/StudentApartmentGathering.png]\n\n \n\n When the lights snap back on, you’re no longer in Fresh Pot. Someplace different. Someplace you recognise. A dimly lit apartment you know all too well. Your first year at University.\n\n \n\n You’re sprawled on a threadbare sofa, once again you, not Annie, loose T-shirt hanging tightly over the waistline of a pair of short denim shorts, legs draped across a lean young man’s thighs. He wears a tight white T-shirt and faded blue jeans, one hand tracing slow circles up and down your calf.\n\n \n\n The door bangs open, and a voice stumbles out mid-sentence: “I swear, I don’t know where they get the gall to --”\n\n \n\n Your best friend, Jeanette, stands framed in the doorway, eyes wide as she takes in you and the boy. Shock ripples across her face before it hardens. You open your mouth, but she whirls and stalks out, the door clicking shut behind her.\n\n \n\n Jason glances over his shoulder. “Jeanette seems… upset.”\n\n \n\n His words pull the memory into focus. And finally, you remember his name. Jason. Your impulsive liaison halfway through your first year. Before him, you and Jeanette were inseparable; after, your friendship splintered.\n\n \n\n You sit up, brushing a strand of hair behind your ear. “She’s been a bit much recently,” you murmur, and in the quiet that follows, it feels undeniably true.\n\n \n\n \n *Does it? Does any of this seem like that at all?*\n\n \n\n “Sounds like there’s another voice inside that pretty little head of yours,” another voice whispers in your ear. This one the caricature. “Along with a memory not too dissimilar to what has been rattling round in Annie’s head,” she adds. “Or is it your memory now? It’s getting hard to keep track of who remembers what around here.”\n\n \n\n Pretty little head? Who is this shadow?\n\n \n\n You glance in the mirror. At your reflection. That’s you, isn’t it? The girl with her legs across a young man, staring back at you.\n\n \n “Sounds like you have a memory not too dissimilar to what has been rattling round in Annie’s head,” a voice whispers in your ear. The caricature. “Or is it your memory now? It’s getting hard to keep track of who remembers what around here.”\n\n \n \n\n You feel the squeeze of the boy’s hand against the inner of your thigh, bringing you back to the present. He grins at you, then, lifting one of your legs over his shoulder, presses his lips to yours as moves on top of you.\n\n \n\n Sensations spread across your body and the lights glow bright, enveloping the room.\n\n \n\n “Now for the grand finale,” you hear the caricature's voice whisper through the light.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You shrug and force a casual smile. “She just… overreacted,\" you tell the caricature. \"When she saw me with the boy. Thought she owned me because we were friends.”\n\n \n\n Since when did it become you and not Annie?\n\n \n\n Before you can think about it, time starts to move again. The boy puts his arm around your shoulders. “She seemed… upset,” he murmurs.\n\n \n\n You remember this boy’s name. Jason. You hooked up with him halfway through your junior year at Charlton. Before that, you and Penny were inseparable. After, you drifted apart.\n\n \n\n “Seems like this was the truth that happened, after all,” a voice whispers into your ear. The caricature. “Penny and Annie always seemed closer than just friends. But I guess you know what really happened.”\n\n \n\n With that, the café’s warmth shatters. The booth, the glass, the echo of laughter, all dissolving into shards of memory drifting in the air.\n\n \n\n “Now for the grand finale,” you hear the caricatures voice whisper through the wind.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Charlton School - Gymnasium**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Gym.png]\n\n \n\n You sit on a bench in the centre of the gym. Glancing around, things look strange. The markings for the basketball court are etched into the wooden floor, but they form strange shapes. Triangles. Pentagrams? You feel as though you’ve taken acid.\n\n \n\n A face appears in front of you. Skye. “It’s okay, Annie. You’re safe. We found you outside. It looks as though you’ve taken something.”\n\n \n\n “Taken something?” you try to say, your words slurring.\n\n \n\n “It’s like she’s trashed,” you hear a voice say from a blurry figure in the background. You recognise it as Christina.\n\n \n\n Skye shoots her a look, then turns back to you. “It’s okay. You’re with friends.”\n\n \n\n “Penny?” you slur. Your head is fuzzy. You can almost hear chanting in the background.\n\n \n\n *She called it care, she called it friend,\n\n But these feelings must now end.*\n\n \n\n Skye shakes her head. “Penny is gone, Annie. She left Charlton.” Her voice is flat. Cold. The murmuring seems louder, whatever sounds like chanting seems to increase in volume. Your head begins to ache.\n\n \n\n “Careful,” the caricature whispers in your ear. “Try to focus. See who’s here.”\n\n \n\n You strain your neck, demanding your eyes focus. Skye stands in front of you, blocking your view. Just behind her, you see Christina sitting with two other cheerleaders in a semi circle. Eyes closed.\n\n \n\n *Burn the root that should not grow,\n\n What she felt, she’ll never know.*\n\n \n\n Skye sees. Reaches her hand out and places it on your forehead, gently lowering your head to look at the floor. “Just rest, Annie. Wait for whatever you’ve taken to pass through.”\n\n \n\n “She’s lying,” the caricature says. “Don’t listen to her.” But you can barely respond. The sounds all around you sound like chants. Like words. Coming from the cheerleaders.\n\n \n\n *Mirror bright and voices cheer,\n\n Make her path and purpose clear.*\n\n \n\n Though your head is heavy, you manage to look up. Skye is gesturing Christina forward. “Ready. If it goes wrong now, it can’t be redone.”\n\n \n\n Christina nods.\n\n \n\n *False desires now unwind,*\n\n \n\n “Do it,”\n\n \n\n *Let sweet boys possess her mind.*\n\n \n\n And you feel your chin being pulled up… and Christina’s lips press firmly on yours -\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Clancy Household - Annie's room**\n\n [image: ./images/ClancyHouseAnniesRoom.png]\n\n \n\n You jolt upright in your bed, heart hammering. The familiar pastel walls and floral curtains of your old teenage room come into focus. Every frilly cushion and polished vanity surface a monument to the life of a teenage girl.\n\n \n\n “Annie!” a cheery voice calls from the hallway. “Are you ready for school yet? Your father can drop you off on the way to the station.”\n\n \n\n It feels like any ordinary morning for Annie Clancy. Except that, sitting at the foot of the bed, is the caricature.\n\n \n\n *And you’re not Annie Clancy!*\n\n \n\n “It was just a dream, wasn’t it?” the caricature asks. “The chanting, the cheerleaders, the kiss from Christina. Pure fancy, right? Just another of Annie’s wild nightmares. Or is the truth about to break loose?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n The caricature looks at you with a satisfied grin. “Correct. They did something to you.”\n\n \n\n And by they,” she adds, looking away at the floor for a moment. “I mean they. Not us. Not me.”\n\n \n\n You recall the memory. Though hazy, you know one thing for sure. Jennifer wasn’t there.\n\n \n\n “What did they do?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She looks back to you, offering a small smile. “I’m just other people’s memories of Jennifer, remember. And whatever that was, someone keeping the memories of what they did guarded. But look in the mirror. You’ll see what they were trying to break. The real Annie.”\n\n \n\n You swing yourself out of bed and move over to the vanity table. Annie Clancy, aged seventeen. Still beautiful. But more care free. No make-up. Innocent.\n\n \n\n You also notice one thing tucked at the bottom. A photo of two girls sitting outside on a beautiful cloudless day, smiling brightly at the camera. Sitting on a grass verge, legs sprawled across each other, their temples leaning against each other. Both look carefree. Happy. Innocent. Penny and Annie.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You force a shaky laugh and wave a hand. “It was just a dream.”\n\n \n\n The caricature looks at you with sad smile. “I suppose it was,” she murmurs, eyes drifting around the pastel room. They settle on the vanity. “It looks oddly bare for someone like Annie, don’t you think? She ended on up many dates. You could say she went a bit boy-crazy.”\n\n \n\n You look up to the mirror on the vanity table and notice one thing tucked at the bottom. A photo of two girls sitting outside on a beautiful cloudless day, smiling brightly at the camera. Sitting on a grass verge, legs sprawled across each other, their temples leaning against each other. Both look carefree. Happy. Innocent. Penny and Annie.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You stare at the image, a surge of feeling stirring just beneath your awareness. There was… something between Annie and Penny. Fleeting, tender, adolescent. Yet unmistakably there, before it was walled off and hidden.\n\n \n\n A whisper drifts across your shoulder. “You’ve wrestled the truth from fiction.” You turn to see the caricature of Jennifer smiling sweetly. “At a cost to yourself, perhaps. I’m impressed at your sacrifice.”\n\n \n\n She sits down on your bed, staring up at you, playing with the hem of her cheerleader outfit. “Annie will remember how you said things were. Her real memories, not the fake ones implanted. And by Annie, I mean the real one. Or at least, the one that isn’t you.”\n\n \n\n You swallow and ask softly, “They used magic against her, didn’t they?”\n\n \n\n The caricature only gives a rueful shrug. “I don’t know much about that. There’s not that many recollections of Jennifer’s involvement in it for me to form an opinion. And those memories of what she knows... they seem to be behind some sort of mental walls, put up by people in their own minds. Take what you want from that.”\n\n \n\n “Will Annie know what happened to her?” you try.\n\n \n\n “Annie will understand even less. No longer seeing it as a dream, but still. If you're not aware of magic, it seems odd, doesn't it? Just a fleeting flashback of a hazy evening in the gym. Ripe enough for a lifetime of questions.”\n\n \n\n “And will she remember how she felt for Penny?”\n\n \n\n She meets your gaze, her eyes bright. “But why give spoilers. You should go ask her, yourself.”\n \n \n You study the photograph, searching for an echo of emotion, but your mind remains strangely unyielding. You know Annie and Penny were good friends. But you just can’t recall anything more.\n\n \n\n “So it seems,” the caricature sighs from behind you. “They were simply good friends… at least for now. Memories shift like sand these days. Who knows what paths are yet to be walked that could give her a different view?”\n\n \n\n You glance back at her and venture, “What about that gym… was it magic?”\n\n \n\n She shrugs, voice soft. “I don’t know much about that,” she replies, shrugging. “And Annie, well, she will know even less. Only that it was a vivid dream.”\n \n \n \n\n You begin to feel tired. You take a step back from the mirror, turning sluggishly towards the bed. The edges of your eyes begin to blur.\n\n \n\n “And now,” you hear the voice of the caricature say. “Our time has come to an end. Thanks for walking with me down memory lane. Maybe I’ll see you again, sometime. In a mirror, someplace. Maybe at a carnival...”\n\n \n\n The words barely register as you stagger forward. And fall, straight down on to the mattress.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Charlton School Gates**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Gates.png]\n\n \n\n You blink awake beneath the iron arch of Charlton Upper School. Pale silhouettes drift through the gates. Identical gray blazers and pleated skirts, faces blurred by morning mist.\n\n \n\n Your gaze drops to your body: the crisp lines of a student uniform fitted to your curves, a single lock of brunette hair slipping free from its ribbon. In this moment, you are Jennifer. Young, uncertain, poised on the edge of everything that would change.\n\n \n\n A tinkling giggle cuts through the hush. There, just inside the gate, stands Annie. Only not the Annie you know but a larger-than-life caricature of her. Her school skirt is scandalously short, her white blouse buttoned low, the heels of her black Mary Jane’s impossibly tall. She bounces forward on tiptoe, blue eyes sparkling.\n\n \n\n “Oh, hi Jen!” she purrs with saccharine cheer. “Remember how we never got along? You used to pick on me. This’ll be fun! Showing you exactly what you did!”\n\n \n\n You swallow and manage, “Who are you?”\n\n \n\n She tosses her hair and giggles again, voice high and breathy. “I’m the sum of everyone’s memories of Annie, silly. The way they all remember her. Coy, over-the-top, a flirt. But we both know that’s not the whole story, don’t we? Come on, let’s explore.”\n\n \n \n With a flourish, she steps through the gates, beckoning you to follow.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n **Charlton School - School Cafeteria**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Cafeteria.png]\n\n \n\n You step into the bustling cafeteria, gray-uniformed bodies drifting past like restless phantoms. The smell of the food is absent, reminding you this is not reality.\n\n \n\n Your eyes settle on Annie, seated alone at a corner table, quietly nibbling her sandwich, every gesture measured and small. Her uniform is regulation, her make-up subtle. She looks more timid and humble than you would have ever dreamed her being.\n\n \n\n Beside her perches the caricature of Annie - with her too-short skirt and exaggerated grin - leaning forward towards you as if eager to spill a secret.\n\n \n\n “What are we doing here?” you whisper.\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, voice soft as silk. “We’re here at the start,” she whispers. “To understand. Just watch!”\n\n \n\n Before you can reply, someone brushes past you and raps on the table. Annie jumps, looking up. The girl is older, most probably in her senior year. Her dark hair pulled back into a ponytail, her athletic physique complimented by a Charlton cheerleader uniform. Deep down you know who this is. Skye.\n\n \n\n “Nice hair,” she says in a mocking tone. Her gaze drifts over Annie’s neatly braided hair. “Did Penny style that for you?” \n\n \n\n Annie looks up at Skye, then looks beyond her. To you. She locks her blue eyes with you, wide and pleading for help.\n\n \n\n The caricature is suddenly right next to you, whispering in your ear. “She can see you, you know? Not me. But you’re right here! With her.”\n\n \n\n Skye remains focused on Annie. She leans in, hand resting on the edge of the table. “Must’ve been nice, lying in those fields, braiding each other’s hair. Very… intimate.” \n\n \n\n Annie’s lips press together, eyes flicking again towards you.\n\n \n\n Skye’s voice drops to a whisper. “Here’s a thing, though Annie. One of the girls on the squad lives opposite Penny. Saw you slip into Penny’s house one evening. And you didn’t emerge until morning. Her parents were away that weekend, too. Bit old for sleepovers, aren’t you?”\n\n \n\n Annie’s face blanches, tears threatening. She glances your way, seeking refuge. At your shoulder, the caricature hisses, “Are you going to let her take that? Because you know what Jennifer did here. She said nothing.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You remain still, lips sealed. The caricature of Annie grins wide. “That's right!” she exclaims, voice tinged with triumph. “You let it happen. You saw Skye taunt me, and though we were friends, you stayed silent. You didn’t dare cross Skye for fear of a future spot on the squad.”\n\n \n\n She leans closer. “Now the truth is out. And that truth will flow into the real world, reminding Jennifer of what she did. She won't be able to bury this one.”\n\n \n\n The caricature steps in front of you, catching your eye line as Skye and the cafeteria melts away. “Well done for telling the truth. Girls shouldn't lie! But you can tell me, girl to girl. How do you feel?\"\n\n \n\n You ponder the question. Something in you feels different. Meek. Humble. Less assertive.\n\n \n\n A smile forms on the caricature's face as she sees your realisation. \"Yes. This is more than a dream. You are Jennifer, here. How she feels will flow into you.\"\n\n \n\n \"And,\" she adds, grinning. \"Aside from that fleeting feeling of discomfort, this was a free pass. Next time, lying will mean Jennifer's buried memories will never bubble up to the surface. She'll be able to keep them buried, where she wants them.\"\n\n \n\n \"You mean... I can force her to confront her part in this?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n The caricature nods, just as the cafeteria shimmers and dissolves into drifting flecks of light. You sense the dream’s fabric unraveling. And something else shifting in the ether, slipping free into the night.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You rise forward, voice firm. “That’s enough, Skye. Leave her be.”\n\n \n\n The cafeteria warps around you as tables stretch and fluorescent lights bend. Skye’s spins to face you, eyes flashing with surprise. Then she turns and stalks away. Annie watches her go, then leans forward to mouth thank you.\n\n \n\n The air trembles as the caricature appears at your shoulder, her tone light and yet mocking. “Naughty. This isn’t how it happened,” she says, fingers tapping on your arm. “You stood there and said nothing. You let me be picked on to save your own skin. Do you really want to hide from the truth?”\n\n \n\n Staring back at the caricature, you try to make sense of it all. She tilts her head. \"And how did those fibs make you feel?\"\n\n \n\n You ponder the question. Something in you feels different. Assured. Confident. More assertive.\n \n \n\n A smile forms on the caricature's face as she sees your realisation. \"Yes. This is more than a dream. You are Jennifer, here. How she feels will flow into you.\"\n \n \n\n Her nostrils flare, before she breaks into a giggle. A performance returning. “Some friendly advice, between old friends,” she whispers, breath cold against your ear. “If you lie, Jennifer’s buried memories will never find their way out. No talking through your feelings with her for you.”\n\n \n\n \"You mean... I can force her to confront her part in this?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n The caricature nods, just as the cafeteria peels away like battered leaves in a gale. You feel the dream unravel. And something precious loosening in the ether and slipping free into the night.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Charlton School - Football Field**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Football_Field.png]\n\n \n\n You find yourself standing on the school football field, nervous butterflies filling your stomach. You look down to see yourself clad in old workout gear, faded either from use or age. It feels constricting, as if you bought before a growth spurt.\n\n \n\n A battered boombox crackles to life at the edge of the field, pumping a steady beat. Instinct takes over you. You begin a routine, ponytail whipping around as you launch into a series of energetic dance drills. You moves with fierce concentration. Each leap and pivot executed with practiced precision. You feel self-conscious as the only one on the pitch, but you keep focused on the end goal.\n\n \n\n Too quickly the routine finishes, and you find yourself in a standing pose, hands thrust into the air. Only when you gasp for breath do you see Annie, dressed in her uniform still, watching intently from the bleachers.\n\n \n\n “I came to watch you,” the caricature whispers in your ear. “Even after all you did. I still wanted to see you succeed.”\n\n \n\n An enthusiastic clapping breaks you attention, and for the first time you notice Skye launches herself towards you, pulling you into a big hug. “That was perfect, Jennifer!” she beams. “Congratulations. You’re on the team!”\n\n \n\n Lost for words, you break into a smile. As Skye releases her grip, you notice her eyes flick towards the bleaches. “Clancy’s been sitting there throughout. Are you two still friends?\n\n \n\n You glance up, seeing Annie still sitting there. Whispering in your ear is her caricature. “Tell the truth, Jenny! What did you do?”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n You meet Skye’s steady gaze. “Annie and I were close when we were kids,” you admit, voice low. “But I... I outgrew that.”\n\n \n\n Skye’s lips curve into a small smile. She glances toward Annie, still perched on the bleachers. “I thought so,” she says softly. “Her and Penny. They seem to revel in being outsiders. Flunking classes, stirring up trouble. That’s not the crowd that’s going to help you, Jennifer.”\n\n \n\n She snaps her fingers. “Now, leave her be and join us. We’re celebrating your place on the squad.”\n\n \n\n Skye turns and strides away, cleaning up the practice gear. \n\n \n\n Looking back to Annie, you see her still watching you. At your side, the caricature appears, her grin sharp. “Well done,” she purrs. “You told the truth. That you cast aside a friend to win favor with the in-crowd.”\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, giggling again. “This was just one more buried memory that Jennifer refuses to talk about. Now she won't have a choice! But the warm-up’s done. Here comes the meat of the tale. Truth versus fiction.”\n\n \n\n Around you, the field melts into drifting embers of light as the dream world unravels once more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You offer Skye a sunny smile. “Of course we’re still friends.”\n\n \n\n The world wavers, the turf rippling under your feet as Skye narrows her eyes. “Just watch yourself around her and Penny,” she warns. “They seem to revel in being outsiders. Flunking classes, stirring up trouble. That won’t do you any favors on the squad.”\n\n \n\n You shrug, voice light. “They’re not so bad. We go way back.”\n\n \n\n Reality stutters again, the field fracturing into shards of green light. The caricature slips in beside you, tone dripping with mock warmth. “Oh little Miss Fibber!” she purrs. “You know this never happened, don't you?”\n\n \n\n The caricature pouts. \"I guess Jen is never going to have to deal with this one. As if it never happened, really.\"\n\n \n\n Then she giggles, grinning with glee. “Now. Time for the meat of the tale: truth versus fiction.”\n\n \n\n Around you, the field melts into drifting embers of light as the dream world unravels once more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Charlton School - Math's Room**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Maths_Room.png]\n\n \n\n You find yourself standing near the door of a hushed Maths room, looking through the ajar door into a class of pale sunlight filtering through high windows onto rows of wooden desks.\n\n \n\n Two of them have been pushed closer together. And sitting at them are Annie and Penny. Their knees press together. Penny leans in, touching up Annie’s make-up, their fingers curling together at Annie’s side. \n\n \n\n At your shoulder, the caricature’s murmurs, voice soft and bittersweet. “How sweet! Shame the real me can no longer remember it. Or at least, not like this. She actually remembers making out with a guy in this particular lunch break!”\n\n \n\n A whisk of movement draws your attention. You turn to see Skye standing beside you, arms crossed, eyebrow arched. She follows your gaze and looks into the room. Then back to you, an eyebrow raised.\n\n \n\n “See what I mean, Jen? Behind closed doors is one thing, but out in the open. This could ruin her.\"\n\n \n\n Skye looks to you, focusing solely on you. “If you really care about your ‘friend’,” she continues, injecting contempt into the word. “Then help save her. Penny’s a bad influence. She’s corrupting her.”\n\n \n\n You glance back in, at the pair. Penny leans in, smoothing a stray eyelash on Annie’s cheek with gentle care. \n\n \n\n “That sort of thing might be fine for outside Charlton,” she continues. “But you know what it’s like around here. She’ll be ostracised for life. Long after Penny disappears into whatever gutter she’ll end up living in, Annie will be shunned. Help me, Jennifer. And help her, if really care.”\n\n \n\n As Skye looks at you for an answer, the caricature whispers into your ear. “Pretty convincing, don't you think?” She asks, then giggles at the idea. “This was the moment, wasn’t it? You knew Skye’s story was a lie, didn’t you? That she was manipulating you. So what did you say?”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n You meet Skye’s gaze and say softly, “I’ll help. Just so long as Annie doesn’t get hurt.”\n\n \n\n Skye’s expression shifts, approval gleaming in her eyes. “Good. Remember the charms we’ve been using to steer the delinquents back on track. We’ll do the same for Annie.”\n\n \n\n You blink. “You want to use magic on her?”\n\n \n\n She shrugs, casual and unflinching. “Just enough to nudge her toward the right path. To give her a bit of independence from that… influence.” She glances toward the desks where Annie sits, absorbed in Penny’s quiet tenderness.\n\n \n\n You feel the weight of her words and find yourself nodding, however reluctantly.\n\n \n\n At your shoulder, the caricature’s voice slips in, low and mocking with a hint of another voice behind her own. “Good,\" she murmurs. \"At least you admit what you did. But I’m not sure it makes up for what happened next.”\n\n \n\n The school corridor fades, the Maths room fragments, and the dream slips away into something else.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You straighten to meet Skye’s gaze. “I won’t help you do that,” you say, voice firm. “I won’t use magic on Annie. It’s wrong.”\n\n \n\n The world around you buckles. The floor ripples like water; the lockers twist into jagged shards. The caricature's shape materialises in front of you, fracturing into frantic, ink-black lines. Her smile torn and wild.\n\n \n\n Skye’s brow furrows. She shakes her head, disappointment in her tone. “Perhaps I misjudged you, Jen. We’re doing what’s right. Guiding those who veer off track. You didn’t balk when we charmed the math class into focusing, did you?”\n\n \n\n The frenzied caricature spits into your ear: “That’s the truth! You started using your little charms willingly!”\n\n \n\n Skye’s voice softens, a warning edge beneath it. “You’ll need to see that Annie is going to get a reputation in Charlton. You don’t want to know about girls who get tarred with that brush. But we can use our gifts to help her.”\n\n \n\n You lift your chin, resolve hardening. “I’m not using magic on her.”\n\n \n\n Reality convulses again. The caricature's form becomes a wild, scrawled outline. Her laughter is a razor’s edge. “Liar, liar, pants on fire! Let’s see how much more you can deny.”\n\n \n\n The school corridor shatters, the Maths room fragments, and the dream slips away into something else.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Fresh Pot Cafe**\n\n [image: ./images/Fresh_Pot.png]\n\n \n\n You find yourself in a booth in Fresh Pot, the cafe’s warmth and chatter swirling around you. A girlish giggle drifts from the table behind you. Annie’s giggle. \n\n \n\n Glancing over your shoulder, you see Annie sitting there. Opposite her is Christina. Young. Just a freshman. And next to Annie is a handsome dark-haired boy, grinning. Christina’s calculating voice chirps, “I just knew you two would get on!”\n\n \n\n A sharp elbow in your ribs pulls you back to your own booth. Skye occupies the seat next to you, her eyes flicking to the tabletop where a curious spread awaits. A smudged lipstick crayon, a napkin scrawled with curling script, an empty pastry plate, salt and pepper shakers, and one of Skye’s black hair ties.\n\n \n\n Your pulse quickens. You recognize the pattern. A charm circle. Skye glances around, then lays her palm flat over the arrangement. A soft amber glow seeps through her skin, veins lighting up beneath her flesh. She meets your eyes and gestures for you to place your hand here, too.\n\n \n\n At your shoulder, the caricature whispers, her voice now clearly a mixture of Annie's and something else more sinister. “Brazen, isn’t it? Weaving magic in plain view, right behind me. But you’d already had a lot of practice by this point, hadn’t you?”\n\n \n\n You look at Skye’s waiting expression. And the spread across the table. Both calling out to you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n You swallow and press your palm into the makeshift circle. A jolt of warmth ripples up your arm as the lipstick, napkin, and pepper shaker tremble on the tabletop. A soft hiss of amber light seeps from beneath your skin, mingling with the glow around Skye’s hand, and a halo of energy drifts over Annie’s head like a golden mist.\n\n \n\n The cafe bell above the door chimes. You turn to see Penny framed in the doorway, looking at Annie. Her face looks upset. Heart-broken.\n\n \n\n The boy beside Annie glances up, brow furrowed. “Who’s that?”\n\n \n\n There’s a moment of relative silence, with only the hissing coffee machine punctuating the atmosphere. Then you hear Annie’s voice, low and sad. “Just a friend.” \n\n \n\n Her gaze flickers to Penny’s momentarily before Penny whirls away and storms out.\n\n \n\n “That’s right,” the caricature whispers in your ear. “Your little charms drove a wedge between Penny and me. A simple suggestion here, a nudge there. And I was none the wiser. Just thought this is how things had always been.\"\n\n \n\n Before you can give any more thought to it, the boy next to Annie leans in, sliding his arm around Annie’s shoulders. “She seemed… upset,” he murmurs. Annie says nothing.\n\n \n\n The caricature exhales in your ear, voice brimming with dark excitement: “Buckle up. Time for the grand finale!”\n\n \n\n Fresh Pot falls away, leaving you falling into the next dream.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You pull your hand back and tuck it into your lap. Reality quakes again as the amber glow sputters. Skye looks at you. She reaches out to your hand, but you wrench away.\n\n \n\n The cafe bell on the door rings. You turn to see Penny framed in the doorway, looking at Annie. Her face looks upset. Heart-broken.\n\n \n\n The boy beside Annie glances up, brow furrowed. “Who’s that?”\n\n \n\n There’s a moment of relative silence, with only the hissing coffee machine punctuating the atmosphere. Then you hear Annie’s voice, approaching confidence. “That’s Penny.”\n\n \n\n Her gaze flickers to Penny’s momentarily before Penny whirls away and storms out. But suddenly Annie leaps from the booth and rushes after her, sprinting through the doors.\n\n \n\n In an instant, the booth and the café dissolve into shards of memory, spinning like leaves in a storm. The caricature's enraged cackle echoes around you as the world tilts into a boundless black void.\n\n \n\n “You can’t face the truth, Jennifer!” she screams, and the darkness swallows you whole.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Charlton School - Gymnasium**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Gym.png]\n\n \n\n You open your eyes to the cavernous hush of the school gym, the echo of distant footsteps and the sharp scent of sweat hanging in the air. To your right, Christina stands impassive, flanked by two cheerleaders you don’t recognize. Each tracing chalk symbols into the scuffed hardwood floor. Preparing.\n\n \n\n But more pressing is Skye, standing in front of you.\n\n \n\n “This isn’t right,” you find yourself saying.\n\n \n\n Skye eyes you darkly. “And what about it is so different?” she replies. “You’ve been playing with her mind for weeks, Jen. This is just the final nudge. Penny’s gone anyway. Her parents moved last week and took her with them. At least this will save her from heartbreak.”\n\n \n\n “But she won’t remember,” you try. “And this whole boycrazy thing. Isn’t that a bit too much?”\n\n \n\n She laughs softly, sharp as a blade. “Better than being a social pariah. Imagine it, Jen. If people were to find out, she’d be cast out at eighteen. Her father would probably lose his job. And believe me, when you take over this squad, you’ll have to deal with some people that collect cast-outs to do some very unsavoury things.”\n\n \n\n Your jaw tightens. “This isn’t what I signed up for. It’s not helping people with charms. It’s changing someone because they aren’t like us.”\n\n \n\n Skye’s eyes glint. “You say tomato…”\n\n \n\n You stare back, resolute. Next to Skye, the jagged outline of the caricature flickers into view. Her voice, a sibilant whisper, “It’s close now. The question that sealed your fate. Can you remember how you answered it?”\n\n \n\n Before you can respond, Christina strides forward, appearing at the side of Skye. “She’s here. Might need to carry her in here, though. Confusion spell hit her harder than expected.”\n\n \n\n Skye looks at Christina, then nods. “You just get her in here. Make sure it’s strong enough to hold throughout. If it goes wrong during the chant, it can’t be redone.”\n\n \n\n Christina walks off towards the gym exit. Then Skye leans forward, offering a smile at your lack of response. “Come on, Jen. Haven’t I always given you what you wanted? You now… just fit in. Don’t you want Annie to experience that too?”\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n You draw in a steady breath and meet Skye’s glare. “No, Skye. I want no part of this.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes narrow in disbelief. “Are you refusing to participate? Be careful, Jen. If you can’t make the hard choices, you can’t be a leader.”\n\n \n\n You lift an eyebrow, voice calm. “Maybe I’m not cut out to lead this squad. Or maybe I just don’t want to.”\n\n \n\n A ripple of tension sweeps the gym. The other cheerleaders, kneeling in a perfect semicircle around a chalk pentagram, glance between you and Skye.\n\n \n\n Skye’s tone turns ice-cold. “Is this a challenge?”\n\n \n\n “No challenge,” you reply. “I just refuse.”\n\n \n\n Skye flashes you a dark smile. “Refusal is a challenge, Jen. You try to deceive me? You have become a rival.”\n\n \n\n Magic crackles in the charged air. You feel a sting of power surging from Skye’s outstretched palms and instinctively weave a shield of your own, warmth flaring beneath your skin. The other cheerleaders freeze, but you feel them summoning their own energy. Skye glares at you.\n\n \n\n You see a ball of amber energy in Skye’s hands. You feel your own skin glowing from your defensive charm.\n\n \n\n The gym doors open with a creak and your attention flicks to the door. Christina hoists Annie in, arm around her to keep her upright. Then she sees you and almost drops Annie.\n\n \n\n Her eyes flick to Skye. You glance too at the head cheerleader, feeling your eyes raise. She throws you a dark look, then shakes her head at Christina. \n\n \n\n “Get out,” Skye tells you. “If you get in our way, they’ll be others who come for you.”\n\n \n\n You glance at Annie. In her magic inflicted state, barely registering where she is. Then to the cheerleaders. To Christina. To Skye. Four versus one. Bad odds.\n\n \n\n Quietly, you take a step forward towards the exit. Then another. And another. You pass Christina. Glance at Annie. Your heart sinks. But you keep walking.\n\n \n\n The open gym door leads to a black void. As you step through it, darkness takes you.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You bite your lip. “Alright. I’m in.”\n\n \n\n The gym warps around you. Floors ripple, lights fracture into jagged sketches. But it returns momentarily. Skye nods. “Take your position.”\n\n \n\n You move to join the squad, now knelt on their knees in a semi-circle. In front of them is a chalk pentagram. On its centre is a gym bench. You kneel down. Only one spot remains for Christina. Skye steps aside, arms folded, watching.\n\n \n\n The main doors groan open. Christina half-drags Annie inside, arm hooked around her shoulders to keep her upright. Annie’s eyes are glassy, her gait unsteady. Too slow, too deliberate. She looks drunk. Or drugged. Perhaps both. But Christina mentioned a spell. Confusion. You don’t know it, but that sounds about right.\n\n \n\n Christina sets Annie down on the bench in front of you and joins the semi-circle, now complete. Annie’s head rolls, trying to focus.\n\n \n\n “It’s okay, Annie,” Skye says as she leans into Annie, with a tone more maternal than normal. “You’re safe. We found you outside. It looks as though you’ve taken something.”\n\n \n\n “Taken something?” Annie tries to say, her words slurring.\n\n \n\n “It’s like she’s trashed,” Christina mutters from beside you. The rest of the squad titters.\n\n \n\n Skye shoots her a look, then turns back to Annie. “It’s okay. You’re with friends.”\n\n \n\n “Penny?” she slurs. You watch her eyes try to focus, but Christina nudges you. Meets your eyes.\n\n \n\n You hear words forming in your mouth. Your throat tightens as a phrase surges up from some buried memory. Words you didn’t know you knew. You begin to chant, clear and steady.\n\n \n\n *She called it care, she called it friend,\n\n But these feelings must now end.*\n\n \n\n The squad falls in, voices rising in unison. A soft amber glow coils through the chalk lines into the pentagram, pulsing with your breath. Tiny faces form and flicker within the magic, drifting toward Annie.\n\n \n\n Meanwhile, Skye continues to reassure Annie in front of you. “Penny is gone, Annie. She left Charlton.”\n\n \n\n Annie strains her neck, trying to see beyond Skye. To you and the squad. To the chanting. You feel the pentagram drawing upon the energies the chanting is generating within you. \n\n \n\n *Burn the root that should not grow,\n\n What she felt, she’ll never know.*\n\n \n\n Annie’s eyes flick toward the circle, confusion and fear mixed in her gaze. You feel Skye’s hand gently tilt Annie’s head down. Again you chant, louder now, the gym trembling with your combined will.\n\n \n\n *Mirror bright and voices cheer,\n\n Make her path and purpose clear.*\n\n \n\n The pentagram’s glow intensifies. The faces inside coil tighter, baring snapping jaws. Skye beckons. “Ready?”\n\n \n\n *False desires now unwind,*\n\n \n\n You nod and rise to your feet, the monsters of raw magic crawling up your arms, sea serpent scales against your skin. Moving forward, you stand next to Skye. “Do it,” she quietly demands.\n\n \n\n *Let sweet boys possess her mind.*\n\n \n\n Your heart thunders as you lift Annie’s chin. The pentagram burns beneath you. With a final surge of magic, you press your lips to hers. Soft, stunned, innocent.\n\n \n\n The world tilts on its axis.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Chambers' Household - Jennifer's room**\n\n [image: ./images/ChambersHouseJennifersRoom.png]\n\n \n \n You bolt upright, breath catching in your throat. The room around you is achingly familiar: pastel walls adorned with cheer photos, a vanity strewn with brushes and makeup, trophies lining a shelf. You’re in your old bedroom. Every detail a testament to your over-achieving popularity.\n\n \n\n A bright male voice calls from the doorway. “Jennifer! Are you up? Don’t want to be late for school today. Aren’t you starting preparations for the prom?”\n\n \n \n “Coming, Daddy!” you reply, your voice uncharacteristically lilting and high-pitched. Gone is the haze of sleep; in its place, a spark of excitement at the thought of prom planning.\n\n \n\n Seems like a normal day for Jennifer Chambers in Charlton. Except. Sitting at the foot of the bed is the caricature of Annie.\n\n \n\n And you’re not Jennifer Chambers!\n\n \n\n “Truth is stranger than fiction,” the caricature says. “To be honest, that’s not what I expected from you. For some reason, you came through at the end. Or at least, refused to be involved.”\n\n \n\n You wince. “That happened?”\n\n \n\n The caricature takes a breath. “Shocking, no? But yes. You finally took some responsibility. It made no difference, though. The ritual still happened. And we never got that back.”\n\n \n\n She nods the study desk. You glance over. Amongst the books and schedules you notice one thing pinned to the back. A photo of two girls on swings out in a field. Annie and Jennifer. As children. The one from Jennifer’s bedroom. Happy.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Chambers' Household - Jennifer's room**\n\n [image: ./images/ChambersHouseJennifersRoom.png]\n\n \n \n You bolt upright, breath catching in your throat.

Sitting at the foot of the bed is the caricature of Annie.\n\n \n\n And you’re not Jennifer Chambers!\n\n \n\n “A beautiful piece of fiction,” the caricature intones, voice high and bubbly. “To be honest, that’s what I expected you would have done. But for some reason, you chose the other path.”\n\n \n\n You wince. It felt so real. So plausible. “That didn’t happen?”\n\n \n\n She sighs, a gesture both weary and triumphant. “More or less. Though without you. For me, you’re sudden turn-about made little difference. The ritual still happened. And we never got that back.”\n\n \n\n She gestures to the cluttered study desk in the corner. You turn to look: planners, school schedules, a corkboard pinned with reminders. Tucked at its edge is a single photograph. A photo of two girls on swings out in a field. Annie and Jennifer. As children. The one from Jennifer’s bedroom. Happy.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You look at the photo, feeling emotions at the edge of your conscious. Pain. Betrayal. A friendship turned sour.\n\n \n\n “You’ve wrestled the truth from fiction,” you hear the caricature say from behind you. “Jen’s attempts to bury her own guilt will be undone. She'll have trouble thinking of anything else! The real Jennifer, I mean. Or at least, the one that isn’t you.”\n\n \n\n “They used magic against her, didn’t they?” you ask the caricature. “Against you?”\n\n \n\n She shrugs. “Like I'd know. I’m just a collection of memories, remember? And, Annie, the real one, well, she knows even less that me.”\n\n \n\n “Can she remember her feelings for Penny?” you ask.\n\n \n\n The caricature seems to think quickly. “Not without help. But you have a knack for that, don’t you? Finding it in even in the most surprising places. Maybe there’s a way you’ll uncover.”\n \n \n You look at the photo, feeling emotions at the edge of your conscious. But try as you might, you can’t seem to feel them. You know that Jennifer and Annie were good friends. Then they weren’t. But you still can’t piece together what happened between them. Or what really happened to Annie.\n\n \n\n “So that's that!” you hear the caricature say from behind you. “Jennifer and Annie were friends. Then they weren’t. The cheerleaders were involved. Magic might have been too. But it's tough to tell the difference between fact and fiction these days. It makes my brain hurt.”\n\n \n\n “What was that stuff in the gym?” you ask the caricature. “Was it magic?”\n\n \n \n “As if I'd know,” she replies, shrugging. “Jennifer has buried those memories deep. Good luck trying to get her to talk. And, Annie, the real one that is. She knows even less. Maybe the odd dream here and there. That's it.\"\n\n \n \n\n You begin to feel tired. You take a step back from the mirror, turning sluggishly towards the bed. The edges of your eyes begin to blur.\n\n \n\n “And now,” you hear the voice of the caricature say. “Our time has come to an end. Thanks for walking with me down memory lane. Maybe I’ll see you again, sometime. In a mirror, someplace. Maybe at a carnival...”\n\n \n\n The words barely register as you stagger forward. And fall, straight down on to the mattress.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

The smile, you note, directed at you.\n\n \n\n “I can’t believe you like filter coffee,” she says, an undertone of coyly mocking you in her voice. “I figured big city types preferred oat lattes and fancy espressos?”\n\n \n\n “Simple man, simple pleasures,” you reply, giving her a grin. “Besides, I’m more interested in the company than the coffee.”\n\n \n\n She says nothing, but you see a slight blush in her cheeks. Inwardly, you high-five yourself. Three dates in and you’re starting to get a handle on what Jennifer likes. Compliments and honesty being at the top of the list.\n\n \n\n “Do you think you’ll ever go back to the city?” She asks, before taking a sip of her own drink.\n\n \n\n You take a moment to consider your response. Truthfully, Charlton has been hard for you. Your parents unexpectedly left soon after moving here, quickly followed by your brother Brock when he left for college. The town is so different to what you’re used to, without even considering the new responsibility of making sure Emily gets through her final year at school.\n\n \n\n In a challenging year, meeting Jennifer whilst clothes shopping for your new job has been one of the few high points. You don’t want to mess this up.\n\n \n\n “I don’t know if I’ll stay long term,” you say with consideration. “But there’s a few things that might make me stay.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer raises an eyebrow, but her smile grows a little behind her coffee cup. Her eyes meet yours and don’t drift away.\n\n \n\n That is, until a firm hand clasps on your shoulder, jolting you in your seat.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n [image: ./images/CharltonTownHall.png]\n\n \n\n The Town Hall lobby is a study in old-world authority - polished wooden floors, solemn paintings of former town leaders, and an air of quiet control. The clock above the reception desk ticks methodically, marking the passage of time as you wait. And wait.\n\n \n\n The receptionist - a middle-aged woman in a crisp blouse and pearl earrings - has already called forward three other people, all Charlton locals, despite arriving after you.\n\n \n\n You shift in your seat, gripping the folder of required documents. Emily needs to be registered. It’s just paperwork.\n\n \n\n Eventually, the receptionist flicks her gaze toward you, lips pursed in mild disapproval.\n\n \n\n “You’re here for the school registration, correct?”\n\n \n\n You straighten. “Yeah. For my sister, Emily.”\n\n \n\n She barely acknowledges your words before retrieving a towering stack of paperwork and dropping it on the counter.\n\n \n\n “There you are,” she says. “Just fill everything out, and we’ll see if we can process it today.”\n\n \n\n See if they can process it?\n\n \n\n You glance down. There’s so much.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home.png]\n\n \n\n The kitchen is a mess.\n\n \n\n A half-eaten sandwich is discarded on the counter, empty soda cans cluster near the sink, and the table is covered in makeup palettes, brushes, and tubes of lipstick, all spread around like someone had tipped a cosmetics bag upside down and left it there.\n\n \n\n Emily sits at the table, elbows propped up, brow furrowed as she awkwardly drags a mascara wand over her lashes, blinking rapidly as if she’s not sure she’s doing it right.\n\n \n\n She exhales sharply, muttering, “Ugh. This is impossible.”\n\n \n\n You barely notice her, though, because your brother Brock stands just across from you, arms crossed, expectant.\n\n \n\n “Why can’t you stay in? What exactly are you doing tonight that’s so important?”\n\n \n\n You glance at the clock. “I have plans.”\n\n \n\n Brock smirks. “Let me guess. Jennifer?”\n\n \n\n You nod, shifting slightly. “Yeah.”\n\n \n\n Brock’s smirk deepens. “It’s not a real date, you know.”\n\n \n\n You bristle.\n\n \n\n “She’s just being nice,” he continues. “That’s what Charlton girls do. They flirt, they make you feel special, and then they marry someone respectable. Someone from Charlton stock.”\n\n \n\n Emily lets out a half-hearted snort, still struggling with her mascara. “He’s not wrong,” she mutters.\n\n \n\n Your jaw tightens. “Yeah? And what would you know about it?”\n\n \n\n Emily throws you a look before rolling her eyes. “More than you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n [image: ./images/CityOffice.png]\n\n \n\n The office hums with energy, a quiet rhythm of keyboards clacking, phones ringing, and the ever-present murmur of workplace chatter.\n\n \n\n Through the tinted city windows, skyscrapers loom. You recall the sight. This was your first week at work. \n\n \n\n Your heels click softly against the polished floor as you make your way to your assigned desk, adjusting the hem of your fitted blouse as you sit. The fabric is crisp, the skirt neat and professional, just like everything else in this office.\n\n \n\n Your first real job out of university - a software development role.\n\n \n\n The company is large, modern, forward-thinking. Or so you thought.\n\n \n\n Because as soon as you settle in, before your fingers even graze the keyboard, a voice calls from across the room.\n\n \n\n “Phillips! Boardroom. Now.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n [image: ./images/StudentApartmentParty.png]\n\n \n\n The music pulses, a heavy bass that vibrates through the floor, the heat of packed bodies pressing close in the dimly lit apartment.\n\n \n\n You remember this party. Your first year. The smells, the music, the atmosphere. It all feels like it was yesterday.\n\n \n\n You even remember the slight tingle of a boy’s eyes lingering on you, the way it sent a flutter of excitement through your stomach.\n\n \n\n Something about that jars you for a moment, but before the thought can settle, a high-pitched shriek cuts through the music.\n\n \n\n \"!\"\n\n \n\n You barely have time to react before Jeanette - your best friend, your housemate - grabs your arm, yanking you toward the couch.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n [image: ./images/HighSchoolGraduation.png]\n\n \n\n The auditorium buzzes with excitement, the air thick with the murmurs of families, the rustling of graduation gowns, the occasional burst of laughter from students whispering about the ceremony.\n\n \n\n You sit among them, your gown smooth against your legs, the tassel of your cap brushing lightly against your shoulder. Your family sits near the back, watching with warm, expectant smiles.\n\n \n\n Emily, bright-eyed and excited, waves enthusiastically, while Brock nods, his usual smirk replaced with something closer to pride. Your parents sit beside them, their expressions a mixture of pride and relief, your mother blinking away happy tears.\n\n \n\n You feel it deep in your chest. The warmth of the moment, the certainty that you belong here, that you have made them proud.\n\n \n\n Around you, your friends whisper excitedly as names are called.\n\n \n\n “Oh my God, how did he even pass?”\n\n \n\n “I swear if I hear Jacob’s name one more time, I’m gonna scream.”\n\n \n\n You laugh softly, your fingers brushing over the fabric of your gown as you listen to the chatter, caught in the joy of it all.\n\n \n\n Then the headmaster’s voice rings out.\n\n \n\n “ Phillips.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You find your sleep broken by fragments of recollections. Images of Emily, Jennifer, Brock. The amulet shines brightly. The school gates creak. The smiles of Annie and the snarls of your boss.\n\n \n\n But nothing concrete. Nothing that you can recall. All too soon, you stir as you acutely become aware of warm sunlight bleeding into your eyes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "The moment broken, you turn to look up beside the booth you and Jennifer are sitting in and grimace. Dan grins down at the pair of you.\n\n \n\n Something feels off about Dan’s presence. You vaguely remember this date, and you’re certain that Dan didn’t make an appearance. But his repugnant cologne is enough to convince you that he’s here, now and present.\n\n \n\n “Phillips,” he mutters, before his eyes flicker over Jennifer. “Well, well. Look at you two. Cozy little date, huh?”\n\n \n\n You’ve only known Dan for a few days since starting at Thompson’s Repairs, but it’s been enough time to get a handle on him. So you’re not surprised when his slimy smile hangs as he stares at Jennifer.\n\n \n\n “Didn’t think you were Jennifer’s type,” Dan says, amusement clear in his voice. “She always struck me as the kind of girl who’d want a real man in a relationship, not one of those… well, you know.” He gestures vaguely. The intent is clear.\n\n \n\n Jennifer stiffens. “Not all men have to be alpha males, Dan,” she says, her voice level. “Some of us actually like men who can hold a conversation instead of just talking up their egos.”\n\n \n\n “Is that right?” Dan asks Jennifer, his grin unwavering. “Not what you used to say, Jen. Thought you liked men to be protectors. Like Gordon.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s eyes furrow at him, her smile long gone. She briefly looks to you, a hint of embarrassment on her face. Clearly though, she’s looking to you for a steer.\n\n \n\n “What about you, Phillips?” Dan says, his hand still resting on your shoulder. “Do you subscribe to all that modern talk?”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You swivel your torso enough that Dan loses his grip on your shoulder, almost sending him falling to the floor. You can’t help but grin as he loses balance.\n\n \n\n “There’s a time and a place for it,” you tell him. “But men should protect their girl. Sometimes, the old ways are the best.”\n\n \n\n You glance at Jennifer to see her reaction. Her eyes are wide and open with shock. There’s a hint of a grin to her mouth though. You notice she runs the tip of her tongue over her lips.\n\n \n\n Dan chuckles as he regains balance. “No offense meant, Phillips. Didn’t think that sort of thing was still in vogue from you cosmopolitan types. Maybe you and Jen aren’t such a bad match, after all.”\n\n \n\n “What can I say,” you continue, feeling emboldened by Jennifer’s looks. “I guess I’m just a bit old fashioned.”\n\n \n\n Dan chuckles again. “Too right. Maybe we should grab a beer up at the country club sometime. Think you’d fit in nicely up there. The uniforms they make the waitresses wear isn’t a bad draw, too.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes gesture over to Jennifer. Immediately, Dan drops his grin. “Oh. Right. Maybe not for you then.” His half-apology is undermined slightly by the blatant wink.\n\n \n\n “Leave you two lovebirds to your drinks. See you at work, Phillips. And see you around, Jen.”\n\n \n\n Dan promptly walks off, leaving you and Jennifer in silence. You quickly break it with an eye roll and soon conversation returns, conspicuously avoiding the encounter.\n\n \n\n You can’t help but notice Jennifer’s demeanour change a little around you. More smiles and giggles. Maybe there’s a little more Charlton in her than you originally thought. And maybe there’s a little more Charlton than you considered in you.\n\n \n\n Good job I’m not a girl…\n\n \n The dream fades. Peaceful sleep returns. All too soon, you stir as you acutely become aware of warm sunlight bleeding into your eyes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n You turn gently to face Dan, feeling awkward with his hand still resting on your shoulder. “I don’t know, Dan. Different strokes for different folks. Isn’t that what they say?”\n\n \n\n He gives you a look, his grin spreading across his face. “You have a lot of experience stroking, Phillips?”\n\n \n\n You feel your cheeks redden. You dare sneak a glance at Jennifer and see she’s actually wincing from the situation.\n\n \n\n “I just meant that some people would find that dated,” you say, noting the wavering conviction in your voice.\n\n \n\n Dan laughs at a volume that bounces around the cafe. “Well, you won’t find much of that opinion around here. Is that you really think? That you’ll keep a girl interested with just talk and deep conversations?”\n\n \n\n You want to say yes. You want to mean it. But the weight of his presence makes your tongue heavy.\n\n \n\n You gulp, looking between Jennifer and Dan. “I think there’s a place for it.”\n\n \n\n “I’m not hearing a no,” Dan chides. “Go on. If you really believe it, tell I’m wrong. Tell me to get out of here and leave you two alone to continue your courtship.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes stare up at Dan. His hand now gripping your shoulder.\n\n \n\n “Leave us alone, Dan,” you hear Jennifer say.\n\n \n\n A moment passes, then Dan releases his grip. He chuckles. “Relax, Phillips. I’m just messing with you. Banter. Come on, I’ll buy you two your coffee. It’s the gentlemanly thing to do.”\n\n \n\n Dan walks off to the counter and passes Flo a few notes. He motions a salute to you, then walks out.\n\n \n \n Silence hangs between you and Jennifer. Her eyes struggle to meet yours.\n\n \n\n “You didn’t have to do that,” you tell her, flatly.\n\n \n\n She sighs, quietly. “Someone had to.”\n\n \n\n It takes a few minutes for the conversation to return. You find something to make a joke out of and Jennifer’s laugh breaks the tension between you. Soon, things seem to be back on track.\n\n \n\n Your mind doesn’t stop drifting back to Dan and Jennifer’s statement, however. As much as it pains for you to admit it, you’ve always struggled with confrontation. Especially from more assertive guys. You just hope that you’ll find a way to deal with these situations, as you imagine this won’t be the last one in Charlton.\n \n \n The dream fades. Peaceful sleep returns. All too soon, you stir as you acutely become aware of warm sunlight bleeding into your eyes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>",

    "text": "As you flip through the pages, your confidence wanes. The questions are strangely worded, almost deliberately confusing.\n\n \n\n Do you affirm your household’s commitment to the values of Charlton’s Civic and Domestic Order?\n\n \n\n That’s not what you expected for a school form.\n\n \n\n Which of the following best describes your home: a) Traditional Household, b) Transitional Household, c) Unstructured Environment?\n\n \n\n What does that mean?\n\n \n\n In the event of educational concerns, which household member is designated to liaise with the town’s guidance committee? a) Father, b) Male Guardian, c) Husband, d) Other (explain).\n\n \n\n Why is “Mother” not on this list?\n\n \n\n Your head starts to ache.\n\n \n\n The receptionist, watching you struggle, offers a thin smile.\n\n \n\n “You seem a little lost, dear,” she says, tone perfectly neutral. “Not everyone is suited for this kind of work, but that’s why Charlton has such capable men around to take care of it.”\n\n \n\n You swallow hard, as she waits for your reply.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You grip the pen and force yourself to push through. But the longer you work, the harder it gets.\n\n \n\n The words blur together. The questions feel like riddles, twisting in ways that make no sense.\n\n \n\n You get through barely half of it before the receptionist casually leans over the counter, glancing at your messy handwriting.\n\n \n\n “Oh, sweetheart,” she says, shaking her head. “Some people just aren’t made for forms, are they?”\n\n \n\n You let out a nervous little laugh, feeling your face heat up.\n\n \n\n “Oh, don’t worry,” she continues, her voice warm, almost maternal. “You don’t have to be good at this. Some people contribute in other ways. A little charm, a bright smile - that can be just as valuable.”\n\n \n\n You giggle. A high, breathy sound that isn’t yours.\n\n \n\n The moment it escapes, you freeze. *Did you just titter. Like a girl?*\n\n \n\n Before you can recover, she plucks the half-finished forms from your hands.\n\n \n\n “I’ll see what we can do,” she says, already tucking them away.\n\n \n\n The tension in your shoulders melts. The feeling of failure - of being completely out of your depth - recedes, replaced by something else. A kind of bubbly relief.\n\n \n\n You don’t have to be good at this. Charlton already has people for this kind of thing.\n\n \n\n Something doesn’t feel right. A nagging feeling, as if this happened to you before. But played out differently. Without you needing help.\n\n \n\n You hear yourself titter again, then dismiss the concern. You shouldn’t think about things that make your brain hurt.\n\n \n The dream fades. Peaceful sleep returns. All too soon, you stir as you acutely become aware of warm sunlight bleeding into your eyes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n\n You hesitate, fingers tightening around the pen. The receptionist is still watching you.\n\n \n\n “I think I need help with this,” you admit.\n\n \n\n She doesn’t look surprised.\n\n \n\n “I’ll call Mr. Whitaker.”\n\n \n\n She picks up the phone and murmurs something. Within minutes, a tall man in a perfectly pressed navy suit steps into the room. Everything about him is impeccable. His hair, his tie, the calm authority in his posture.\n\n \n\n “You must be ,” he says, sitting beside you without being invited. “Let’s not waste time. We’ll get this sorted.”\n\n \n\n He takes the pen from your hand and begins to mark corrections to the words you’ve used. Then he pauses, seeing the blank boxes you’ve not managed to fill in.\n\n \n\n “Household classification?” He pauses, then fills in ‘Traditional Household’ without asking.\n\n \n\n ...That’s not what you were going to put.\n\n \n\n “Household values?” He checks ‘Committed to Charlton’s Domestic and Civic Expectations.’\n\n \n\n ...You weren’t sure if that applied to you.\n\n \n\n “Parental designation?” He circles ‘Male Guardian’ without hesitation.\n\n \n\n You almost object, but his hand moves faster than your words.\n\n \n\n “There,” he says smoothly. “That’s what they’re looking for.”\n\n \n\n You stare at the completed forms. It’s not what you would have written. But it’s done. And it’s correct, isn’t it?\n\n \n\n Looking at the completed forms, something bubbles in your mind. You have a thought that you’ve experienced this form before somewhere. But then, the answers you gave were different. And you gave them without assistance.\n\n \n\n Mr. Whitaker pats your shoulder, bringing you from your thoughts. “See? Much easier when you let the right people take care of things.”\n\n \n\n The receptionist stamps the paperwork with an air of finality.\n\n \n\n “That’ll do,” she says. And that’s that.\n\n \n\n You should feel uneasy. But instead, you feel... relieved. A strange sense of trust settles into your bones. They knew what to put. They know what’s best.\n\n \n The dream fades. Peaceful sleep returns.

    "text": "Brock exhales sharply, taking your attention back. “Look,” he says, tone shifting. “I just mean you need to start thinking long-term. University starts next week. You’re staying here. I’m leaving.”\n\n \n\n He glances at Emily and then gestures at her. “She’s not exactly fitting in,” he says. “Charlton expects girls to be girls. Into fashion and makeup. Not reading books all the time. ”\n\n \n\n Emily freezes for a second, her hand tightening around the mascara wand. \n\n \n\n “She needs some help.”\n\n \n\n You pause, glancing at Emily. She doesn’t say anything, but you can see it - the small, defensive shift in her shoulders, the way she won’t meet your eyes.\n\n \n\n Brock claps you on the shoulder, gives you a knowing look.\n\n \n\n “Plus, the house is a mess.” His tone is light, but the weight in it is impossible to ignore. “You need to start looking after things around here.”\n\n \n\n Then, just before he turns to leave, he tosses out one last line over his shoulder:\n\n \n\n “Just try to take some accountability. Clean up or help Emily. I don’t care. But do something.”\n\n \n\n And then he’s gone, grabbing his jacket and heading out for one last drinking night before university.\n\n \n\n You watch him go. The door shuts with a finality that lingers.\n\n \n\n You turn back to the kitchen, to Emily, to the mess. And you realize you’re not seeing Jennifer tonight. The question is, what are you going to do?\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You exhale slowly, looking around the cluttered kitchen.\n\n \n\n Emily barely glances at you, still poking at her mascara like it personally offended her.\n\n \n\n Letting her attempt her make-up routine, you grab a dish towel and get to work. The first few minutes feel forced, like you’re only doing this because Brock got in your head.\n\n \n\n But as you wipe down the counters, as you stack the plates, as you sweep the floor, something shifts. You start noticing little things that need fixing.\n\n \n\n A smudge on the fridge handle? You clean it.\n\n \n\n A cushion on the couch slightly askew? You straighten it.\n\n \n\n The garbage can two-thirds full? Better take it out now.\n\n \n\n Emily doesn’t comment. She barely notices.\n\n \n\n But you do.\n\n \n\n And before you realize it, the whole night is gone.\n\n \n\n When you finally sit down, the house is neat. The air smells cleaner. You feel... satisfied. Like you did what needed to be done.\n\n \n\n You briefly wonder what your night would have been like if you’d gone to see Jennifer. Where you’d be right now. Would you be in her bed, feeling her warm body against yours. \n\n \n\n The memory seems vibrant. Alive. Almost like it happened.\n\n \n\n But that’s just idle fantasy. This is reality. And in spite of Brock haranguing you into it, you’re happy with what you’ve achieved around the house. It looks great. And you’re proud.\n\n \n The dream fades. Peaceful sleep returns. All too soon, you stir as you acutely become aware of warm sunlight bleeding into your eyes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n\n You hesitate, then pull out the chair across from Emily.\n\n \n\n She looks up, surprised. “You’re not going?”\n\n \n\n You shrug. “You said this stuff was hard, right?”\n\n \n\n She huffs. “Yeah. Turns out looking good takes actual skill. Who knew?”\n\n \n\n You smirk. “So, what, you need help?”\n\n \n\n Emily grins. “Actually... maybe you do.”\n\n \n\n You pause. “What?”\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, studying your face.\n\n \n\n “You’re struggling too, right?” she says. “Like... you don’t really know how to do any of this either.”\n\n \n\n You frown, giving her a skeptical look. This doesn’t feel right. You’re Emily’s older brother, after all. Why would you need to know how to apply make-up?\n\n \n\n But Emily’s already grabbing a brush.\n\n \n\n “Come on,” she says, mischief in her eyes. “Let’s figure it out together.”\n\n \n\n You hesitate. But seeing the enthusiasm in her eyes, you relent.\n\n \n\n At first, you treat it like a joke. Emily wipes a brush across your face. You feel the product touching your skin.\n\n \n\n “Hold still,” she tells you.\n\n \n\n Quickly, Emily starts experimenting. A little foundation. Some contouring. A subtle change at first, just enough to enhance. She’s getting better as she goes, correcting mistakes, smoothing things out.\n\n \n\n When she finally lets you see the mirror, you barely recognize yourself.\n\n \n\n You look... better.\n\n \n\n Emily tilts her head.\n\n \n\n “Much better than the plain Jane look.”\n\n \n\n She smirks, considering.\n\n \n\n “Brock will wish he never said anything,” she says, half-joking. “And with all the attention you’ll get around town? Maybe he’ll even regret leaving us alone here.”\n\n \n\n You swallow.\n\n \n\n The words settle deep. You are sure something is wrong with this. But you can’t quite understand why.\n\n \n\n Instead, you can’t help but think... she’s right.\n\n \n\n “Come on,” she says, standing up. “Maybe there’s something in my wardrobe that will compliment it. I’m sure I’ve got a skirt perfect for you.”\n\n \n\n Emily bounds up the stairs. With only a moment’s hesitation, you follow her.\n\n \n The dream fades. Peaceful sleep returns.

    "text": "You turn your head, blinking in surprise. A senior manager, a man in his mid-40s with a tailored suit and an air of calculated importance, is standing by the glass-walled meeting room.\n\n \n\n You hesitate, then push back from your desk and walk over.\n\n \n\n “Sir?”\n\n \n\n He barely looks at you. “The board’s about to meet, and we need coffee for the clients. Make it quick.”\n\n \n\n You stare at him.\n\n \n\n “Coffee?”\n\n \n\n He finally looks at you - more impatient than annoyed, like you’re a slow student failing a simple test.\n\n \n\n “There’s a Priority One issue in the system,” you explain, straightening your back. “I was just about to -”\n\n \n\n He waves a hand, dismissing your words like they don’t matter.\n\n \n\n “Yes, yes, the system’s down. And you’re part of the team, so you’ll have plenty of time to do your part later.” His expression sharpens. “But clients keep this company running, and right now, their meeting is more important than whatever you're doing at that desk.”\n\n \n\n You open your mouth to argue, but he tilts his head, as if reconsidering something.\n\n \n\n “Unless, of course, you’d rather take this attitude to HR?”\n\n \n\n The implied threat hangs heavy in the air.\n\n \n\n You feel it deep in your gut - that quiet certainty that the wrong response here could set the tone for your entire career.\n\n \n\n And you are not in a position of power. Not yet.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n Your jaw tightens, but you nod.\n\n \n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n \n\n The manager smiles - just a small, satisfied smirk - before turning back to the meeting room.\n\n \n\n Your flats - you wore flats today, didn’t you? - barely make a sound against the floor as you hurry to the break room, grabbing the tray and carefully balancing the steaming cups.\n\n \n\n By the time you return, the meeting has already begun.\n\n \n\n You knock, step inside, and quietly place the drinks in front of the senior executives. None of them acknowledge you. Not a nod, not a thank you. You are invisible.\n\n \n\n Leaving the room, you rush to your desk and log in to resolve the issue. By the time your system comes online, the Priority One issue has exploded. Your manager is furious, the team is frustrated, and you’ve earned a reputation for not pulling your weight - despite being the only one here forced to make coffee runs.\n\n \n\n You doubt whether making coffee runs is really the job of a programmer. In fact, you feel that you didn’t used to do this. Despite this being your first week.\n\n \n\n But you don’t argue. You just get on with it.\n\n \n\n Because that’s what a good employee does.\n\n \n The dream fades. Peaceful sleep returns.

And I know I wouldn’t want to let our clients down. Making our clients happy is our number one job, isn’t it? Whatever it takes.”\n\n \n\n You tilt your head slightly, letting your eyes linger on his just a second longer than necessary.\n\n \n\n The words are reasonable, practical, but the soft curve of your lips suggests something more - an understanding between professionals, a shared confidence that you both know how this works.\n\n \n\n His irritation wavers. You see it - the moment he processes not just your words, but the way you say them.\n\n \n\n He throws you a smirk. “I suppose that’s a fair point.”\n\n \n\n You exhale, feeling a flicker of relief.\n\n \n\n But before you can return to your desk, he smirks slightly, tapping a finger against his chin.\n\n \n\n \"Tell you what,\" he says smoothly. \"Since you’re so keen on considering other people’s needs, we should go over some things later. Just the two of us.\"\n\n \n \n Your stomach drops slightly. His tone is casual - like the request is nothing, like it’s perfectly normal.\n\n \n\n You glance down at your skirt, smoothing the fabric automatically. Then back at him, plastering on the same polite smile as before.\n\n \n\n “Of course, sir.”\n\n \n\n By the time you sit down and open your inbox, the new meeting request is already there.\n\n \n\n **Time**: 7:30 PM.\n\n **Location**: His office.\n\n **Duration**: One hour.\n\n \n\n Your hands hover over the keyboard, motionless.\n\n \n\n It was supposed to just be about not getting coffee.

It’s beyond reproach, a mindset from another time and place.\n\n \n\n Still. You can’t help but smile. Only hesitating briefly, you click ‘accept’. Maybe - just maybe - you’re good at playing it.\n\n \n The dream fades. Peaceful sleep returns.

She’s wearing a fitted crop top with high-waisted jeans, a beer bottle in one hand, the other clutching you like you might vanish if she lets go.\n\n \n\n “Where have you been?” she demands, her smoky eyes narrowing playfully. “Don’t tell me you were, like, actually studying or something.”\n\n \n\n “She was probably being responsible,” another voice teases - a girl named Lila, curled up in the corner of the couch, nursing a drink.\n\n \n\n Jeanette snorts. “Well, she’s making up for it tonight.”\n\n \n\n A red cup appears in your hand, and before you can object, Jeanette nudges it toward your lips.\n\n \n\n “Come on, babe. No excuses.”\n\n \n\n The others grin, their laughter warm, expectant.\n\n \n\n “You don’t want to be the only one sober, right?”\n\n \n\n Her voice is sweet, persuasive, and there’s something so easy about giving in. A bottle of something strong is passed around, the rim glistening in the party lights.\n\n \n\n Jeanette hooks an arm around your shoulders, her grin mischievous. “I was starting to think you’d gone boring on me.”\n\n \n\n The warmth of her presence, the energy of the group, it all pulls you in -\n\n \n\n Then a shadow falls over you.\n\n \n \n Jeanette looks up, her expression shifting, amusement giving way to something else.\n\n \n\n You sense the presence behind you before you even turn around.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n A low chuckle, close enough that you feel the heat of someone standing behind you. You glance over your shoulder -\n\n \n\n And he’s there. Tall. Confident. The kind of effortless charm that makes a man magnetic without even trying.\n\n \n\n A button-down, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, collar open just enough to look relaxed but deliberate. He’s got a beer in one hand, a half-smirk playing at his lips.\n\n \n\n And his eyes are on you. “, right?”\n\n \n\n His voice is smooth, like he already knows the answer. You nod - you think? - before he continues, his eyes never leaving yours.\n\n \n\n “Figured I should come over before Jeanette stole you for the whole night.”\n\n \n\n Jeanette makes a mock gagging sound beside you. “Oh my God, do they hand you guys a script?” she mutters under her breath, then leans in close to you, dropping her voice.\n\n \n\n “Kitchen,” she says, flicking her head toward the other side of the room. “Shots. Then dancing. Fun.”\n\n \n\n Then, she leans back, winking at the guy. “I’m assuming she gets a choice?”\n\n \n\n The boy chuckles, casual, unfazed. “Of course.”\n\n \n\n But his eyes are still locked on you. His attention is a warm pulse against your skin.\n\n \n\n You feel your stomach flutter, the way his gaze lingers making something inside you thrill at being wanted.\n\n \n\n Jeanette gives you a knowing smirk, already pulling away toward the kitchen. You know she’s waiting. But your focus keeps drifting back to him. The way he smiles just for you. The way his fingers barely brush against your wrist as he leans in, voice lower now, just for you to hear -\n\n \n\n “You don’t have to decide right away,” he murmurs. “I’ll be right here.”\n\n \n\n And for a second, you feel it again. That tingle in your stomach, the warmth of being seen.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n Jeanette’s voice is somewhere behind you, a teasing \"Seriously?\", but it’s background noise now.\n\n \n\n Because his hand is already at the small of your back, guiding you through the crowd.\n\n \n\n You hear his friends laugh, someone clapping him on the shoulder as you slip past, but he doesn’t stop or turn back.\n\n \n\n Because his attention is on you. And you love it.\n\n \n\n Every word he murmurs, every small smirk, every tease that sends your stomach into freefall.\n\n \n\n You don’t notice when Jeanette disappears from your mind. You don’t notice when you stop caring about the party. You just follow where he leads.\n\n \n\n Through the hallway, past the laughter, the music, the other couples pressed against the walls.\n\n \n\n And then... the door closes.\n\n \n\n The music dims, the space smaller, more intimate. A dorm room.\n\n \n\n His room.\n\n \n\n You swallow, breath caught somewhere between anticipation and certainty. Because you know what’s coming.\n\n \n\n Because this is what you do now.\n\n \n\n And yet... a flicker of something. Something off.\n\n \n\n You remember this party. You remember this night. But in the memory, it wasn’t a boy. It was a girl.\n\n \n\n A girl whose lips had pressed against yours in a dizzying rush, a girl whose hands had wandered in a way that felt reckless and thrilling.\n\n \n\n You remember her. So why does this feel the same? And why does it feel like it’s always been this way?\n\n \n The dream fades. Peaceful sleep returns. All too soon, you stir as you acutely become aware of warm sunlight bleeding into your eyes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n You exhale sharply, breaking from his gaze.\n\n \n\n “Maybe next time,” you murmur, already moving away.\n\n \n\n Jeanette is grinning as she hooks an arm around your waist. “There’s my girl.”\n\n \n\n She tugs you into the kitchen, two shot glasses already waiting. Lila whoops as you arrive, slamming the counter. “Finally! Took you long enough.”\n\n \n\n Jeanette hands you a shot. “To tonight,” she toasts, eyes bright.\n\n \n\n You hesitate, then clink your glass against hers and throw it back. The alcohol burns, hot and heady, but Jeanette is already grinning wider, already filling another round.\n\n \n\n “Again,” she says. “I’m not letting you be boring tonight.”\n\n \n\n And you don’t protest. The second shot goes down easier than the first. \n\n \n\n Then Jeanette grabs your wrist, pulling you back into the apartment, back into the swirling mass of bodies moving in time with the music.\n\n \n\n You don’t think. You just dance. Jeanette presses close, laughing, spinning you, her hands on your waist, her breath warm against your neck as she shouts something you can’t hear over the bass thumping through your chest.\n\n \n\n You move with her, letting the music take you, arms above your head, the room spinning in a haze of warmth and flashing lights and easy laughter.\n\n \n\n And you feel it.

From next to you, you hear the headmaster add quietly. \"But remember our little deal. Did you honor our agreement?\"\n\n \n\n And then --\n\n \n\n His hand rests on your bum.\n\n \n\n A light touch, deliberate but unseen, out of view from the cameras and the beaming crowd, from your smiling family in the audience.\n\n \n\n For a moment, just a flicker of a second, something feels off. Because you remember your graduation.Don’t you?\n\n \n\n Yes, your family was there. The applause, the warm light, the sense of accomplishment - that was all real.\n\n \n\n But, this? This moment? It happened like this?\n\n \n\n Had he done that?\n\n \n\n The thought lingers, unformed, unspoken.

You earned this achievement, fair and square.\n\n \n\n The feeling of a hand on your rear fades. You glance down, noticing the headmaster is standing at least a foot away from you. His hands tucked behind his back. Smiling back at you with genuine pride. From a headmaster to a hard-working student.\n\n \n\n The camera flashes, the crowd claps, and when you look back to the audience, your family is still beaming at you.\n\n \n\n Pride radiates from their faces, from their belief in you, from the certainty that you are brilliant, exceptional, worthy of success.\n\n \n\n You recall the late nights, the endless studying, the way teachers would push you harder than anyone else. Because they expected excellence.\n\n \n\n You were always working, always meeting expectations, always taking on more and more. You never said no when a teacher told you to do extra coursework, when you were given another assignment, when you were asked to go beyond what was required.\n\n \n\n Because you had to be the best. And now, you are.\n\n \n\n His words about an agreement fade from your mind. You didn’t need anyone’s help. You earned this.\n\n \n\n Your fingers tighten around your diploma, a soft breath of relief escaping your lips.\n\n \n\n You are a model student.\n\n \n\n And that other thought - the one about whether graduation had really happened like this - vanishes before you can dwell on it.\n\n \n The dream fades.

You remember now.\n\n \n\n The extra lessons after school, the trips to the headmaster’s office, the hours spent behind closed doors where no one could see or question or stop you.\n\n \n\n Because this is what was necessary to graduate. This was the agreement.\n\n \n\n You feel that agreement now, physically and ever-present. The way the graduation gown brushes against your bare skin, the realization sinking in that beneath it -\n\n \n\n There is nothing.\n\n \n\n You are standing here, in front of your family, your friends, your entire graduating class. And you are stark naked underneath.\n\n \n\n No one can see it.\n\n \n\n But he knows.\n\n \n\n And you know.\n\n \n\n And for the rest of the day, you’ll be aware of it. Every swish of your gown, every step you take on your high heels, every moment spent in polite conversation, pretending that this is normal.\n\n \n\n You will be forever worried that the slightest misstep will reveal that you are wearing a gown to your graduation, with nothing else but heels.\n\n \n\n And then, when the graduation party begins, when your classmates are drinking, dancing, flirting with boys from their year, you will slip away.\n\n \n\n You will find him.\n\n \n\n Because that’s how this works.

It's quite an honor.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice softens slightly, adding with gentle insistence, \"Please remind Emily that Mr. Stitch's time is very valuable, so she should make every effort to attend.\"\n\n \n\n Before you can respond further, she cheerily thanks you again and hangs up.\n\n \n\n You place the receiver back down, uncertainty gnawing at you. A small voice in the back of your mind questions exactly what you've just signed Emily up for. And what it might mean for her.\n\n \n\n *Thoughts turn to Emily and how she will react. You might want to talk to her before she goes to school next and finds out for herself.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n You pause, then reply carefully, \"Thank you, but I think it's better for Emily to keep her lunch break free for now. She needs some downtime.\"\n\n \n\n There's a stunned silence from the other end. When the receptionist speaks again, her voice has lost some of its brightness, replaced by hesitant concern.\n\n \n\n \"Oh... I - I'm surprised. Mr. Stitch doesn't often extend such opportunities,\" she says slowly, her usual bubbly tone faltering. \"He's not exactly someone you'd want to disappoint...\"\n\n \n\n Lowering her voice, almost whispering, she adds quietly, \"Between you and me, Emily might find school a little more... challenging without Mr. Stitch's support.\"\n\n \n\n You insist firmly, your decision clear.\n\n \n\n Still sounding somewhat shocked, the receptionist quickly regains composure. \"Alright, I’ll inform Mr. Stitch. Have a good day!\"\n\n \n\n She hangs up abruptly, leaving you standing in uneasy silence. You glance towards the stairs, suddenly wondering if you've made the right decision.

Stepping through the main doors, you're immediately struck by the unnatural quiet. The corridors, usually buzzing with polite chatter, stand eerily silent and empty - as if the entire school itself is holding its breath, deliberately avoiding involvement in what's about to happen.\n\n \n\n At reception, the secretary offers a muted but professional greeting, her usual bright demeanor notably subdued. \"Good morning, . Phillips. Mr. Stitch is expecting you. Please, follow me.\"\n\n \n\n She leads you down the vacant hallways, the clicking of her heels echoing off the sterile walls, amplifying the oppressive silence. She pauses outside a tall, imposing oak door, looking at you with a hint of apprehension before quickly stepping aside.\n\n \n\n \"He's inside. Go right ahead.\"\n\n \n\n You stand before the closed door, the polished brass handle feeling cold beneath your fingers. Taking a deep breath to steel yourself, you know there's no turning back now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Men today have gone soft, it declares. Too many excuses, too much thinking, not enough doing. That’s why Max Caress made it and why everyone else is still stuck in mediocrity.\n\nMax wasn’t some academic. He didn’t waste his youth buried in books or chasing pointless qualifications. He dropped out of school, picked up a set of weights, and never looked back. While others sat in classrooms debating theories, he was in the gym, pushing himself past his limits, forging himself into something better.\n\nAnd it paid off. Millions in sponsorships, a personal brand built on sweat and discipline. Thinking never made a man rich - action did. Overanalyzing, hesitating, wondering about the ‘right’ path? That’s weakness. That’s what keeps men from reaching their potential. If you aren’t pushing your body to the limit, if you aren’t proving your strength every single day, then you’re failing.\n\nThe message is clear: a real man doesn’t waste time questioning himself. He acts. He builds. He conquers. Anything else is softness, and softness has no place in success.\n\nAs you finish the article, you crack your knuckles. Your muscles feel tight, your posture shifts. The words linger, reshaping something inside you. Intelligence? Overrated. What’s the point of all that thinking if it doesn’t get results? No one respects a man who dithers over decisions, who worries about the ‘right’ answer like some nervous schoolgirl. Strength, determination, action - that’s what matters.\n\nAnd softness? There’s no room for it. No room for self-doubt, no room for weakness, no room for anything that isn’t hard-earned and battle-tested. You don’t just feel different- you are different. Stronger. Better. Any thoughts of feminine urges drift away.\n\n \n By the time you finish the article, you feel the magic from the article seeping through your body.

Success isn’t about balance, it’s about priorities. And too many men let themselves get bogged down with things that don’t matter - household chores, date nights, making sure she feels appreciated.\n\nThat’s not how winners operate.\n\nA man who wants to climb the corporate ladder needs to focus on one thing - his career. That means cutting out the distractions. Taking out the trash, fixing things around the house, running errands. These aren’t your responsibilities. They’re just obstacles between you and success. The men at the top? They don’t waste their time on things that don’t make them money.\n\nAnd what about her? If she doesn’t like it? If she starts nagging about quality time or helping out? Tell her no.\n\nBecause here’s the secret - the moment you stop catering to her, the moment you put yourself first, that’s when she’ll start chasing you. Women don’t want a man who bends over backward to make them happy. They want a man who’s going places. A man who commands respect, who focuses on his own success.\n\nAnd if she doesn’t? If she walks? Then she was never worth your time to begin with. A man on his way to the top will always have options. A man, just like you.\n\nThe words settle in, clear and undeniable. The idea of putting a relationship before your ambitions seems laughable now. Why waste time proving yourself to one woman when success will bring plenty more? The less you give, the more they want. It’s not about keeping her happy - it’s about making sure you get ahead. And once you do?

A man’s love, it suggests, is not something to be taken for granted - it must be nurtured, maintained, earned.\n\nThe strategies it lays out are clear. Never be predictable. Keep him guessing. Show confidence, but not too much - no man wants to feel challenged, only intrigued. Make him feel lucky to have you, but never let him believe he has won you entirely. If he becomes too comfortable, too certain, the article warns, he will stop appreciating you.\n\nThere are suggestions - arriving fashionably late, letting his calls sit unanswered just long enough, praising him but ensuring he always seeks more of your approval. It is about balance, about playing the role of the perfect woman - assertive enough to be captivating, but always aware that her happiness comes second to his.\n\nA woman who follows these steps, it insists, will always have a man’s attention. She will be adored, cherished. She will remain the center of his world. Because, in the end, that is what matters most.\n\nYou lower the magazine slowly, the words still circling in your mind. The logic of it feels… right. Natural. A part of you resists, questions if this is truly how love works, but the idea slips away before you can hold onto it.

One path led to Charlton, to marriage, to a quiet life where her worth would be measured in the meals she prepared and the children she raised. The other led to the city, to flashing lights and whispered promises, to a world where beauty was currency and every room held someone more powerful, more important than the last.\n\nAt first, it was overwhelming. The men who decided her future didn’t ask her opinions, only if she could pout just right. She learned quickly - words were rarely necessary. It was easier, really. Thinking, questioning, hesitating - those things didn’t get a girl anywhere. Far better to smile, to nod, to let others decide. She was admired, envied, desired. It was enough.\n\nShe stopped reading, stopped caring about the things that once mattered. Conversations that weren’t about the latest trends or who was at which party felt tedious. Politics, literature, even the simple pleasure of forming her own opinions faded into irrelevance. What use were thoughts when beauty spoke for itself?\n\nThe man she left behind, the life she abandoned - it barely lingers. Just the occasional echo, a name she doesn’t quite remember, a face blurred at the edges. But why dwell? The city demands attention, and thinking too much only leads to wrinkles. \n\nMen are fleeting, dispensable. At best they come and go, whenever she has time. The lights of the camera are what matters. That’s how she makes her money. That’s how she made her career.\n\nYou blink at the page, your thoughts slower than they should be, your mind hazy with the weight of its words. Hadn’t you always valued intelligence? The ability to think, to question? But the idea drifts away before you can grasp it, slipping through your fingers like perfume in the air.\n\nInstead, you consider the other angle to the article. The idea of romance, of love, feels distant now. Abstract. Especially with men. Love is fickle, and men - well, a man’s attention is a tool, something to be used, not something to be wanted.\n\nThe magazine slips from your fingers.

The details are slightly wrong, the colours a little too muted.\n\nBut before you can digest specifics, you see - no, you sense - something behind you.\n\nYou turn to see a man standing there. Tall, somewhere in his mid-twenties, with short hair and a perpetual layer of stubble. Dark eyes. His very presence seems ethereal, as if made up of gas and vapor. His features and clothes are only just defined enough to recognise him as a person.\n\nAs to who he is… you have no idea. Or do you?\n\n“Hello ,” he says coldly. “Or is it now? We have a lot to discuss. About us.”\n\nYour mouth drops as realisation hits you. This person. This man. This is - or was, at least - you.\n\nActions\n\n<>",

Your little trinket might have overwritten reality with this,” he gestures to your body. “But there’s fragments of other people’s memories and perceptions of you lingering on the edges of their minds. I’m just all of those pieces patched together.”\n\n \n\n Struggling to understand, you frown. “So, you’re other people’s perception of me?”\n\n \n\n “Of what you were,” he replies. “Not what you’ve become. It’s shocking how quickly you’ve accepted all of this, really. I’d call you weak if it wasn’t just insulting me.”\n\n \n\n “I don’t remember being… you. At all.” you tell the spectre. \n\n \n\n “Liar liar,” he says, tauntingly. “There’s bits of me still in you. Buried deep, but it’s there. That voice you keep hearing, questioning your actions. “You don’t really want to be doing this, don’t you? That’s me. Coming up for air.”\n\n \n\n “But for the most part, I’m kept under the surface,” he continues. “That’s the power of that amulet. That witch led us to believe it just transformed your body. When actually it distorts reality. If it wasn’t for that vial, I would have been drowned forever. You sure didn’t try to keep me around.”\n\n \n\n You detect the menace to the shadows voice. It - he? - sounds like he’s barely holding back rage. At what he’s lost. At what you’ve become.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You look the visage up and down, trying to understand what you’re seeing. “What happened to you?” you ask. “To us, I mean.”\n\n \n\n “Two different questions. Maybe still the same answer, though. You were me when you started using the amulet. . A mid-twenty something programmer who just wanted to protect his sister, get out of Charlton with his girlfriend and see the world. Your actions of late, though have sullied those facts.”\n\n \n\n “I had a girlfriend?” you ask, trying to remember. \n\n \n\n The shadow snorts. “Jennifer,” he says, slowly. “Jennifer is your girlfriend. How can you have forgotten that?”\n\n \n\n “Jen?” you say, astonished. “My friend, Jennifer?”\n\n \n\n “Are you serious?” the shadow snaps back. “You’ve become BFFs with the woman you were planning to marry? That’s all kinds of… I don’t even have the words.”\n\n \n\n “I’m not sure how to feel about that,” you mutter. You’ve never thought of Jennifer as anything other than a friend. Except apparently, she was much more. When you were… when you were you?\n\n \n\n “I’m what you were, before you started changing,” he adds. “What you should be. What’s been stolen away from you. From us.”\n\n \n\n Something about his emphasis on the last word sends shivers up your spine. For the first time, you note how much taller he is than you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Where is this place?” you ask. “It looks like home. I mean, the city I grew up in.” Seeing his look, you quickly add: “I mean, ‘we.’ I guess.”\n\n \n\n “You still call the city your home?” the shadow asks. “Maybe there’s hope for you, yet.” \n\n \n\n He looks around, opening his arms out as he turns. “This, is a figment of your imagination. A dream state, induced by magic. It could have been anything your subconscious desired. I guess home really is where the heart is.”\n\n \n\n You look around too. The city looks as it should, late at night. Lights and signs, shops open, pavements glistening with settled rain. “So, it’s just a dream?” \n\n \n\n “Dreams are just in your head,” the shadow states plainly. “This is something different. A place that exists in-between realities. On the magical plane.”\n\n \n\n “But none of this is real?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n “It’s real to me,” your shadow self replies, a slight edge to his tone. “You might say it’s all I’ve got. For now.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n Your shadow self grins, revealing dark teeth. “Then we have only the next step to consider. I’ll be blunt. I don’t like what you’ve done to us. I don’t even know how - I - could have let this happen. But now you know what we actually are, you can correct it.\n\n \n\n “How?” you say, with some dismay. “I can’t remember this life. I can barely remember you.”\n\n \n\n Another devilish grin. “Your dreams changed your memories. So let’s summon some of mine. Run through a memory, pick the correct option, and boom. You’ll wake up with some of your life back.”\n\n \n\n “You’re not me, though,” you reply. “You’re just a magical facsimile.”\n\n \n\n “Cold, ,” your shadow self states, almost snarling. “I’m about the best chance we’ve got of being anything other than a docile little girl. You don’t want to be that, do you?”\n\n \n\n You stare back at yourself with a hard look. “And there’s no consequences?”\n\n \n\n “It’s magic,” the shadow replies. “Of course there’s consequences. The question is, how much do you want your old life back?”\n\n \n\n He stares back at you, grinning. Waiting for your reply.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n Your shadow self grins, sharp and wolfish.\n\n \n\n “You’ve changed,” he says, voice laced with disgust. “But not beyond repair.”\n\n \n\n His eyes gleam, dark and hungry. \"We can fix you.\"\n\n \n\n A wave of mist swirls around you, the shadows shifting, bending, memories beginning to form from the fog.\n\n \n\n “You want a piece of yourself back?” your Shadow Self murmurs. “Then relive one of our greatest hits. Step into a moment of our old life - take the right path - and it’s yours.”\n\n \n\n His smirk widens, flashing dark teeth.\n\n \n\n “The real question is, do you still have it in you?”\n\n \n\n The world shudders, pulling you into a past you should remember.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You square your shoulders, planting your feet firmly on the uneven, dreamlike ground beneath you.\n\n \n\n “No,” you say, voice steady. “I don’t need to change. I’m fine just the way I am.”\n\n \n\n Your Shadow Self’s smirk flickers, just for a moment.\n\n \n\n Then, slowly, it curves back into something darker.\n\n \n\n “Oh, really?” His voice is silkier now, dripping with mock amusement, but there’s something coiled beneath it, something waiting to strike.\n\n \n\n “You’re fine, huh?” He steps forward, the mist around him writhing like a living thing.\n\n \n\n “Fine with the way things are? Fine with what’s happening to you?” His eyes gleam. “Fine with what you’re becoming?”\n\n \n\n You hold your ground, but the weight of his words presses down, heavy and unshakable.\n\n \n\n He clicks his tongue, shaking his head. “Pathetic,” he mutters. “You really think this is over?”\n\n \n\n His form shifts, the edges of him distorting, darkening, his voice curling through the air like a whisper that refuses to fade.\n\n \n\n “Enjoy your little fantasy while it lasts. If you won’t fight for yourself, then I’ll have to take matters into our own hands.”\n\n \n\n Then, the world shatters.\n\n \n\n Darkness swallows everything, the mist closing in, pulling you down --\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n [image: ./images/CityNight.png]\n\n \n\n \n \n The city slowly reforms, mist receding like the tide, revealing the dim glow of streetlights against damp pavement. The air is cool, heavy with the scent of rain that never quite falls.\n\n \n\n Your Shadow Self stands just beyond the flickering neon, his form more solid now, more defined, as if the dreams have strengthened him.\n\n \n\n He studies you, his expression unreadable at first. Then, a smirk.\n\n \n\n \"Maybe there’s hope for you yet.\" His voice is low, amused, dripping with satisfaction.\n\n \n\n He tucks his hands into his pockets, watching you like a hunter sizing up prey.\n\n \n\n \"I’ll be seeing you around.\"\n\n \n\n His smirk widens.\n\n \n\n \"Be sure of it.\"\n\n \n\n Then - he steps back, the mist curling around him, swallowing him whole.\n\n \n The mist swirls, the city street re-emerging from the fading fragments of the dream. The storefronts flicker into focus, neon signs buzzing faintly above darkened windows. But the air is thicker now, charged with something electric.\n\n \n\n Your Shadow Self stands in the middle of the street, his form unstable, edges shifting, flickering between solid and smoke. His expression is twisted with rage, his dark eyes burning as he steps toward you.\n\n \n\n \"You think this is over?\" he snarls, voice low and vibrating with fury. \"You think you can just push me aside and pretend I never existed?\"\n\n \n\n He takes another step, the shadows coiling around his feet like a living thing.\n\n \n\n \"You’re weak.\" The words are sharp, biting. \"And if you won’t fight for yourself, then I’ll have to take matters into our own hands.\"\n\n \n\n The ground shudders beneath you, and for a brief, terrifying second, you feel him pulling at something inside you -\n\n \n\n Trying to force his way in.\n\n \n\n You gasp, stumbling back, heart hammering...\n\n \n\n And then -\n\n \n \n\n Darkness.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Neon signs flicker lazily on the walls, casting a warm amber glow across the bar.\n\n \n\n You blink. Something feels off. You can feel the weight of your shoulders, the broader width of your chest, the familiar but now alien sensation of stubble grazing your jaw as you exhale. You glance in the nearby window and catch your reflection staring back at you. The reflection of .\n\n \n\n *\"What’s wrong?\"* a voice murmurs inside your brain. *\"Feeling out of place?\"*\n\n \n\n You swallow, your throat thicker, voice deeper than you remember. You remember this place. A dive bar, back in the city. That your brother Brock and his friends used to frequent. The ones around this table, right now.\n\n \n\n Opposite, your brother leans back in his chair, tipping his beer bottle toward you. “You gonna order, man, or what?”\n\n \n\n You look up to see a waitress standing patiently beside the table. A table full of Brock and his friends. And now you. As .\n\n \n\n She’s young, pretty in a casual, effortless way, her blonde ponytail swinging as she pulls out her notepad, a pen tucked neatly behind her ear. She’s already smiling, friendly but distant, the kind of practiced politeness that comes from waiting tables in places like this.\n\n \n\n “What can I get for you boys?” she asks. Boys. The word slips over you strangely, both familiar and wrong.\n\n \n\n “Uh, yeah,” you clear your throat. “Can we grab another round of -”\n\n \n\n “She’s asking what *you* want, genius,” Brock cuts in, smirking. “Come on, don’t keep the lady waiting.”\n\n \n\n *Careful. Wouldn’t want her thinking you’re soft, now, would you?*\n\n \n\n You ignore the voice and smile politely at the waitress. “Same as the rest, thanks.”\n\n \n\n She nods. “Coming right up.”\n\n \n\n That’s it? Where’s the fun in that?\n\n \n\n But the conversation moves on before you can dwell.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Brock watches the waitress leave, shaking his head. “Man, she’s cute.”\n\n \n\n “She’s alright,” one of his friends says, leaning forward. “I bet she’d be more than alright if you took her home.”\n\n \n\n The table erupts in laughter, beer bottles clinking together, the easy camaraderie of men being men.\n\n \n\n *\"You remember this, don't you?\"* your Shadow Self murmurs, a dark satisfaction curling into his tone. *\"This is where you belong. Sitting with the guys. Laughing. Being one of them.\"*\n\n \n\n “Come on, bro,” Brock says, bringing you back to focus on the table. “Live a little. Play the game. When she comes back, tease her a bit. She gets paid for it.”\n\n \n\n “I don’t think she’s into geek,” one of Brock’s friends quips. The group collectively laughs. \n\n \n\n The waitress returns a few minutes later, carrying a tray, balancing bottles with expert ease. She sets them down, smooth, practiced, then pulls out her notepad.\n\n \n\n “That’ll be twenty-five fifty,” she says, giving you a small smile.\n\n \n\n You glance around the table. Eyes rest on you. Brock’s eyebrow raises.\n\n \n\n *Come on. You remember what you said to her, don’t you?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You lean back in your chair, flashing a smirk, letting the moment stretch just enough before responding.\n\n \n\n “Come on,” you say, voice smooth, familiar, slipping into the rhythm of banter as easily as pulling on an old, worn jacket. “Don’t I get a winning smile with my drink?”\n\n \n\n The waitress freezes for just a second. A flicker of something unreadable passes over her face - then, she plasters on a polite laugh, moving through the motions, the same way she probably has a hundred times before.\n\n \n\n Brock and the others laugh as you hand over three notes to her. “Keep the change,” you tell her. She flashes you a polite smile, but you notice how forced it seems. Behind it is a quiet resignation of yet another drunk customer. \n\n \n\n The waitress scribbles down the receipt quickly, then nods, moving away without another word.\n\n \n\n *See? That wasn’t so hard. Just a little push, and you’re already slipping back into place.*\n\n \n\n You take a long sip of your beer.\n\n \n\n The night carries on, and you don’t think about the way her eyes looked dead to you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You smile politely, reaching for your wallet.\n\n \n\n “Here,” you say, handing over the cash without hesitation. “Keep the change.”\n\n \n\n What? What was that?\n\n \n\n She looks mildly surprised, eyes flicking up to meet yours before giving a small, genuine nod.\n\n \n\n “Thanks,” she says, then turns to leave.\n\n \n\n Brock raises an eyebrow as you pick up your beer. “Damn, getting soft on me, huh?”\n\n \n\n You shrug, taking a sip. “Just being polite.”\n\n \n\n Brock scoffs but doesn’t push it. The moment passes, the conversation shifting, the beers flowing again.\n\n \n\n That’s it? Just being polite? That’s not how it went, . Or should I just keep calling you ?\n\n \n\n But you ignore him.\n\n \n\n The night moves on, and you don’t feel bad about it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

The air is thick with the scent of cheap beer and microwave pizza, voices overlapping in a haze of conversation and laughter.\n\n \n\n You blink. The beer bottle in your hand feels solid, familiar. Your clothes fit differently, the looser, more relaxed weight of a hoodie against your arms.\n\n \n\n You’re . And this is a memory. It seeps into your brain. A low-key university gathering, not a raging party - your crowd. A handful of guys from your course, a few friends of friends, and Emma, the girl you’ve had your eye on since the start of the semester.\n\n \n\n Feels good, doesn’t it? Being yourself again. No makeup, no skirts, no giggling for attention. Just beer, games, and a pretty girl worth chasing.\n\n \n\n Emma is sitting on the couch, curled up with her legs tucked under her, laughing at something one of the other guys just said. She’s cute, in a way that feels attainable. Not the kind of girl who’d be out of reach, but someone you could have a real shot with. Maybe even a real thing with.\n\n \n\n You’ve also seen the way she glances at you, the small moments where she lingers in conversation.\n\n \n\n You can do this.\n\n \n\n Yeah, you can. But you have to prove it. Don’t just sit there and let the night pass you by. Show her you’re interested. Show everyone.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You move over to the couch, but just as you approach a voice interrupts from behind it.\n\n \n\n “Hey, Emma,” Greg says, leaning nervously over the sofa.\n\n \n\n Memories swell up. Greg is one of your friends. A decent guy. Geeky, quiet, not blessed with confidence. \n\n \n\n “Oh. Hey Greg,” Emma responds, politely smiling back to him. \n\n \n\n Watching him for a moment, you grimace. Something about the way he’s leaning forward just a little too much, the nervous way his fingers twitch against his bottle. He’s trying to put himself out there. Just like you’ve told him to.\n\n \n\n You just didn’t say anything about it being Emma, though.\n\n \n\n *\"He got in your way,”* your Shadow Self whispers to you. *“And you weren’t cruel about it...\"*\n\n \n\n Make yourself the better option. Make her laugh. If Greg crashes and burns, that’s his fault, right?\n\n \n\n You glance at Emma. She’s listening to Greg prattle on about the current state of the opposition government, but her smile is neutral.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You grin, watching Greg stumble through his point - he’s trying to explain a theory he’s developing on a way to engage grassroots activism, but he’s over-explaining it, his enthusiasm drawing it out and making it hard to follow. \n\n \n\n It’s harmless. Yet it’s boring. You bet that Emma is too polite to shut him down. *But you’re not.*\n\n \n\n You lean back, sitting down and stretching your arms lazily over the back of the couch. Then jump in just as he pauses for breath.\n\n \n\n “Greg, my guy,” you say, smirking, “I think Emma came here to have fun, not to sit through a lecture.”\n\n \n\n Greg blinks, startled. “I was just -”\n\n \n\n Emma titters. And that’s all it takes.\n\n \n\n Greg closes his mouth, his confidence draining like a battery on its last charge. His eyes hang on you, hurt and ashamed. Without a word, he slithers away.\n\n \n\n Emma turns her attention fully to you, sipping her drink, smirking slightly. You smirk back. And you know where the night is going to take you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You stay quiet, watching from the edge of the sofa.\n\n \n\n You could make a joke, could shut Greg down, but… Emma is listening to him.\n\n \n\n She’s not leaning in, not flirting, but she’s giving him a chance. And instead of forcing yourself into the moment, you just… let it happen.\n\n \n\n *\"What are you doing?\"* your Shadow Self hisses, voice laced with irritation. *\"You’re just going to sit there? Let Greg take the shot?\"*\n\n \n\n Maybe. Maybe Greg has a shot. Maybe he doesn’t.

She’s eager, pushing past the subtle groans from a few guys who, despite working in tech in the city, still think she’s out of her depth.\n\n \n\n But she doesn’t let it shake her. She grabs the marker and launches into an idea.\n\n \n\n It’s… smart. Really smart. A novel approach, one that pushes the limits of what the system can handle.\n\n \n\n *She’s good. But she’s also wrong.*\n\n \n\n You see the flaw immediately. Her solution is too clever for its own good. It’ll create a severe load on server requests, causing bottlenecks elsewhere.\n\n \n\n She doesn’t see it. Neither does anyone else. They’re nodding, impressed, warming up to the idea now that they can see how it works. The attention for once has shifted from you. And it’s incorrect.\n\n \n\n *\"You gonna let this stand?\"* your Shadow Self whispers, mocking. *\"This is your moment. Step in. Shut it down. Show them who the real expert is.\"*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n You bite your tongue. You could cut in right now, take control of the conversation, fix the problem in front of everyone.\n\n \n\n But you don’t. Something about doing that to Claire doesn’t sit right.\n\n \n\n *You’re letting this happen? Letting her talk nonsense while they all nod along? What happened to you?\"*\n\n \n\n Claire finishes her pitch, stepping back. The team discusses it, bouncing ideas, still impressed. And then the meeting moves on.\n\n \n\n You don’t step in. Instead, you wait.\n\n \n\n Later, as the office empties for lunch, you find Claire at her desk, typing away. You lean on the partition next to her desk. “Hey. Got a second?”\n\n \n\n She looks up, surprised. “Uh, yeah. What’s up?”\n\n \n\n You tap the side of her monitor.\n\n \n\n “Your solution. It’s smart,” you say. “But it’s going to create server overload because of how the requests pile up. You see it?”\n\n \n\n She pauses, processing. Then her eyes widen slightly.\n\n \n\n “Oh, shit. I didn’t think about that.”\n\n \n\n You nod. “It’s an easy fix, though. We just need to adjust the processing sequence, and it’ll work without the overload.”\n\n \n\n She laughs, shaking her head. “I can’t believe I missed that.”\n\n \n\n “You were close,” you say, smiling. “And you got the team thinking differently. That’s worth something.”\n\n \n\n Claire grins, looking genuinely appreciative.\n\n \n\n *Pathetic. You could’ve fixed it in front of everyone, but instead, you handed her the win.*\n\n \n\n Maybe.\n\n \n\n But Claire doesn’t look humiliated. She looks like she learned something. And you don’t feel bad about it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You step forward, lifting a hand. “Wait,” you say, cutting in before she can continue.\n\n \n\n Claire pauses, blinking at you, the marker still hovering near the board.\n\n \n\n “This won’t work,” you say plainly, gesturing toward the core of her diagram. “Your approach is going to overload the system with unnecessary requests. The bottleneck won’t be where you think. It’ll be here.”\n\n \n\n You underline a section of the design, the flaw standing out like a neon sign once you point it out.\n\n \n\n The energy in the room shifts. Claire’s confidence falters, the hesitation flashing across her face for just a moment.\n\n \n\n You look back to your audience. One of the senior devs nods along with you.\n\n \n\n “He’s right,” they say, rubbing their chin. “We’d be adding way too much processing overhead.”\n\n \n\n Claire opens her mouth, about to argue, but then she sees it. Her shoulders drop slightly.\n\n \n\n The conversation moves on, someone building off your correction, turning it into a new approach.\n\n \n\n And just like that, Claire is out of the conversation.\n\n \n\n *\"Damn, I missed this,\"* your Shadow Self murmurs, satisfied. *\"The moment where you remind everyone that you're just... better.\"*\n\n \n\n Claire doesn’t say anything to you after the meeting.\n\n \n\n But you don’t feel bad about it. Because you were right. And that’s what matters.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "[image: ./images/HearthAndHome.png]\n\n \n\n You’re sitting at a table in The Hearth & Home - Charlton’s finest dining establishment. Where couples celebrate anniversaries, families mark milestones, and the atmosphere itself hums with quiet tradition.\n\n \n\n The restaurant is quiet but elegant, the soft glow of candlelight reflecting off polished silverware. The scent of rich sauces and wine lingers in the air, blending with the muted hum of conversation.\n\n \n\n Every table is perfectly arranged, white linens crisp and untouched, couples sitting with straight backs, speaking in hushed, polite tones. The waitresses move gracefully, all smiles and pristine uniforms, their hands folded neatly behind their backs when not in use.\n\n \n\n The very air here carries an unspoken expectation. Of manners, poise, and tradition.\n\n \n\n And yet, the moment feels stifling. You shift slightly in your chair, the collared shirt fitting snugly against your frame, the weight of your old form grounding you. You’re again. And across from you, Jennifer sits, her arms resting neatly on the table, her blue eyes sharp as she watches you.\n\n \n\n You somehow recall this moment. You remember this. This was your first couple’s fight.\n\n \n\n *\"Funny, isn’t it?\"* your Shadow Self murmurs, his voice dripping amusement. *\"How quickly things fall into place when you’re in the right skin again.\"*\n\n \n\n The candle flickers between you, and Jennifer exhales, shaking her head.\n\n \n\n “You keep acting like this is something I can just accept.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I’m not asking for the world, ,” she tells you, a restraint notable in her voice. “Just that you consider me. I’ve never been anything other than forthcoming about wanting to move from Charlton.”\n\n \n\n You feel yourself looking around. People are watching. Not obviously, not overtly, but in the way Charlton does.\n\n \n\n You can feel their eyes flicker over to your table, women whispering behind delicate hands, men occasionally glancing between their own conversations to assess the dynamic.\n\n \n\n *They’re waiting to see how you handle this. You wouldn’t want to embarrass yourself now, would you?*\n\n \n\n You keep your voice even, leaning forward slightly.\n\n \n\n “I’m not saying you have to walk away from Emily,” she says, measured. Her eyes look around the restaurant. You know her restraint isn’t just for you. “I just don’t understand why you’re so determined to stay.”\n\n \n\n “Jen,” you say, sighing. “Charlton isn’t a prison.”\n\n \n\n “That’s debatable,” she murmurs.\n\n \n\n You feel yourself huff with irritation. “You’re being ridiculous. It’s just until the end of the school year.”\n\n \n\n *\"Here it comes,\"* your Shadow Self hums, pleased. *\"She’s trying to reframe it. Make you the unreasonable one. You gonna let her?\"*\n \n\n Jennifer leans back slightly, graceful and composed, but you can see the tension in her shoulders, the restraint in her movements. “You think we’ll last that long?”\n\n \n\n You don’t look away from her, but feel the eyes of the restaurant now firmly on you. The guests at Hearth & Home are watching you both, waiting to see who will win.\n\n \n\n *What’s it gonna be? The strong, assertive man at the table… or the one who backs down?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You exhale through your nose, tilting your head slightly.\n\n \n\n “See, this is the problem,” you say smoothly, keeping your voice even. “You act like I’m the one being unreasonable, but all I’m doing is telling you the truth.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s brows snap together. “Excuse me?”\n\n \n\n “Emily’s education is the most important thing to her right now. The world isn’t going anywhere. But you’re making this an ultimatum between her graduating and our relationship. Frankly, it’s childish. You’re acting like a spoilt kid.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s lips part slightly, but you keep going.\n\n \n\n “Charlton isn’t a bad place, Jen. You need to learn how to accept the best of the situation. I’m not going anywhere until Emily graduates. If you can’t accept that, the door is over there.”\n\n \n\n You gesture to the exit. It’s a dramatic gesture, one that you know everyone has seen.\n\n \n\n Jennifer glares back at you, her cheeks reddening. She looks around towards the other patrons, who watch her with creeping smiles and raised eyebrows.\n\n \n\n “You have no idea about Charlton,” she mutters under her breath, before returning to picking at her food. But she doesn’t make an attempt to leave.\n\n \n\n The whispering in the restaurant starts up again. The watchful eyes shift, murmurs passing between couples, subtle nods exchanged between men at other tables.\n\n \n\n You realize they’re approving. Not of Jennifer. Of you.\n\n \n\n *That’s more like it. See? You just have to remind them who’s in charge.*\n\n \n\n Jennifer puts her knife and fork down, exhaling sharply, her disappointment evident. But she doesn’t argue further. Because the conversation is over. You won.\n\n \n\n Or did you?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You inhale slowly, resisting the urge to push forward. Because something about this… feels wrong.\n\n \n\n Not just the argument. The way people are watching. The way they’re waiting to see you take control.\n\n \n\n Jennifer shakes her head. “You keep talking about this place like it’s just for a year, but have you ever thought - just for a second - that maybe I want to be here? Like, this second. If I could leave tomorrow, , I would.”\n\n \n\n You lean back slightly. “I...\"\n\n \n\n Jennifer raises a brow, waiting for you to speak.\n\n \n\n “I understand,” you finally reply. “Maybe we should discuss this at home.”\n\n \n\n A moment passes between you. Jennifer’s eyes shift around the room. She’s putting up a measure of defiance. Not just from the argument. But from the patron’s judgement of her hostility to their way of life.\n\n \n\n “I just want you to be happy,” you say to her, letting the hostility drain from your voice.\n\n \n\n “Thank you,” she says after a moment, her voice softer.\n\n \n\n You glance around again. The guests at other tables are still watching. But they’re not nodding along anymore. The approval is gone.\n\n \n\n *\"Weak,\"* your Shadow Self mutters, disgusted.\n\n \n\n But for the first time in this conversation, his voice doesn’t feel like the loudest one.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Thompson's Handyman Repairs - Thompson's Office**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Office_Thompson.png]\n\n \nA cluttered and cramped office, lined with filing cabinets. An imposing desk is the centerpiece, covered in files and paperwork.\n\n \n\n Inside, Thompson drops into his leather chair with a grunt, the worn material groaning under his weight. You take a seat opposite him, the chair height at the lowest setting. You suspect, on purpose.\n\n \n\n \"Gotta admit, Phillips,\" he starts, cracking his knuckles behind his head. \"When you first showed up, I wasn’t sure you’d hack it. Thought you’d fold under pressure.\"\n\n \n\n A pause. He smirks. \"But, I’m the first to admit when I’m wrong.\"\n\n \n\n You offer him a polite smile. He’s actually the last.\n\n \n\n \"You’ve put in the work. In Charlton, that matters.\" His gaze sharpens, locking onto you like a challenge. \"Hasn’t been easy, has it? Parents off on business, brother gone to Uni. That’s a lot of responsibility for someone in a new town.\"\n\n \n\n You give a slow nod, unsure where this is going.\n\n \n\n Thompson exhales through his nose, pulling open a drawer. \"But if you pull your weight around here, Charlton looks after its own. Once you're in, you're in. And I’d say you’ve proven yourself enough that it’s time to get in.\"\n\n \n\n He slides a slip of paper across the desk. The ink is slightly smudged, but the address is clear - a house towards the outskirts of town, on the border between the community and the farming fields that surround it.\n\n \n\n \"Poker night.\" He says it like that explains everything. \"Happens at the Mayor’s place. One of the teachers - Darcy Harrow - organizes it. Just a gathering. Some of the local men, couple of the older students to show them how to play a few rounds. Maybe some beers, cigars.\" He leans back, watching your reaction.\n\n \n\n \n Thompson tilts his head slightly. \"Bring your sister along, too. It’s not exclusive for men. We’re an equal opportunity community. Some of the guys bring their girlfriends and wives to help out. Always snacks and drinks to serve.\"\n\n \n\n A beat. Then, his smirk deepens.\n\n \n\n \"Your sister seeing anyone?\" He doesn’t wait for an answer, just chuckles to himself. \"Wouldn’t be a bad way for her to show her value to some of the bachelors around town. Who knows? She might snag a man.\" He flicks a glance at you. \"Get her out of your hair.\"\n\n \n Thompson studies you for a moment, then gives an easy shrug. \"It might seem a bit manly, but there’s a role for women too. Get to meet some of the guys around the town. Share a few little jokes as you serve them a beer. Some of the guys bring their girlfriends and wives along to help out. You could meet them too.\"\n\n \n\n Then, too casually, he asks, \"You single?\"\n\n \n\n Before you can answer, he waves a hand. \"Not a bad way to show your value to some of the bachelors around town. Who knows? You might snag a man.\"\n\n \n\n Then, as an afterthought: \"Bring your sister along, too. Always room for women to offer a helping hand.\"\n\n \n \n\n Satisfied, Thompson leans back, clearly expecting you to take the offer without question. \"Come by,\" he says. \"And keep up the good work.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You stare him down. “You can puff your chest all you want, Dan. But I’m not here to play your games. And I’m not scared of your threats.”\n\n \n\n Dan’s expression hardens, just for a moment. The smirk still lingers at the edges of his mouth, but the warmth behind it has frozen over.\n\n \n\n “Think you’re a big shot now,” he says slowly, tone shifting to something more menacing. “All assertive and confident. Trying to be like Thompson? He respects a bit of alpha male in his workforce.”\n\n “Oh, you’ve got fire,” he says slowly, tone shifting to something more menacing. “Thompson must like that. He’s got a thing for a bit of cheek.”\n \n \n\n He steps closer, lowering his voice.\n\n \n\n “But he’s got a short thread, Phillips. One slip. One wrong word. One off day. That’s all it takes.”\n\n \n\n He leans back, flashing his teeth in a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes.\n\n \n\n “And when it happens? I’ll be waiting. Cigar in one hand, whisky in the other. Watching the show.”\n\n \n\n His words linger like smoke in the air as he turns and strolls back to his desk - no longer bothering to block your path, but making it clear that whatever game he’s playing… you’re on his board.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You meet his gaze, keeping your tone calm. “I’ll be sure to mention your name to Mr. Thompson. Let him know who’s been helping me settle in.”\n\n \n\n Dan’s grin stretches wide. Smug, satisfied, and far too pleased with himself.\n\n \n\n “That’s what I like to hear,” he says, giving your shoulder a mock-patronizing pat. “Smart move, Phillips. Very smart.”\n\n \n\n He walks past you slowly, tapping your desk twice with the flat of his palm. “Good to know you understand how things work around here. There’s a pecking order in every part of Charlton. Thompson’s Repairs is no different.”\n\n \n\n He turns back, clearly enjoying himself. “And around here? I’m the head hen.”\n\n \n\n The sentence hangs awkwardly in the air. You blink. *Surely, he meant rooster?*\n\n \n\n But Dan, oblivious, just laughs at his own joke and strolls off. And yet, even with the idiotic slip, his next words still manage to land like a warning.\n\n \n\n “Stick to your lane, Phillips. You’ll be just fine. Stray too far from it…” He whistles, low and casual, “...well, things have a way of getting messy.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You square your stance. \"This isn’t fair. I don’t think this is the right way to handle it.\"\n\n \n\n Thompson stops mid-stride. His head tilts slightly, like he can’t believe what he just heard.\n\n \n\n \"You think you’re in a position to argue with me?\" His voice drops, dangerously quiet. \"You think I’m giving you a choice?\"\n\n \n\n His fingers twitch, like he’s resisting the urge to point straight in your face again.\n\n \n\n \"This is me being generous, Phillips. You don’t want this? Fine. I know every business owner in this town. You think they’ll hire someone who can’t handle a simple booking system?\"\n\n \n\n His smirk fades completely, replaced with something colder, sharper.\n\n \n\n \"What happens to that sister of yours if you’re out on the street, huh?\"\n\n \n\n The office is so silent you can hear your own pulse.\n\n \n\n Thompson exhales, taking a step back. His tone shifts into mock amusement, but there’s nothing funny about it.\n\n \n\n \"Wednesday and Friday lunchtimes. You’ll be at that front desk. We’ll review the situation if your work improves.\"\n\n \n\n He sneers. \"If you don’t find yourself enjoying it, of course. Some people just fit the chair better.\"\n\n \n\n With that, he stomps back into his office, the tension in the room finally breaking as he slams the door shut.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You grit your teeth, swallowing the urge to push back, and nod. \"Understood.\"\n\n \n\n Something in Thompson’s expression eases. Just a fraction. His anger is still there, but now it’s laced with something approaching approval.\n\n \n\n \"Good,\" he says. \"Wednesday and Friday lunchtimes. Be there. And if your work improves, we’ll review it.\"\n\n \n\n Then, smirking faintly, he adds, \"Unless, of course, you find that the receptionist chair suits you better.\"\n\n \n\n He turns on his heel and stalks back into his office, his anger spent. For now.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You get ready in silence, stepping out into the grey Charlton morning. The streets feel colder than usual. Watchful, like the town knows something you don’t.\n\n \n\n You push open the door to Thompson’s Repairs. The bell above the entrance sounds too loud in the stillness.\n\n \n\n Annie looks up from behind the desk, but doesn’t greet you. No wink, no wave. Just a polite, tight smile. Then she looks away.\n\n \n\n You move past her and enter the main office. Dan is at his desk, but he doesn’t look up. He sees you. You know he does. But his eyes stay fixed on the screen in front of him.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n **Thompson's Handyman Repairs - Thompson's Office**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Office_Thompson.png]\n\n \n\n You step into Thompson’s office. The door clicks shut behind you.\n\n \n\n He doesn’t look up immediately. Just finishes making a note in the ledger on his desk. When he does raise his eyes to meet yours, they’re devoid of fire. Somehow, that’s worse.\n\n \n\n He leans back in his chair. \"This isn’t working out, Phillips.\"\n\n \n\n His voice is quiet. Measured. Like he’s already made the decision.\n\n \n\n \"The booking system’s still riddled with issues. Suppliers aren’t getting orders. Some have stopped taking our calls. We’ve got addresses missing from job sheets. I’ve got Clive telling me he hasn’t been paid in two weeks.\"\n\n \n\n He shakes his head slowly. \"It’s basic. Foundational. And it’s not happening.\"\n\n \n\n Thompson exhales and leans forward, folding his hands on the desk.\n\n \n\n \"Annie needs some time away from the front desk. I’ve been thinking of promoting her to a more… internal role. PA work.\"\n\n \n\n There’s a brief silence as that lands.\n\n \n\n \"In the meantime, I can get Theodore back on freelance. He won’t leave that caravan of his, but he can work remote. While he handles the code, you’ll cover reception.\"\n\n \n\n He lifts his chin.\n\n \n\n \"If you can prove you belong here, if you show me you understand what responsibility looks like, I’ll consider moving you back onto development. Full time.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <> \n \n You nod, keeping your expression neutral. There’s no room to negotiate.\n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t thank you. He just watches you a moment longer, then finally says:\n\n \n\n \"Take the rest of the day. Think about things.\"\n\n \n\n He opens a drawer, pulls out a set of keys, and places them on the desk.\n\n \n\n \"Tomorrow morning. You’ll be behind the reception desk.\"\n\n \n\n You pick up the keys in silence and step out.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You square your shoulders. “Give me another chance. I know I can turn this around.”\n\n \n\n Thompson stares at you. Unblinking, unreadable. His voice stays level, but something flickers in his jaw.\n\n \n\n \"This is your other chance, Phillips.\"\n\n \n\n He leans forward slightly, his voice still calm but laced with steel.\n\n \n\n \"You either accept the position… or you walk out that door.\"\n\n \n\n You think of Emily. Of the rent. Of what comes next if you leave. You swallow.\n\n \n\n “…Fine. I’ll take it.”\n\n \n\n Thompson nods once.\n\n \n\n \"Take the rest of the day.\" He places the keys to reception on the desk. \"Be here first thing tomorrow.\"\n\n \n\n You take the keys and leave, knowing you've barely managed to hang on.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n As you step out of his office, the weight settles over you. You’re on your last warning. One wrong move, and you're out.\n\n \n\n You need to talk to someone. Someone who matters. Emily comes to mind immediately.\n\n \n\n You should really speak to your sister about how serious this has become.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You rub your forehead and let out a slow, exhausted breath. \"I’m not sure, Em. I need to go over our finances. See what we can cut, if we can stretch what little we’ve got left.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily doesn't say anything for a moment. Then, slowly, she walks over and rests a hand on your arm.\n\n \n\n \"Maybe I could find a part-time job? Just something after school, or weekends. I mean... I’m not useless.\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"You need to focus on school.\"\n\n \n\n \"I will,\" she insists. \"But we’re in this together, right? We’ll figure it out. I’ll head to school now.\"\n\n \n\n She grabs her bag, offering a small, encouraging smile. \"We can talk properly when I get back.\"\n\n \n\n The door clicks softly shut behind her. You exhale, already dreading the numbers you're about to face.\n\n \n Emily stares at you for a moment before scoffing. \"Seriously?\" Her voice rises, a mix of fear and anger. \"You better *think* of something. I can’t deal with this. Not on top of everything else!\"\n\n \n\n She storms past you, grabbing her schoolbag with a frustrated swipe.\n\n \n\n \"I’ve got enough pressure from everyone at school. If I come home and find out we’re being kicked out too -- \"\n\n \n\n The door slams before she finishes her sentence. You're left alone in the quiet house, the weight of her panic pressing down like a stone on your chest.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You spend the day reviewing your finances, spread across the kitchen table. Bills, statements, whatever scraps of income you can find. It doesn’t take long to realise the truth: things are bad. Really bad.\n\n \n\n Your parents had made it clear when they left that there wouldn’t be much help from them. Getting Brock into university had drained nearly everything. What little remains in your account won’t last more than a few weeks.\n\n \n\n By the time the sun dips low, casting amber light through the window, you hear the front door open and Emily step inside.\n\n \n\n She drops her bag by the stairs and looks over at you. \"How bad is it?\"\n\n \n\n You exhale. \"It’s not great. We don’t have much. We’ll need to find ways to bring in money around town. Just to keep things ticking over.\"\n\n \n\n Emily frowns. \"What about getting another job?\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"Programmers aren’t exactly in demand in Charlton.\"\n\n \n\n She nods. “I guess it’s tough when Charlton still thinks fax machines are cutting-edge. What about remote work?\"\n\n \n\n You smirk a little. “I can’t even get a web page to load quickly here. I don’t think Charlton was designed for online jobs.”\n\n \n\n Emily grimaces. “I guess we’re left with only a few options.”\n\n \n\n Staring at her, you notice a strange look on Emily's face. She is bracing herself to speak.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n \n Emily gives a small shrug. \"At least I’m already bringing in a little from the hotel. Maybe I can try harder for tips.\"\n\n \n\n You frown. \"I don’t want you to take on the burden.\"\n\n \n\n \"We need money,\" she says again. Simple. Undeniable.\n\n \n She pauses. \"I could get a part-time job. At the hotel. As a maid or something.\"\n\n \n\n You hesitate. \"Em -\"\n\n \n\n \"We need money,\" she says, firm but calm. \"I’ll ask tomorrow.\"\n\n \n \n \n\n There’s a quiet moment, then she adds, \"Maybe there’s a way the amulet could help.\"\n\n \n\n You glance up. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n \n\n \"Well… maybe you don’t need to do your job. You could do someone else’s.\"\n\n \n\n Your brow furrows. \"You’re not seriously suggesting I steal someone’s job? And their wages?\"\n\n \n\n Emily shakes her head. \"No. Let them keep their pay. But some jobs in Charlton come with perks. Tips. Gratitude. A little extra slipped your way. Maybe you can use the amulet to become someone who earns those things too.\"\n\n \n\n You say nothing at first. You can’t help but think of Florence. Andrea. People working themselves to the bone just to scrape by. Would it be right to step into their shoes, even for a day? Even just for the tips?\n\n \n\n But then again... survival is survival.\n\n \n\n “I’ll consider it,” you tell Emily. “For now, that’s enough worrying for one day.”\n\n \n\n She nods, but remains silent. Eventually, Emily tells you that she's ready to call it a night. She quietly takes the stairs up to her room, leaving you alone.\n\n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n <Emily will need to take on jobs around town.\">>",

He's been very insistent. Doesn't want you... seeing anyone else.\"\n \n \n\n She looks down at the floor, avoiding your eyes.\n\n \n “How's it going at the hotel?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “Quiet,\" Andrea says, giving a grimace. \"Even with the carnival in town, there's not many people passing through. Of course, the locals make the most of rooms on the first floor.\"\n\n \n\n She gulps, as if suddenly realisation has struck her. \"Not that it's a problem. I'm sure it's for important meetings. Business meetings. Nothing else.\"\n\n \n\n \"Do you think I could get up there?\" you ask\n\n \n\n \"I can't let you go up there,\" Andrea tells you. \"I'm sorry, Jen. Believe me though, you don't want to go up there.\"\n \n \n “Can you tell me a little bit about the hotel?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “Charlton Hotel has been around as long as the town,” she says, seemingly parroting a line that has been instilled into her. “It’s been owned by the Sermon family for the last century. Mr. Sermon is adamant that we offer the best service to all of our guests.”\n\n \n\n “It doesn’t seem like you would get many customers,” you state. It’s enough to make her look around again.\n\n \n\n “There’s not that many people that come through Charlton,” she says, before lowering her voice. “But the town’s residents make good use of the hotel.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. Andrea almost takes a step back from your reaction. “Would there be anything else?”, she asks. \n \n \n “Can you tell me a little bit about the hotel?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “Charlton Hotel has been around as long as the town,” she says, seemingly parroting a line that has been instilled into her. “It’s been owned by the Sermon family for the last century.

Although the real world isn't much better.\"\n\n \n\n You frown. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n \n\n \"Do you remember when Coach Beach made me clean after school?\" she asks you. \"After I twisted my ankle in PE? I didn't think I'd be still cleaning on my hands and knees after I graduated.\"\n\n \n\n When you don't reply, Andrea continues. \"It's funny. I tried to go unseen at school. Kept myself out of trouble. I didn't think that would be how I'd live for the rest of my life. At least at Fresh Pot, Ron isn't so bad to you.”\n\n \n\n The front door creaks and Andrea jumps. “I really should get back, Flo” she tells you, returning to a professional tone.\n\n \n “Do you ever think about school?” you ask Andrea. \n\n \n\n “Sometimes,\" she tells you after some consideration. \"It's not something that I like thinking about. Although the real world isn't much better.\"\n\n \n\n You frown. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n \n\n \"I don't know if you heard about when Coach Beach made me clean after school?\" she asks you. \"After I twisted my ankle in PE? I didn't think I'd be still cleaning on my hands and knees after I graduated.\"\n\n \n\n When you don't reply, Andrea continues. \"It's funny. I tried to go unseen at school. I didn't think you even knew who I was. Just kept myself out of trouble. But cleaning the gym... I wouldn't have thought that would be how I'd live for the rest of my life. I wish I'd found something else when I graduated. There can't be a worse job in Charlton that this.\"\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. Andrea's eyes widen and shakes her head, nervously. \"Oh Annie, I'm sorry. I didn't --\"\n\n \n\n \"It's okay,\" you say. She smiles, but avoids your eyes.\n\n \n “Do you ever think about school?” you ask Andrea. \n\n \n\n “Sometimes,\" she tells you after some consideration. \"It's not something that I like thinking about.

Kept myself out of trouble. I didn't think that would be how I'd live for the rest of my life. At least at Evans, things aren't so bad to you.”\n\n \n\n You smile, but can't help reflecting on Jennifer's experience at work. And what she goes through every day. Just like Andrea.\n \n \n\n The front door creaks and Andrea jumps. “I really should get back” she tells you, returning to a professional tone.\n \n \n \n “Did you go to school here?” you ask Andrea. \n\n \n\n “Yes. Charlton Upper,” she tells you quickly. “I graduated a year ago.”\n\n \n\n “Did you enjoy it?”\n\n \n\n For the first time you see the girl underneath the shadowy black make-up. “It was... school,” she says. “They taught me... a lot.”\n\n \n\n “My sister goes there. Any advice?”\n\n \n\n She purses her lips. “Try to go unseen,” she says. “It can be a hard place. Especially for girls.”\n\n \n\n The front door creaks and Andrea jumps. “Do you have any other questions?” she asks, returning to her professional tone.\n\n \n “Did you go to school here?” you ask Andrea. \n\n \n\n “Yes. Charlton Upper,” she tells you quickly. “I graduated a year ago.”\n\n \n\n “Did you enjoy it?”\n\n \n\n For the first time you see the girl underneath the shadowy black make-up. “It was… school,” she says. “They taught me… a lot.”\n\n \n\n “My sister goes there.

Especially for girls.”\n\n \n\n The front door creaks and Andrea jumps. “Do you have any other questions?” she asks, returning to her professional tone.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \"Hey Andrea,\" you say. \"I was wondering if you could do me a favour.\"\n\n \n\n \"I really should get back to work,\" Andrea replies, looking around. \"Can it wait?\"\n\n \n\n You smile. \"It will only take a minute. Come on, let's go back to the locker room. Where we won't be disturbed.\"\n\n \n\n Andrea glances back to the locker room door. You can see the hesitation on her face.\n\n \n\n \"Alright\", she sighs. \"If it's just a minute.\"\n\n \n\n She skips forward on her heels towards the locker room door. You follow her.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Hey Andrea,” you say. “Maybe I shouldn’t have kept your passport. That was mean.”\n\n \n\n Andrea gives you a dark look, but doesn’t comment.\n\n \n\n “Do you want to go back to the locker room and discuss it?”, you say, trying to smile.\n\n \n \n She gives you a glare, but sighs. \"Alright, Flo. Let's go.\"\n\n \n\n Without saying another word, she walks over to the staff room door, punches in the code, and holds it open for you.\n \n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Hey Andrea,\" you say. \"About your passport...\"\n\n \n\n \"What passport?\" she replies. \"I don't own a passport. Foreign countries are dangerous.\"\n\n \n\n You hesitate, recalling the spell that wiped her memories. \"Do you think we could talk about it in the locker room?\"\n\n \n\n “I don’t think it would be appropriate to take guests back there,” she says quietly. \n\n \n\n You nod, holding back the frustration.\n\n \n\n *After wiping Andrea's memories of the passport, you have lost leverage to lure her back to the locker room. You'll need to find a way to win over her trust before she's willing to break the rules of the hotel.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n “Hey Andrea,” you say. “I found this in the hotel. Does it belong to you?”\n\n \n\n You take out Andrea's passport. Her eyes widen at the sight of it and her professional demeanour slips away.\n\n \n\n \"Where did you get that?\" she exclaims.\n\n \n\n \"Just lying around,\" you lie. “Do you want to go back to the locker room and discuss it?”, you say, trying to smile.\n\n \n\n She gives you a nervous look. You wonder how many people have asked to see her privately. Fortunately, the connotations aren't as bad coming from a woman. At least, in this town.\n\n She looks to the floor, defeated. You can guess what she thinks you mean, especially from someone in this town. \n\n \n\n “Sure,” she says. “Let’s go.”\n\n \n\n Without saying another word, she walks over to the staff room door, punches in the code, and holds it open for you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Hey Andrea,” you say. “Maybe I shouldn’t have kept your passport. That was mean.”\n\n \n\n Andrea gives you a dark look, but doesn’t comment.\n\n \n\n “Do you want to go back to the locker room and discuss it?”, you say, trying to smile.\n\n \n\n She gives you a nervous look.

But -\" She looks you up and down, then bites her lip. \"It's quite a demanding job, though. Are you sure you want to apply? Aren't you still at school?\"\n\n \n\n You shrug. \"Final year. I can work evenings and the weekends.\"\n\n \n\n \"But you're eighteen, right?\" Andrea asks, pointedly. \"Mr. Sermon has a strict policy about his staff. In many areas.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, trying to feign innocence. *You can imagine why he is so strict.* \"Sure. No problem there.\"\n\n \n\n Andrea gives you another long look. \"Alright,\" she says, with hesitancy. \"It's mainly helping out around the hotel. Cleaning. Pierre in the kitchen really could do with some help. It's just me currently.\" She looks to the floor for a moment. \"I can only do my best.\"\n\n \n\n \"It doesn't pay well,\" she adds. \"But it will give you a bit of pocket money. If you're interested, speak to Lennox.\" She gives you a small smile. \"I'd really appreciate the help.\"\n\n \n You put on a smile as you begin to speak. \"I saw in the Charlton Gazette that you're looking for staff?\"\n\n \n\n Andrea looks at you as you ask the question, then winces. \"Yes. But --\" She looks you up and down again. \"I'm not sure that.. well, Lennox is a bit fussy on who he hires.\"\n\n \n\n You tilt your head. \"What do you mean? What does he look for?\"\n\n \n\n She bites her lip, eyes trying not to meet yours. \"Only that Mr. Sermon has a strict policy about his staff. In many areas.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, trying to feign innocence. *You can imagine why he is so strict.* \"Why do you not think I'd pass?\"\n\n \n\n Andrea gives you a long look. \"Believe me,\" she says, with hesitancy. \"I know.\" She sighs, and when she next speaks her voice is lowered. \"Take this as a blessing. I'm doing you a favour.\" She looks to the floor for a moment. \"Even though I could use some help.\"\n\n \n\n You should feel indignant at Andrea's dismissal of you. But giving her a look, you know that she knows all too well of what Sermon is looking for in his maids. And if you don't meet his requirements, maybe someone else will.\n \n \n You put on a smile as you begin to speak. \"You mentioned an advert?\"\n\n \n\n Andrea eyes widen at your question. \"Yes! But --\" She looks you up and down, then bites her lip. \"I'm not sure it's right for you.\"\n\n \n\n \"What was it for?\", you ask.\n\n \n\n \"A job. Here, at the hotel,\" she tells you. \"Mainly cleaning. Pierre in the kitchen really could do with some help. It's just me currently.\" She looks to the floor for a moment. \"I can only do my best.\"\n\n \n\n \"It's quite a demanding job, though,\" she adds. \"Are you sure you want to apply? Aren't you still at school?\"\n\n \n\n You shrug. \"Final year.

If you're interested, speak to Lennox.\" She gives you a small smile. \"I'd really appreciate the help.\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You look around the lobby to ensure no one is watching, then turn back to stare at Andrea.\n\n \n\n You feel butterflies in your stomach as you mentally stir your magical soup within your body. You take a deep breath, bathing the air inside your lungs in arcane energies.\n\n \n\n And slowly, almost delicately, you let out your breath. The magic infused within the elements highlights a thin trail of air drifting towards Andrea's face.\n\n \n\n She stares back at you, waiting for you to speak, unaware of the magical energies she subconsciously inhales. Then her eyes glaze over as the spell begins to work.\n\n \n\n \"I can go upstairs, can't I?\" you ask Andrea.\n\n \n\n She looks to the stairs, then back to you. \"Upstairs is for guest only,\" she whispers.\n\n \n\n \"But you won't tell anyone, will you? Our little secret.\"\n\n \n\n She seems to blush. \"Our little secret.\"\n\n \n\n She gestures you towards the stairs, looking around to make sure no one sees. Without another word, you ascend to the first floor.\n \n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Andrea has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \"Listen Andrea,\" you begin. \"I need to get upstairs. And you're going to let me.\"\n\n \n\n Andrea stares at you, pursing her lips. \"I'm afraid I can't let you do that.\"\n\n \n\n \"And what will your boss say when I tell him you've been denying guests important visitors.\"\n\n \n\n She shakes her head. \"But Mr. Thompson isn't here right now!\"\n \n She stares back at you for a moment, judging you. \"You know someone staying here?\"\n\n \n\n \"Who cares?\" you reply. \"I'll tell him anyway.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes widen. \"Please. Don't\"\n\n \n\n \"Let me go, then,\" you say.\n\n \n\n A moment passes, then Andrea moves to the side of the stairwell. \"Go ahead,\" she says quietly.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \"Listen Andrea,\" you begin. \"I need to get upstairs. And you're going to let me.\"\n\n \n\n Andrea stares at you, pursing her lips. \"I'm afraid I can't let you do that.\"\n\n \n\n \"And what would your boss think, if I told him that you weren't being nice to guests?\"\n\n \n\n She stares back at you for a moment, judging you. Then you see a small smile form momentarily. \"There's nothing you can say that will be worse than if he finds out I let you upstairs.\"\n\n \n\n When you don't reply, she looks up at you directly. \"Go ahead. Just try.\"\n\n \n\n She watches you, unflinching. If you try to go upstairs, you can tell Lennox will be informed straight away.\n\n \n\n Andrea stares back at you, unsmiling. Eventually, you step back. She gives you a polite smile, then returns back to her duties.\n\n \n\n You watch her for a while, but she doesn't move away from the lobby. Instead she periodically looks up at you. Watching.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \"Hey Andrea,\" you begin. \"All the doors upstairs are locked. And I need to get in to them.\"\n\n \n\n The maid frowns, looking a little scared. \"That's not allowed. You can't just go into people's rooms like that.\"\n\n \n\n \"You can,\" you reply. \"I bet you've got a key to all the rooms. Now you're going to give it to me.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes widen. She shakes her head quickly. \"I can't do that.\"\n\n \n\n \"You can,\" you tell her. \"And you're going to. Otherwise I will make your life hard. Very hard.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes widen. \"Please. Don't make me do this.\"\n\n \n\n \"Hand it over,\" you say flatly.\n\n \n\n She hesitates, meeting your eyes to judge your convictions. Then, sighing, she reaches around her throat and pulls out a necklace with a key on. She holds it out silently.\n \n \n\n \"Thank you,\" you say, smiling. As you take the key, she doesn't reply.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \"Hey Andrea,\" you begin, trying to sound threatening. \"All the doors upstairs are locked. And, er, I need to get in to them.\"\n\n \n\n The maid frowns, looking at you. \"That's not allowed. You can't just go into people's rooms like that.\"\n\n \n\n You grimace. She doesn't appear to be threatened at all. \"You can,\" you reply. \"If I had your key, then I could do that. So you could just give me it.\"\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, slowly. \"I can't do that.\"\n\n \n\n \"Why not?,\" you ask. \"I can make your life tricky.\" Seeing her skepticism, you try to push harder. \"Like, getting in trouble tricky. Trouble that you, er, wouldn't want to get into.\"\n\n \n\n She gives you a befuddled look. \"Like what?\"\n\n \n\n \"Big trouble,\" you say, hearing the flatness in your voice. \"Trouble that is, er, big.\"\n\n \n\n Her frown narrows. There is a hint of a smile almost forming on her lips. \"I don't think this is an appropriate conversation. I need to get back to my work.\"\n \n \n\n She turns away from you, returning to her duties. You watch her for some time, trying to cast menacing looks in her direction. She looks back with an expression of bewilderment.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You look around the lobby to ensure no one is watching, then turn back to stare at Andrea.\n\n \n\n You feel butterflies in your stomach as you mentally stir your magical soup within your body. You take a deep breath, bathing the air inside your lungs in arcane energies.\n\n \n\n And slowly, almost delicately, you let out your breath. The magic infused within the elements highlights a thin trail of air drifting towards Andrea's face.\n\n \n\n She stares back at you, waiting for you to speak, unaware of the magical energies she subconsciously inhales. Then her eyes glaze over as the spell begins to work.\n\n \n\n Andrea stares up at you, waiting. No smile comes to her face. Her eyes appear to grow as she stares at you, waiting for you to speak. You notice her front teeth nervously digging into her bottom lip.\n\n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Andrea has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \"I really need to speak to you,\" you say, leaning in close to her. \"And it needs to be in private.\"\n\n \n\n She stares back up at you, her face only inches from yours. \"It's not allowed,\" she murmurs.\n\n \n\n \"It won't take long,\" you say, injecting as much menace as you can. \"And you wouldn't want someone telling Lennox that you were being unpleasant to guests, would you?\"\n \n \n \"Stop it, Flo,\" she asks meekly.\n\n \n\n \"We need to talk,\" you say flatly. \"Now.\"\n\n \n \n She sighs, just a little. \"You could have just asked.\"\n\n \n\n You smile at her, thinly. She shakes her head. \"Alright. Let's go. Quickly.\"\n\n \n \"You wouldn't!\" Andrea exclaims.\n\n \n\n \"I think Lennox would be very interested in hearing about your non-compliance when it comes to guests requests.\"\n\n \n\n Andrea grits her teeth. \"What do you want?\"\n\n \n\n You smile. \"Let's discuss it. In private.\"\n\n \n\n The young woman shudders, but her shoulders slump as she relents. Wordlessly, she gestures towards the locker room.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \"I really need to speak to you,\" you say, leaning in close to her. \"We should go somewhere private.\"\n\n \n\n She stares back up at you, her face only inches from yours. She takes a step back. \"It's not allowed.\"\n\n \n\n \"No, I mean it,\" you say, a little unsure of yourself. \"Um, you wouldn't want me to tell Lennox that you aren't very good at cleaning, would you?\"\n \n \n \n Andrea laughs. Right from her belly. The laugh turns into a chuckle and despite your attempts to cast a stern face, she doesn't stop.\n\n \n\n \"As if Lennox doesn't already think that,\" she spits out between chuckles. \"Believe me, he finds worse things to chide me over just as part of my normal day.\"\n\n \n\n \"Maybe I'll say something even worse,\" you reply.\n\n \n\n She starts laughing again. \"Oh my, what would you say? Maybe you'll tell him that I can't walk in these heels, or I messed up an order in the kitchen. He'd be shocked to hear that.\"\n\n \n\n After gaining some composure, Andrea looks at you. \"Believe me, there's nothing you could say that could make my life any worse.\"\n\n \n\n She stares back at you with a measure of defiance. Then returns to her work. For once, ignoring you.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>",

We can talk.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"Hey Annie, I was wondering if you'd like to go for another drink this evening?\"\n\n \n\n Annie's eyes sparkle and she grins. \"I'd love to, . I'll see you at McTafey's?\"\n\n \n\n You nod. She smiles. \"Great! I'll see you there.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You clear your throat, trying not to sound too eager. \"Hey, Annie,\" you say, leaning casually on her desk. \"I was wondering... any chance I could borrow the key to the shop? Just for a little while?\"\n\n You clear your throat, trying not to sound too eager. \"Hey, Annie,\" you say, leaning casually on the counter. \"I was wondering... any chance I could borrow the key to the shop? Just for a little while?\"\n\n \n\n Annie's lips curves into a teasing smile. \"Oh, , I’d love to help you out,\" she says, her voice lilting with mock seriousness. \"But you know, a girl’s gotta have her secrets.\" She twirls a strand of her hair around her finger, her blue eyes sparkling as they meet yours. \"Besides, what would Mr. Thompson say if he found out I was handing out keys to handsome men? Probably wouldn’t go over so well.\"\n\n \n\n She steps a little closer, her tone softening just a touch. \"Tell you what, though. If you really need something in there, maybe we can figure it out together. Just don’t go thinking you can charm me into trouble.\" Her grin widens, the playful glint in her eyes making it hard to tell if she’s joking or challenging you.\n\n \n You lean on her desk, smiling at her. \"Annie, would you mind lending me the key to Thompson’s office? I promise I’ll be careful.\"\n\n You lean on the counter, smiling at her. \"Annie, would you mind lending me the key to Thompson’s office? I promise I’ll be careful.\"\n\n \n\n Annie listens to your request, tapping her nails lightly against her desk as you finish. \"Oh, , I totally get why you’d want the key,\" she says, her tone sympathetic but firm. \"But, you know... some things are best left off-limits. Call it an unofficial house rule.\" She shrugs lightly, her expression apologetic but still friendly.\n\n \n\n \"Don’t get me wrong. I trust you. It’s just that if Thompson found out...\" Her voice trails off, and she lets out a soft laugh. \"Let’s just say I’d rather not end up on his bad side. You understand, right?\" She reaches out, giving your arm a light squeeze. \"Look, if there’s something in there you need, maybe we can figure out another way. You know I’ve got your back.\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n You lean in slightly, lowering your voice to ensure only Annie hears you. \"Annie, about that key... I think you’ll want to hear me out before saying no.\"\n\n \n\n Her bright smile falters for the first time, and her eyes narrow slightly. \"What’s this about?\" she asks, her tone still playful but with a wary edge.\n\n \n\n \"You know exactly what I mean,\" you say, your voice calm but firm. \"The hotel room. Lunchtime. You and Mr. Thompson. I didn’t think you’d want everyone knowing about your little... meetings.\"\n\n \n\n Her cheeks flush, and she exhales sharply, crossing her arms as her smile disappears completely. \"You really don’t know when to quit, do you?\" she says, her voice low and clipped. She glances around the room, her unease clear as she leans closer to you.\n\n \n\n \n \"Fine,\" she mutters after a long pause. She pulls the key from her pocket and slams it onto the desk between you. \"Take it. But you’d better keep your mouth shut. If I hear even one word about this, you’ll regret it.\" She steps back, her blue eyes now icy as she watches you take the key.\n\n \"Fine,\" she mutters after a long pause. She pulls the key from her pocket and slams it onto the counter between you. \"Take it. But you’d better keep your mouth shut. If I hear even one word about this, you’ll regret it.\" She steps back, her blue eyes now icy as she watches you take the key.\n\n \n You cross your arms and meet Annie’s bright, curious gaze with a serious expression. \"Annie, I need the key to the shop,\" you say plainly. \"And I think you know why you should give it to me.\"\n\n \n\n Her smile falters, confusion flickering across her face. \"What are you talking about?\" she asks, her voice tinged with hesitation.\n\n \n\n You lean in slightly, keeping your voice quiet but firm. \"The hotel room. Lunchtime. You and Mr. Thompson. I think we both know what’s going on.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes widen for the briefest moment, and then her expression hardens. \"What?\" she says sharply.\n\n \n\n You keep your tone steady. \"What matters is what happens next. And I’m guessing you don’t want anyone else to know, either.\"\n\n \n\n Her breath catches for a moment, and her cheerful facade crumbles completely. \"You’re really going to do this?\" she says quietly, her voice a mix of anger and disappointment. \"I thought you were better than this.\"\n\n \n\n After a long pause, she pulls the key from her pocket, her fingers trembling slightly as she sets it down. \"Here. But don’t think for a second that I’ll forget this. You might’ve gotten your way today, but this?\" She gestures between the two of you. \"This doesn’t happen again.\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n <>\n\n \n \n \n The spell settles over Annie like a soft ripple in the air, and you see it take hold in the way her smile falters, just for an instant. Her fingers tighten slightly on the edge of her desk, and her gaze lingers on you a little too long before she blinks and shakes her head, as though brushing off a stray thought.\n\n The spell settles over Annie like a soft ripple in the air, and you see it take hold in the way her smile falters, just for an instant. Her fingers tighten slightly on the edge of the counter, and her gaze lingers on you a little too long before she blinks and shakes her head, as though brushing off a stray thought.\n\n \n\n \"You’re... something else, you know that?\" she says with a nervous laugh, her tone just a fraction quieter than usual. She reaches into her pocket, pulling out the key, her movements slower than normal. \"I don’t usually do this kind of thing, but... I guess it’s fine. I can trust you, can't I ?\"\n\n \n\n Her voice wavers slightly as she places the key into your hand, her fingertips brushing yours in a way that feels almost deliberate before she quickly pulls back. \"Just don’t tell anyone, alright? I can’t have people thinking I’m reckless or... or something like that,\" she says, her words tumbling out in a rush.\n\n \n\n For a moment, her bright blue eyes meet yours, and something unspoken flickers there - something she doesn’t seem to fully understand herself. She clears her throat, her cheerful tone returning with practiced ease. \"Anyway! Don’t keep me in suspense. What’s your big plan with this thing?\"\n\n \n\n Her laugh is light and easy, but there’s a faint redness to her cheeks as she glances away, her hand brushing through her hair in a nervous gesture she rarely makes.\n\n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Annie has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n \n You step closer, your shadow falling over the desk as your voice drops to a low, steady tone. \"Annie, give me the key. Now,\" you say, each word deliberate and cold.\n\n \n\n Her smile vanishes instantly, and she straightens up, her fingers curling slightly on her desk as if to anchor herself. \"Excuse me?\" she says, her voice quieter but edged with disbelief.\n\n \n\n \"You heard me,\" you say, leaning just enough to make your presence unmistakable. \"I’m not asking. I need that key, and you’re going to give it to me. Right now.\"\n\n \n\n For a moment, the room is silent except for the faint tap of her nails against the desk. She glances at the door, then back at you, her usual confidence replaced with a wary edge. Slowly, she reaches into her pocket and pulls out the key, dropping it between you.\n \n \n You step closer, your shadow falling over the counter as your voice drops to a low, steady tone. \"Annie, give me the key.

She glances at the door, then back at you, her usual confidence replaced with a wary edge. Slowly, she reaches into her pocket and pulls out the key, dropping it between you.\n\n \n \n\n \"Take it,\" she says curtly, her voice clipped. \"But don’t you ever pull something like this on me again. We’re done, you hear me? Don’t talk to me unless you want a real fight next time.\"\n\n \n\n She steps back, crossing her arms as her piercing gaze follows you out the door. The warmth and charm you’d come to expect from Annie are gone, replaced by cold disdain.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You take a deep breath, trying to summon all the authority you can muster. \"Annie,\" you say, your voice just a little too loud and shaky, \"give me the key. I mean it.\"\n\n \n\n She blinks at you, her head tilting slightly as if she’s waiting for you to continue. When you don’t, she raises an eyebrow. \"Wait,\" she says slowly, her lips twitching. \"Are you... trying to intimidate me?\"\n\n \n\n \"I’m not trying,\" you reply, straightening your back. \"I’m telling you. Hand over the key. Now.\"\n\n \n\n \n Annie stares at you for a moment longer before a sudden laugh bursts out of her. \"Oh my God,\" she wheezes, doubling over and clutching the desk. \"That’s... wow. Okay. You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that.\" She stands upright, brushing a tear from her eye, her grin so wide it’s almost painful to look at.\n\n Annie stares at you for a moment longer before a sudden laugh bursts out of her. \"Oh my God,\" she wheezes, doubling over and clutching the counter. \"That’s... wow. Okay. You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that.\" She stands upright, brushing a tear from her eye, her grin so wide it’s almost painful to look at.\n\n \n\n \"You know,\" she continues, gesturing toward your stance, \"if you’re going to try the scary act, maybe don’t look like you’re about to faint. And don’t stammer. That really kills the vibe.\"\n\n \n\n You glance down, realizing that your hands are trembling slightly. \"I’m not stammering!\" you blurt out.\n\n \n\n Annie bursts into fresh laughter, shaking her head as she waves you off. \"Oh, sweetheart, stop. You’re gonna make me cry again, and not the good kind.\" She turns back to her work, still chuckling as she adds, \"A for effort, though. Really. That was cute.\"\n\n \n\n Her laughter echoes in your ears as you walk away, your attempt at menace thoroughly dismantled.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n \n The spell weaves through the air, settling over Annie with a barely perceptible shift. For a moment, her bright smile falters, her hand freezing mid-gesture as she looks at you. Her gaze lingers just a beat too long, her blue eyes flicking away and then back again as though she’s trying to brush off some unspoken thought.\n\n \n\n \"You’ve got a... a way about you,\" she says, her voice quieter than usual, the words tumbling out as though she didn’t plan to say them. She fidgets slightly, brushing a strand of golden hair behind her ear. \"Not many people can, you know... keep my attention like this.\" She lets out a soft, awkward laugh, her usual charm slipping just enough to reveal a flicker of uncertainty beneath.\n\n \n\n \n Annie shifts her weight, her fingers drumming against her desk as she tries to recapture her typical breezy tone. \"Anyway, what were we talking about?\"\n\n Annie shifts her weight, her fingers drumming against the counter as she tries to recapture her typical breezy tone. \"Anyway, what were we talking about?\"\n\n \n\n She giggles, light and airy, but there’s a faint flush to her cheeks, and she glances away, her hands fussing with her hair.\n\n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Annie has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “Hey Annie,” you say to her gently. “We should talk.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes look up, her face wiped of her smile. “I don’t want to,” she says weakly.\n\n \n\n “It’s okay,” you say, choosing your words carefully. “I haven’t told anyone what I saw.”\n\n \n\n She studies you for a moment, then lets out a small sigh. “Thank you.”\n\n \n\n You give her a sympathetic smile. She seems to relax just a little, as a pout creeps in. Her eyes flicker around the reception area, then she looks directly up at you.\n\n \n\n “It’s not that I want to,” she mutters. “It’s just part of the job.”\n\n \n\n “He forces you to do that?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She shakes her head. “No. It’s just implied.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “But… it doesn’t sound right.”\n\n \n\n Annie grimaces, looking away. “I just need to. To get by. And compliance is an appealing quality.” She gives you a timid smile. “I don’t want to talk about it, . Is that alright?”\n\n \n\n You pause for a long moment, then nod. “Sure. Whatever you want, Annie.”\n\n \n\n She smiles, genuine and without subtext. “Thank you, . I appreciate you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n <>\n\n \n “Listen Annie,” you begin. “About the other night.”\n\n \n\n She looks around to see if anyone else is listening, before looking back at you.\n\n \n\n “I just wanted to say I’m sorry,” you tell her. “I shouldn’t have done that.”\n\n \n\n She looks, studying you for a long moment. Then she nods and sighs. “It’s alright. We both had a lot to drink.” She glances down at her computer, as if she’s embarrassed by mentioning it. \n\n \n\n \"It's a shame you're not a boy,\" she says, quietly. \n\n \n\n Annie looks up at you, meeting your eye. A moment passes between you. “I’ll be at McTafey’s pub again this evening. If you wanted a drink. As friends. Or if you ever want to come around for a chat, I'm usually home on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Despite what some people in town say.\"\n\n \n\n You give her a noncommittal smile. It’s enough for her to gain one of her own back. \n \n \n “Listen Annie,” you begin. “About the other night.”\n\n \n\n She looks around to see if anyone else is listening, before looking back at you.\n\n \n\n “I just wanted to say I’m sorry,” you tell her. “I shouldn’t have walked out like that.”\n\n \n\n She looks, studying you for a long moment. Then she nods and sighs. “It’s alright. I mean, I know you have a girlfriend.” She glances down at her computer, as if she’s embarrassed by mentioning it. \n\n \n\n “I was just disappointed you left,” she says, quietly. \n\n \n\n Annie looks up at you. “Hey , I’ll be at McTafey’s pub again this evening. If you wanted to drop by.”\n\n \n\n You give her a noncommittal smile. It’s enough for her to gain one of her own back. \n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n “Sure, that sounds great,” you tell Annie.\n\n \n\n She grins and stands up, bouncing over to a hook on the wall next to Thompson's office, her long legs clip-clopping over the floor in her pumps.\n\n \n\n She wraps her long trench coat around her body and smiles at you, gesturing to the front door. \"Shall we?\"\n \n \n “Sure, that sounds great,” you tell Annie.\n\n \n\n Her mouth turns into a grin and she leaps up, bouncing over to a hook on the wall next to Thompson's office, her long legs clip-clopping over the floor in her pumps.\n\n \n\n She wraps her long trench coat around her body and extends her arm for you to take it. “Shall we?”\n \n \n \n \n “Sure, that sounds great,” you tell Annie.\n\n \n\n She grins and stands up, bouncing over to the hat stand, her long legs clip-clopping over the floor in her pumps.\n\n \n\n She wraps her long trench coat around her body and smiles at you, gesturing to the front door. \"Shall we?\"\n \n \n “Sure, that sounds great,” you tell Annie.\n\n \n\n Her mouth turns into a grin and she leaps up, bouncing over to the hat stand, her long legs clip-clopping over the floor in her pumps.\n\n \n\n She wraps her long trench coat around her body and extends her arm for you to take it. “Shall we?”\n \n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n \n “I’m sorry, I have other plans,” you tell Annie.\n\n \n\n She raises an eyebrow. \"Don't tell me you're going out for lunch with Dan?\"\n\n \n\n \"No!\" you snap back. Annie giggles.\n\n \n\n \"I wouldn't judge. Free lunch is a free lunch. But if you change your mind about a girl's trip one day, let me know.\"\n\n \n\n Annie offers you a warm smile, then grabs her coat and walks out of the office.\n\n \n “I’m sorry, I have other plans,” you tell Annie.\n\n \n\n She pouts. “You could always cancel them. For me?”\n\n \n\n You grimace and shake your head. She looks at you for a moment, then sighs. “If you change your mind later on in the week, I'll be waiting.”\n\n \n\n \n Annie flashes a grin as she takes down her coat from a hook on the wall near Thompson's office and walks out into reception.\n\n Annie flashes a grin as she picks up her coat from the stand and walks out in the high street.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <> \n <>\n\n \n “Hey Annie, I was wondering if you wanted to grab lunch at the Charlton, after all?”\n\n \n\n Annie’s grins. “Dan blow you out, ?” she replies. \"Don't worry. I'll be your wing woman.\" She jumps to her feet and walks around the desk, grabbing her trenchcoat. “Let's drown the rejection with a glass of wine.” She winks at you.\n\n \n “Hey Annie, I was wondering if you wanted to grab lunch at the Charlton, after all?”\n\n \n\n Annie’s face brightens. “I’d love to, ,” she replies. She jumps to her feet and rushes around the desk, grabbing her trenchcoat and extending her arm for you to link yours to. “Lead the way. Your treat, right?” She winks at you.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n \n “You went to Charlton Upper School, didn’t you, Annie?\", you ask the receptionist. \n\n \n\n “Yes, I graduated two years ago,” she tells you. “It seems so long ago.”\n\n \n\n “How did you find it?”\n\n \n\n “It was fun,” she says, but with uncertainty in her voice. “Hard though. I’m not made for reading. Beauty is our greatest asset, after all.”\n\n \n\n You shrug, noncommitally. She giggles and smiles. \"Also,\" she continues. \"I wasn’t that popular. The teachers were friendly, though. Some, like the PE teacher Mr. Beach, were very friendly. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n \n\n You give her a look. From the way she's smiling, you can't tell if there's regret or enthusiasm for what you can assume she's alluding to.\n\n \n\n You notice she shifts a little and pulls at the hem of her skirt. Then her focus shifts back to you and she seems full of confidence again. “How about you, ? I could see you being a teacher. You seem smart.”\n\n \n\n “I don’t think I’m cut out for teaching,” you politely respond to Annie.\n\n \n\n “I don’t know about that,” she says earnestly. \"I think some of the girls at Charlton could do with a role model like you.”\n\n \n \"You went to Charlton Upper School, didn't you, Annie?\", you ask the receptionist. \n\n \n\n “Yes, I graduated two years ago,” she tells you. “The same year as Jennifer. It seems so long ago.”\n\n \n\n “How did you find it?”\n\n \n\n “It was fun,” she says, but with uncertainty in her voice. “Hard though. I’m not made for reading. Beauty is my greatest asset, don’t you think?”\n\n \n\n She titters when you don’t reply and smiles. “Also, I wasn’t that popular. But the teachers were friendly. Mr. Beach especially. Me and him saw eye to eye.”\n\n \n\n You notice she shifts a little in her chair and pulls at the hem of her skirt. Then her focus shifts back to you and she seems full of confidence again. “How about you, ? I could see you being a teacher. I would have liked to be in your class.” \n\n \n\n “I don’t think I’m cut out for teaching,” you politely respond to Annie.\n\n \n\n “I don’t know about that,” she purrs. “I bet you could teach me a thing or two, .”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"How's work looking today?\" you ask her.\n\n \n\n \n \n “Never took you as a girl boss.” Annie says, grinning. “From the way Mr. Thompson talks, you’ll be in charge soon. That booking system you’ve been working on is paying off. Mr. Thompson keeps saying, ‘More efficient, more effective.’ I don't think I've ever met a woman like you, ? Maybe there's hope for us all.\"\n \n \n “Maybe I should start calling you sir?” Annie says, winking. “From the way Mr. Thompson talks, you’ll be my next boss. That booking system you’ve been working on is paying off. Mr. Thompson keeps saying, ‘More efficient, more effective.’ How are you doing it, ? Working nights? You should let me know when you’re staying late. I’ll keep you company.”\n\n \n \n \n Annie smiles politely. “There’s some minor bugs in the booking program. It seems to be working okay. Enough that Mr. Thompson has stopped complaining about it. That means no one is complaining to him. You’re doing a good job, . Keep it up and maybe you’ll get a raise. Maybe we should go to the Salon to treat ourselves, if you do!”\n \n \n Annie smiles politely. “There’s some minor bugs in the booking program. It seems to be working okay. Enough that Mr. Thompson has stopped complaining about it. That means no one is complaining to him. You’re doing a good job, . Keep it up and maybe you’ll get a raise. We can go out to dinner to celebrate, if you like.”\n\n \n \n \n “There’s still some troubles with the booking system,” Annie tells you. “Mr. Thompson isn’t exactly pleased with it. I understand you’ve got your sister to take care of. Just be careful, okay ? Mr. Thompson has already started talking about how he shouldn't have trusted a woman to do a man's job. He keeps remarking about how he shouldn't pay you sick leave for woman's issues.”\n \n \n “There’s still some troubles with the booking system,” Annie tells you. “Mr. Thompson isn’t exactly pleased with it. I understand you’ve got your sister to take care of. Just be careful, okay ? Mr. Thompson has asked to see records of how much time you’re taking off.”\n\n \n \n \n “You need to fix that booking system,” she says, her voice whispered and unusually serious. “Mr. Thompson is on the war path for you. You’re lucky there’s no one else that can do this job in Charlton, but he's telling people he's going to make you stay late. You don't want to stay late with him, . Trust me.”\n \n \n “You need to fix that booking system,” she says, her voice whispered and unusually serious. “Mr. Thompson is on the war path for you, . You’ve been skipping too many days and phoning in sick. You’re lucky there’s no one else that can do this job in Charlton, but don’t push it.”\n\n \n \n \n “, I’m telling you this as a friend,” Annie says, her smile fading. “You need to start turning up to work. Thompson has started calling around to try and find someone else who can do your job. If you don’t do something different soon, he’s going to fire you. And you don't want to be unemployed in Charlton. The jobs available are not ones you'll want to do.”\n \n \n “, I’m telling you this as a friend,” Annie says, her smile fading. “You need to start turning up to work. Thompson has started calling around to try and find someone else who can do your job. If you don’t do something different soon, he’s going to fire you. And there’s not that many jobs for a computer geek in Charlton.”\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n “Can you tell me a bit more about your time at Charlton?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “You seem awfully interested in that school, ,” Annie tells you. “What's with the questions?”\n\n \n\n “I’m curious,” you reply. “My sister is struggling. Just wondered if that was normal.”\n\n \n\n Annie frowns slightly, her smile faltering just a fraction. “That’s sad. Does she have many friends?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “It’s been tough. Moving to a new place.”\n\n \n\n She looks sympathetic. “It can be hard. I wasn’t that popular. I only had one friend, and she moved away for the last year. You should tell her to make friends with the teachers. If the other students are being mean, they'll look out for her. Coach Beach especially.”\n\n \n\n You think about your experiences with the teachers. Especially Coach Beach. You try not to let your mind drift on exactly how friendly Annie was with them.\n\n \n\n “If you like, you could tell her to come see me one day after school,” Annie says. “We could do a girl’s shopping trip. That might cheer her up.”\n\n \n\n You nod, unsure if you want to introduce your sister to Annie. \n \n \n “Can you tell me a bit more about your time at Charlton?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “You seem awfully interested in what I was like as a school girl, ,” Annie tells you. “Is this some sort of uniform fetish?”\n\n \n\n A smile creeps over your face. *If only she knew what you’d been through.*\n\n \n\n “I’m curious,” you reply. “My sister is struggling. Just wondered if that was normal.”\n\n \n\n Annie frowns slightly, her smile faltering just a fraction. “That’s sad. Does she have many friends?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “It’s been tough. Moving to a new place.”\n\n \n\n She looks sympathetic. “It can be hard. I wasn’t that popular. Not like Jennifer. I only had one friend, and she moved away for the last year. You should tell her to make friends with the teachers. Even if the other students are picking on you, they will look out for her. Coach Beach especially.”\n\n \n\n You think about your experiences with the teachers. Especially Coach Beach. You try not to let your mind drift on exactly how friendly Annie was with them.\n\n \n\n “If you like, you could tell her to come see me one day after school,” Annie says. “We could do a girl’s shopping trip. That might cheer her up.”\n\n \n\n You nod, unsure if you want to introduce your sister to Annie. \n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n “Mr. Thompson seems angrier than usual recently,” you begin. “Is the company doing okay?”\n\n \n\n She titters before responding. “I haven’t noticed. He’s always been angry. You just need to know how to handle him.”\n\n \n\n You throw her a look and she scrunches up her nose in response. \"Oh come on, . Don't make me spell it out. Just indulge him a little.\"\n\n \n\n She looks off to the side momentarily, before turning back to you. \"You have to do what you have to do in Charlton,” she says, a little more quietly than usual. “Jobs for single women aren’t exactly easy to come by. And a good secretary follows orders.\"\n\n \n\n “Besides,” she says, her smile returning. “There are some perks to working there. Tell me, are you a Clive or Gordon girl? Unless, Dan's oily charm does something for you?”\n\n \n\n You feel yourself blushing. She giggles.\n \n \n “Mr. Thompson seems angrier than usual recently,” you begin. “Is the company doing okay?”\n\n \n\n She titters before responding. “I haven’t noticed. He’s always been angry. You just need to know how to handle him.”\n\n \n\n Her smile fades at the expression you didn’t realise you’d made. “Anyway, you have to do what you have to do in Charlton,” she says. “Jobs for single women aren’t exactly easy to come by. And a good secretary follows orders.\"\n\n \n\n “Besides,” she says, her smile returning. “There’s some perks to working there. All the beefy tradies. And the guys in the office aren’t bad, too.” \n\n \n\n You blush as she winks at you.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n “How's work going?” you begin. “Everything going okay?”\n\n \n\n She smiles sympathetically. \"It's okay,\" she replies. \"Theodore's doing a good job, even though it's a pain getting updates to the software via a disk every week. Otherwise, same old, same old. Working reception.”\n\n \n\n \"So, no one's missing me?\"\n\n \n\n Annie smiles with tenderness and warmth. \"I miss you, . The office isn't the same without you. At least you balanced out some of the masculine energy.\"\n\n \n\n You offer her a smile of your own.\n\n \n\n \"But if you're asking do I think there's a chance you could get your job back?\" she adds, before grimacing. \"I think the answer would be no. Once Thompson's made up his mind about someone, it's hard to change it.\"\n \n\n You nod, the firm realisation striking you that returning to Thompson's repairs is just not an option.\n\n \n\n \"How's things going on that?\" Annie asks. \"Find anything?\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"We're getting by.\"\n\n \n\n Annie looks at you, then glances off towards the bar. \"Aren't we all?\" she mutters. \n\n \n “How's work going?” you begin. “Everything going okay?”\n\n \n\n She shrugs, trying to be nonchalant. \"It's okay,\" she replies. \"Theodore's doing a good job, even though it's a pain getting updates to the software via a disk every week. Otherwise, same old, same old. Working reception.”\n\n \n\n \"So, no one's missing me?\"\n\n \n\n Annie grins, leaning forward towards you. \"I can think of one person who misses having you around the office. They're so bored without you to keep them company.\"\n\n \n\n \"Tell Gordon he can come by anytime,\" you joke back. She giggles, smiling as she watches you.\n\n \n \n \"So nothing broken?\" you try again.\n\n \n\n \"If you're asking do I think there's a chance you could get your job back?\" she adds, before grimacing. \"I think the answer would be no.

She then notices you watching. “I had fun at gym!” she says. “My advice to her would be to smile at the coach, put the effort in, and you'll avoid having to clean up afterward.\" \n\n \n\n “Plus,” she adds, a sultry tone suddenly in her voice. “I bet she doesn’t mind it too much. All that testosterone, surrounded by boys. I bet she enjoys those lessons more than she lets on.”\n\n \n\n You frown and she laughs. “She’s what, eighteen now? She’s not a little girl anymore, . It wasn't so long ago since you were at school. Even in the city, you must have noticed boys in lessons?”\n \n \n “Emily mentioned that Coach Beach’s PE lessons are hard,” you say, thinking back to your own experience of them. “She finds the gym sessions grueling.”\n\n \n\n Annie’s focus seems to drift away a bit as a vacant smile comes to her face.

And sometimes it lasts a bit longer.”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n “You went to school with Jennifer Chambers, didn't you?\"\n\n \n\n Annie bristles at the mention of the name. \"Yes,\" she says flatly.\n\n \n\n \"What was she like at school?\"\n\n \n\n Annie gives you a look. \"Popular. A cheerleader. We didn't move in the same circles. I actually knew how to let my hair down.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, considering her words. “Did you two not see eye-to-eye?”\n\n \n\n “You could say that,\" Annie curtly replies. \"Look, I know the two of you are friends. Just... leave me out of any plans with her. If you can.\"\n \n \n\n Annie delivers the last sentence almost as a plea. You decide not to press the subject.\n\n \n “What was Jennifer like at school?” you ask her, trying to reinforce the existence of your girlfriend to her.\n\n \n\n Annie smiles coyly. “She was one of the popular kids. She’s pretty, . She was very popular.”\n\n \n\n She laughs when you grimace. “Don’t worry, . She was a tease. I don’t even remember her even going on a date. Until you.”\n\n \n\n “Did you two not see eye-to-eye?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “I wasn’t in her circles,” she replies flatly. “She was a cheerleader. Top of her class. I spent my school days having a little fun. Still do, if you’d like to try it one time.”\n\n \n\n She giggles as your cheeks redden, but says nothing.\n\n \n <>\n <>\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n “I was meaning to ask you, why does Mr. Thompson always keep his office locked?”\n\n \n\n Annie's eyebrow rises. “Why do you want to know about that?” she asks, a grin spreading across her face.\n\n \n\n “It seems odd,” you reply. “It’s just a repair business. It’s not like there would be anything of value in there.”\n\n \n\n “You’d be surprised,” Annie tells you. “People in Charlton are pretty trusting. A lot of the town’s businesses keep spare keys in his office just in case there’s an emergency with a burst pipe or faulty electricals. Mr. Thompson is very particular who he trusts with access to that.”\n\n \n\n “I bet you have a key, though?”\n\n \n\n Surprisingly to you, Annie frowns. “I don’t work late nights with him, if that’s what you mean, .” \n\n \n\n She seems to have taken offence at your phrasing, but after a long moment lets it go. “But I do have a key for his office. I wouldn't advise trying to get in there, though. He drops in and out the office most evenings. Even on Saturday and Sunday nights. Hard to know when he'll be here. And you don't want to be on the bad side of Mr. Thompson. Especially if you're a woman.”\n\n \n\n You nod. Annie smiles politely, diffusing the tension.\n \n \n “I was meaning to ask you, why does Mr. Thompson always keep his office locked?”\n\n \n\n Annie’s eyebrows raise upward. “Why do you want to know about that?” she asks, a grin spreading across her face.\n\n \n\n “It seems odd,” you reply. “It’s just a repair business.

She grins. \n\n \n\n “Do you know McTafeys?”, she asks you. “It’s on Avian Lane. Irish pub. Can get a bit rowdy sometimes. Don’t worry though, . We'll make it fun.”\n\n \n\n You know where Avian Lane is. Jennifer’s apartment is opposite. You idly wonder about inviting her too, but you know she and Annie don't see eye to eye.\n\n \n\n \n \n “I’ll see you there,” Annie says, standing up and putting her coat on. “I should get back. But looking forward to a proper night out.

You won't be disappointed, .”\n\n \n\n \n With that, she stands and puts her coat on. “I should get back,” she tells you.\n \n With that, she stands and puts her coat on. “We should get back,” she tells you.\n \n \n \n “I don’t think so, Annie,” you tell her gently. “Maybe some other time.”\n\n \n\n She eyes you intently, but shrugs. “Sure,” she says, without emotion. “Let me know if you change your mind though.” She gives you a grin. “I’m sure you won’t regret buying me a drink, .”\n\n \n\n \n With that, she stands and puts her coat on. “I should get back,” she tells you.\n \n With that, she stands and puts her coat on. “We should get back,” she tells you.\n \n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n\n “I wanted to talk to you about school,” you say to her.\n\n \n\n Annie looks up at you, rigid and motionless. “What about it?”\n\n \n\n You moisten your lips nervously, tasting Jennifer’s lipstick. “We didn’t get along, did we?” \n\n \n\n This does cause a reaction. Astonishment and anger spreads across Annie’s face. “We? You made my life hell for three years. I don’t think there was anything *we* about it.”\n\n \n\n You tilt your head, digesting her words. “I made your life hell?” you ask quietly.\n\n \n\n She laughs derisively. “What do you want, Jennifer? Finally developing a conscience now the rosy days of school are over? Well I'm not interested in your apologies. You made mine and Penny’s life miserable. So now it’s my turn.”\n\n \n\n Annie’s trademark smile grows on her face. Suggestive, secret, but for the first time you feel malice mixed in there too.\n\n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n “Just waiting for a friend,” she says, noncommittally. “What are you doing here?

It's almost like you're serving out time, Jennifer. I wonder, what could you have done to make you feel so guilty?”\n\n \n\n “What do you mean?” you ask, quietly.\n\n \n\n Annie titters. “Burying your memories?” she asks. “Or are you still pretending that you didn’t start those rumours about me and Penny being more than friends?”\n\n \n\n “What rumours?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She looks back at you, any semblance of serenity stripped from her face. “Just drop it, Jen. I don’t need to revisit the past.”\n\n \n\n Annie shifts in her seat, leaning forward. \"But you don't fool me, cheerleader. People will figure you out, soon enough.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at her, silent.\n\n \n “Just waiting for a friend,” she says, noncommittally. “What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at home baking and cooking and being a perfect housewife?”\n\n \n\n “I know how to have fun,” you murmur defensively. \n\n \n\n “Binge watching reruns?” Annie taunts you. “Spending every night indoors? must be loving middle-aged life coming early.”\n\n \n\n Annie crosses her legs, drawing attention to her miniskirt. “You should watch that boy, Jennifer. Otherwise, you might find yourself at the centre of some rumours this time directed at you.”\n\n \n\n “What do you mean?” you ask, quietly.\n\n \n\n Annie titters. “Burying your memories?” she asks. “Or are you still pretending that you didn’t start those white-lies about Penny and I about being more than friends?”\n\n \n\n “What?”\n\n \n\n She looks back at you, any semblance of serenity stripped from her face. “Just drop it, Jen.

But Mr. Thompson's personal acquaintances... they're more demanding than I expected. And the man can't pick up dry cleaning without help. I feel sorry for his wife.\"\n\n \n\n “What does he ask you to do?” you pry, interested.\n\n \n\n \n At that, Annie grins. “Nothing that I don’t want to do,” she says with a coy smile. “He’s been more respectful recently. Almost like a cuddly tiger. Still flashes his teeth at everyone else, though.”\n\n Annie gives you a knowing look. “He’s got some traditional ideas about what the duties of a Personal Assistant are. I’m sure you can imagine what a middle-aged man thinks he’s going to get bumping your pay and having your outside his office. Keeping him in check. It takes a lot.”\n\n \n\n Annie sniggers, mostly to herself. “Honestly, the hardest part is being in the same room as Dan. The man doesn’t keep his eyes to himself for a minute.” A flash of realisation passes her face, glancing over at your old desk. \"I'm sure you know better than most.\"\n\n \n\nThere's a tension in the air that wasn’t there before, as Annie blushes at inferring to your old position. She smiles sweetly. “Sometimes, a secretary has it a bit easier. Just try to remember that.”\n\n \n “How's the new role going?\" you ask her. “It's a big change.”\n\n \n\n She smiles, a little forced. “It's different, but not without its charm. I like being around people. Even if it is Dan. And Mr. Thompson’s personal acquaintances are different to our usual customers. They expect a bit more than a smile. But it’s a step up, with added perks.\"\n\n \n\n \"What do they expect from you?\" you pry, interested.\n\n \n\n \n \n At that, Annie giggles. “You sound like your idea of a PA is as archaic as Mr. Thompsons. For a big city boy, , you certainly share the same thoughts as some of the men in Charlton.”\n\n \n\n She laughs again as she sees you blush. “I assure you, that Thompson doesn’t always get what Thompson wants. But if you’re lucky, maybe I’ll indulge some of your naughty thoughts one day with you.”\n\n \n Annie gives you a look of slight anger with sadness. “That imagination of yours running overtime thinking of what I’m doing behind closed doors, ? A personal assistant is a professional job. You might want to lay off the dirty magazines for a bit.”\n\n \n\n You find yourself going to apologise, but Annie sighs and lets out her frustration with it. “It’s okay, I get it. Let’s just leave it, okay?”\n\n \n \n\n “The real challenge is Dan. He doesn’t shut up for a moment during the day. How did you ever get anything done working opposite him?”\n\n \n\n A flash of realisation passes her face, glancing over at your old desk. “I guess… well, it must have been hard to work with him around. I get that now.”\n\n \n\n There’s a tension in the air that wasn’t there before, as Annie blushes at inferring to your old position. She smiles sweetly. “I’m sure it will work out in the end, ”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You recall the note you found in Jen's locker. “I found a number scrawled in Jen’s old biology exercise book. It’s the landline for a kid called Terrence Handle. Does that name mean anything to you?”\n\n \n\n Annie’s brow furrows. “Terrence Handle? No… What’s this about, ”\n\n \n\n You deflect, pressing further. “I’m not sure. He goes to Charlton. Bookish, gets picked on, always seems nervous.”\n\n \n\n She shrugs slightly. “Maybe I would have seen him at Fresh Pot,” she replies. “There’s a few of those types that hang around there at weekends.” She casts her eyes up. “They have the gall to give me winks. Silly boys.”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “I don’t think so. Terrence barely speaks to girls.”\n\n \n\n Annie’s eyes flash with recognition for a heartbeat, but then blinks it away. “No… sorry. I don’t know him.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You remember the faded photograph from Jen's locker. \"I found a picture of you and Jennifer. You were just kids.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes narrow, then she sighs. \"Where did you see that?\"\n\n \n\n You quickly come up with a lie. \"It was in an old biology exercise book I was flicking through. If it wasn't for the hair colour, I don't think I would have recognised you.\"\n\n \n\n She looks at you carefully, then nods. \"I know the photo. Me and Jen when we were… what, nine? Just after I got rid of my ridiculous bowl cut. I didn't think Jen would still have it.”\n\n \n\n “You and Jen were close?” you ask. \n\n \n\n A sad smile appears on Annie’s face. She nods. “We lived on the same street. Spent every summer pretending we were the Charlton Explorers, planning our grand escape into the woods.”\n\n \n\n You watch her face soften for a moment. “You were friends?”\n\n \n\n Annie exhales and tucks a loose curl behind her ear. “She was my best friend. Then school happened. She changed. I changed. People… said stuff. And then we weren’t friends anymore.”\n\n \n\n You hesitate, letting the words sink in. “Any idea why she would have kept it in a school exercise book?”\n\n \n\n Annie frowns, genuine confusion clouding her features. “No. Jen was never good at biology. Even when we were kids.” She snorts. “Of course, she ended up top of the class at Charlton. But that’s what you get for being a headmaster’s favourite.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n “This is going to sound odd,” you say. “So just bear with me.”\n\n \n\n Annie takes a seat on her sofa, bouncing her leg on her knee. “I’m all ears,” she says, coyly. “Sounds scandalous.”\n\n \n\n You sit down next to her, looking at her with intent. “Jennifer’s tutoring a boy from school,” you say. “Terrence Handle. She’s giving him extra biology lessons.”\n\n \n\n Annie frowns, a smile forming. “Are you worried that Jen is doing the naughty with a teenager, ?”\n\n Annie laughs. “I’m not sure what that’s got to do with me, . What Jennifer Chambers gets up to in her own time I've long since not cared about.\"\n\n \n\n “It’s to prevent something terrible happening to him at school,” you say slowly. Then, with a pause. “Something that I think happened to you.”\n\n \n\n Annie’s blue eyes narrow, as she seemingly forces her smile to remain. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n \n A deep breath. “I don’t think Terrence likes girls,” you say. “I think he’s gay.”\n\n \n\n Her smile wilts, like a leaf in autumn. “I don’t understand.”\n\n \n\n And suddenly, colour drains from Annie’s face and she slumps over. \n\n \n\n You spring to catch her, a moment too late. Her head hits the soft couch, bouncing with a gentle thud. You shake her lightly, whispering her name. She begins to murmur, life returning back into her body. Her eyes look up at you.\n\n \n\n “Penny?” \n\n \n\n You hold her by the shoulders as she comes to. She looks at you again, her eyes appraising you with confusion. The dazzling blue eyes are faded. Almost lost in a fog. “I’m okay,” she mutters, despite how she looks.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You meet Annie’s gaze and ask softly, “What can you remember about Jennifer back in school?”\n\n \n\n Annie’s lips tighten, eyes drifting. “She… she used to bully me and Penny. Pick on us for being different. For not being part of their cheerleader crowd.”\n\n \n\n You lean in. “Do you remember how it started?”\n\n \n\n Annie exhales, pressing her fingertips to her temples. “The others started it. The cheerleaders, I mean. It was everywhere. In classrooms, halls. Jen was always with them. Then she started to join in. Tease our clothes, our hair.” She looks back at you. “It was a lot.”\n\n \n\n You wait, voice gentle. “Did that bullying lead to anything more?”\n\n \n\n Her brow furrows as if digging through a fog. “For a while,” she says, as if remembering. “Yes. It stopped. They… they were kind for a bit. I can’t remember why. But then Penny went away, and everything turned again.”\n\n \n\n Her look suddenly becomes distant again. For a moment, you can see magical energy swirling around her head. When she focuses back on you, she looks shocked. “What is happening to me, ?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n\n You settle back on the sofa and ask gently, “What do you remember about biology?”\n\n \n\n Annie’s cheeks flush slightly, but she masks it with a smile. “They taught us about the birds and the bees.” She looks at you for a reaction. “Sexual reproduction, . I don’t think that changes from school to school, even in the big city.\"\n\n \n\n You give her an appreciative smile. “What did you think of it?”\n\n \n\n Her smile rises. “Great,” she says, with no hesitation in her voice. “Males and females pairing up in nature. To survive and thrive. It’s perfectly natural, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n Weighing up your words, you pause. “So that all made sense to you? Back then?”\n\n \n\n Her brow furrows thoughtfully. “Why wouldn’t it?” She pauses, voice lowering as if recalling a half-forgotten whisper. “After all, girls are made for…”\n\n \n\n She trails off, jaw tightening. Annie blinks, as though shaken from a reverie. “I’m not sure why this feels… weird,” she admits, looking away.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n\n You lean forward and ask, “What do you remember about Penny back in school?”\n\n \n\n Annie’s face softens, a flicker of warmth in her eyes. “Penny… she got targeted by the cheerleaders just like me. But she was different. Assertive, always sticking up for herself. And for anyone they picked on. She even stuck up for me.”\n\n \n\n You offer a gentle smile. “Sounds like she was a good friend.”\n\n \n\n “She was,” Annie agrees, voice quiet.\n\n \n\n You wait, pressing on, “How close were you two?”\n\n \n\n Annie’s eyes flash with irritation. “Just friends,” she snaps, a tremor undercutting her words. She takes a breath, then blurts, “I know what you’re trying to insinuate, . But it wasn’t like that.” Her voice raises, almost into a shriek. “I like boys!”\n\n \n\n Her voice is almost cracking. Yet the doubt in her eyes says she isn’t entirely convinced.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n Annie’s shoulders slump against the sofa cushions, exhaustion etching her features. She presses a shaky hand to her forehead and blinks at you with unfocused eyes. “I’m sorry,” she whispers, voice hollow, “I don’t know what you’re trying to get from me.” She turns away, pulling the throw over her lap as if to hide. “I need some time. Please… just leave me be.”\n\n \n\n You rise slowly, your heart heavy. With one last look at the fading spark in her eyes, you rise and step toward the door, pausing only to give her a gentle nod before slipping away into the gathering dusk.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n “First of all,” you begin. “Why did you come over this morning?”\n\n \n\n She hesitates, considering. Then reaches into her pocket and pulls something small out, holding it up for you to see. An acorn. Plain. Ordinary. But you feel it pulsing with latent energy.\n\n \n\n “It arrived this morning” she says, meekly. “It feels important. Like it told me to bring it here.” She takes a deep breath. “It’s magic, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n You look at the acorn in Annie's hand. You feel its power radiating. “Yes,” you say. “It’s very powerful.”\n\n \n\n “It stopped you from doing… whatever you were going to do to me,” Annie comments. “I felt it. What was that, ? Were you using magic on me?”\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath. “It was a sleep spell. Thought it would be easier than having to go through all this with you.” You gesture to your face. “At least, not like this.”\n\n \n\n She glances up at your face. Her face. Her eyes seem sad. “This isn’t the first time, is it?”\n\n \n\n You purse your lips. Unable to reply. She looks away, crestfallen. And then reaches into her bag at her side, pulling out a piece of paper. Without looking at you, she holds it out. “It came with this.”\n\n \n\n You reach forward slowly to pick it up. It’s a scrap of paper with scrawled words in black ink:\n\n \n\n Go see them. They know. You’re ready now. – S.\n\n \n\n You glance at the initial. 'S'. Faint laughter echoes through your brain. Siobhan.\n\n \n\n “Somehow,” you hear Annie say. “I knew it meant you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I know what happened between you and Jennifer,” you begin. “At her locker. How Penny picked on Jen. You didn’t intervene.”\n\n \n\n “How does this help that boy?” Annie says, looking directly at you, her eyes cooling.\n\n \n\n “I just want to understand what happened to you,” you reply. “I think it’s a part of it.”\n\n \n\n Annie sighs. “Penny thought that Jen had sold out. She got good grades. Did well at school. No one did that without sucking up to Stitch.”\n\n \n\n You weigh up her words for a second. “Did she deserve to be bullied?” \n\n \n\n Her eyes drift again, thinking. “I suppose not. I guess I didn’t think of it that way.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"When Jen got into the cheerleader team, you told her she was just a barbie doll. Almost like you wanted to take her success away from her.”\n\n \n\n “How do you know that?” Annie snaps back. You raise an eyebrow slightly. It takes her a second to understand. “Magic,” she mutters.\n\n \n\n You let the silence bubble for a while. \"Were you jealous of her?\"\n\n \n\n Annie looks to you as if she’s going to say something. But lets it slip away. Instead, she shakes her head. “I guess I was angry. That she and I were no longer friends. And betrayed. She joined the squad that made my life hell.”\n\n \n\n “Did you ever try to reconcile things with her?”\n\n \n\n A small hiss comes out of Annie’s mouth. “What has this got to do with this kid in trouble, ?”\n\n \n\n Sensing her rising anger, you let this matter be.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “Do you remember being at lunchtime in the Maths class?” you ask. “With Penny.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes widen. “How do you…” she drifts off, knowing the answer. “That’s private.”\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry,” you say, a twinge of guilt at unwittingly stumbling across a tender moment. “But it did happen, right?”\n\n \n\n She nods. “I remember the way she touched my hand. The flutter. Her warm smile. The way she brushed a stray hair from my face. But I thought…” She peters off. “I have a vague memory of it being a boy. But it’s faint. Like it was just a dream.”\n\n \n\n You nod, letting this sink in, before answering another question. “What was she to you?” \n\n \n\n Annie looks back at you, but doesn’t say anything.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “What happened in Fresh Pot?” you ask. “When Penny saw you.”\n\n \n\n Even this vagueness is enough for her eyes to tear up. She knows exactly what you’re referring to. “Penny saw me,” she says. “With a boy. She stormed out, and when he asked who she was, I said she was just a friend.”\n\n \n\n You breathe quietly, letting Annie roll her restored memory around. “But I felt guilty for saying that. I felt like I never was going to forget the look she gave me when she saw me there with him.”\n\n \n\n She sniffs, wiping her eyes. “But I did forget. Didn’t I? How did I forget that…” She gives you a look. “It was magic, wasn’t it?”\n\n \n\n You give her a warm smile. “You remember now. That’s the most important thing.”\n\n \n\n She looks at you, then nods. And stares back at the floor again.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You take a deep breath. “This one might be painful,” you say. “Are you okay?”\n\n \n\n \"They're all painful, ,” Annie says meekly. \n\n \n\n “Do you remember a night in the school gym?” you continue. “With the cheerleader squad.”\n\n \n\n There is pain evident on her face as she listens to what you said. “I don't know,” she says quickly. “I think so. I was really out of it. I think… Penny had just left. I must have taken something. But I - I didn’t even drink, back then.”\n\n \n\n The confusion spreads across Annie’s face, struggling to reconcile shattered memories into a coherent whole. You give her a warm smile. She looks at your face and winces. Because it’s her own face trying to be sympathetic, isn’t it?\n\n \n\n “There was chanting,” she continues. “Loud voices. Skye told me that I was safe. But it didn’t feel safe. It felt…” She gives you a look as she takes a deep breath. “It felt like magic.”\n\n \n\n “Anything else?” you try.\n\n \n\n She gulps. “Christina’s face. Leaning in.” She scrunches her face up as the memory plays out in her mind. “She kissed me. And all I could think about was boys.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “That’s all I’ve got,” you tell her. “Thanks Annie.”\n\n \n\n Annie nods and turns to stare at the floor. You sit there in silence for long moments, both not wanting to speak.\n\n \n\n \n “Did they really… change me?” Annie says after some time. She looks up to meet your eyes. For the first time, she doesn’t seem to flinch away from looking at you in her form.\n\n \n\n Solemnly, you nod. “Yes. I’m sorry, Annie.”\n\n \n\n Just for a moment, the faintest of smiles spreads on her face. “Thank you,” she whispers. But the smile fades. “I don’t know what to do now.”\n\n \n\n “One day at a time,” you say. She gently nods.\n \n \n “Anything else come to mind?” you finally say.\n\n \n\n Annie looks up at you and shakes her head. “I’m sorry, . It’s all a jumble. I don’t know what to think anymore.”\n\n \n\n “And what about Penny?” you ask.\n\n \n\n At this, Annie looks at you. Her eyes sad. “We were just good friends, . After all, girls are made for --”\n\n \n\n You beat her to it. “Boys.”\n\n \n \n\n Annie takes a deep breath, looking around your room. “Did that help at all?” she mutters. “With helping this boy?”\n\n \n\n “I’m not sure,” you tell her. “But there’s a few clues in there.”\n\n \n\n Annie looks away, thinking. “My mind keeps returning to that gym. At school.” She turns to face you and for a moment she resembles something of the person you know. “That place gives me the chills. If whatever happened is happening again, it will probably be happening there.”\n\n \n\n You consider her words. Just like in the dream. “Is there anything else coming back to you?” you ask. “Anything at all?”\n\n \n\n She mulls over your words, then shrugs. “No. But you can find out. Why don’t you sneak in there before they get there? See what they do.”\n\n \n\n “They tend to keep the door locked,” you admit. \n\n \n\n \n “Well let’s open another one,” she says, a slight twang of buoyancy in her voice. “Tell you what, I’ll have a word with Coach Beach. I can get him to leave the emergency exit door ajar in the evening.”\n\n \n\n You give Annie a look. “Do you really want to be doing that, Annie?”\n\n \n\n She actually snorts. “I might now be going through an identity crisis, . But I’m not about to give up my skills on getting my own way.” She lowers her head, grinning as she looks at you from beneath her brows. “And those skills are more verbal than physical, if that’s what you were thinking.”\n \n \n\n Sighing, you nevertheless nod. “Just be careful.”\n\n \n\n She smiles back at you, only seeming a little forced. But something seems to strike her again. The flickers of cheerfulness once more gone.\n\n \n “There must be a way in there?” she asks. \"I could ask Coach Beach...\" she begins, but trails off. You can see on her face the conflict. As if she's second guessing her own thoughts.\n\n \n\n \"No,\" she mutters. \"I don't know what I feel about that.\"\n\n \n\n You can see the pain on her face. You don't press the issue further.\n\n \n \n\n Annie stands. She brushes down her skirt, flicking dust away.\n\n \n\n You glance up, covers still around your chest. “Are you leaving?”\n\n \n\n She looks back down at you, appraising you for a moment. “Yes,” she states. “In the grand scheme of things, this has been the strangest morning of my life. I don’t think I’ve even begun to process what you’ve told me, today. Or what you’ve done to me. Or,” her eyes look you over again. “What you’ve done as me.”\n\n \n\n “This isn’t okay, ,” she adds. “And we’re far from okay. But I want you to help that boy. Once he’s okay, come see me at my apartment one morning. Then, we’ll talk.”\n\n \n\n She steps forward towards the door and opens it. Then stops. She looks back. “I’ll keep up the act up at work if you will. Keep people off your back. Our little secret. Like the coffee.”\n\n \n\n You nod, giving her an appreciative smile. She just nods back, then walks out.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n “I remember it now,” she says. “Penny. And me. What happened at school.”\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath. “What do you remember?”\n\n \n\n Annie flicks her eyes up at you. “That I liked her. That we were more than friends. That…” she sighs, looking away again. “It was complicated.”\n\n \n\n “I’m so sorry, Annie,” you reply.\n\n \n\n There is a flicker of an appreciative smile. “It’s still confusing. It’s like I had one set of memories from school now, but they don’t work with how I’ve lived. I don’t know who I am. Do I like boys or girls? Am I bright and bubbly, or reserved and shy? It still doesn’t make sense.”\n\n \n\n “I do know one thing though,” she continues. “I want to know what happened to Penny. I think if I can find that out, it might become a bit clear.”\n\n \n\n “Are you going to search for her?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She looks to you, then nods. “But I think I need your help to do it.”\n\n \n\n “Of course,” you tell her. “What do you need?” Only then do you see her take a deep breath.\n\n \n\n \"I'm going to make a few trips. Up to where Penny went. Try and find her. Except,” she inhales. “I’m worried. If I suddenly go away. What this town will do to me. If I’m missing. Start missing work.”\n\n \n\n She hugs herself, as if trying to remain warm. “You had experience as being me. About acting like… well, how I’ve acted. Would you like to keep doing it?”\n\n \n\n You frown. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n\n “Just that…” she pauses, searching for the words. “Put it this way, if you were to come by one morning. You could spend the day as me. And I could be free to search for Penny. And no one would be any the wiser.” \n\n \n\n “What about me?” you ask. “And my life?”\n\n \n\n She winces. “It wouldn’t be permanent,” she tells you. “Just whenever you could. Take my shifts at work. Keep up the charade.”\n\n \n\n Annie looks at you, her eyes pleading. Spending days as Annie at the weekend was one thing. But working at Thompson’s Repairs, as her? And pretending nothing has changed? You shudder to imagine what she must go through at work.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"It's all so jumbled up,\" she says, sighing. \"I can't work out what's true and not anymore.\"\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath. “What do you remember?”\n\n \n\n Annie flicks her eyes up at you. “That's just it. I don't know. I know that Penny and I were friends. That it might have been a bit more. But I also remember feeling angry that my friend turned her back on me when I started dating. It's like I have two conflicting memories for parts of my life.\"\n\n \n\n You watch her release a tiny bit of frustration. “I’m so sorry, Annie.”\n\n \n\n There is a flicker of an appreciative smile. “I only know how I feel right now. That Penny was just a friend. And my life - the one I'm living - is who I am.\"\n\n \n\n \"What if it's not true?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n She looks at you, then shakes her head. \"Doesn't matter,\" she says, quietly. \"It feels right. Even if it's not. Besides, I've got more important things that I have to deal with right now.\"\n\n \n\n You frown. \"Like what?\"\n\n \n\n A bemused smile cracks across her face. \"Like my entire belief system being shattered. Like there's magic - actual magic - in the world and people in this town use it.\"\n\n \n\n \"And,\" she adds, pausing for effect. \"That you have been wandering around town... pretending to be me.\"\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath. \"Annie, I want to apologise -\"\n\n \n\n She cuts you off, quickly. \"Don't,\" she states. \"I don't think you can even begin to know what you're apologising for. I don't like it, . I don't like it at all. Even if you were just doing it to help that boy.\"\n\n \n\n You let her words hang for a few seconds. \"How can I make it up to you?\"\n\n \n\n Annie looks at you directly. \"Find another way to sort my head out. You seem deep in this stuff. If there's another way to find a way to unravel whatever was done to me, I want you to find it. I'll consider us even, then.\"\n\n \n\n You look at her, then nod. She offers a small smile in return.\n\n \n\n \"Okay, I better get ready,\" she says. \"I'll see you at work, . Don't worry about me. I've gotten good at hiding secrets.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes glance to the door. You take it as a signal of your next step. Rising, you begin to walk towards it.\n\n \n\n \"I've still got that acorn, \", you hear her say behind you. \"So don't try anything.\"\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n “Alright, Annie,” you tell her. “If that’s what you need.”\n\n \n\n She smiles with genuine gratitude and glee. “Oh thank you!” She reaches out and clutches your hand. “This means the world to me. Whenever you can spare a day, the door will always be open.”\n\n \n\n “How do you want me to act?” you ask. \n\n \n\n She glances at you. “Same as always. Same old Annie, living her life.” She smiles, thinly. “Except, you don’t have to do anything that would make you feel uncomfortable. I certainly won’t when it’s me. My eyes are open to what happens in this town now, . I might not be able to stop it, but I certainly don’t have to embrace it.”\n\n \n\n You nod, a little relief welling up inside you. \"Do you want me to go now?\"\n\n \n\n \n Annie looks at you, pausing for a second. She takes a deep breath. “There is one thing,” she adds. “I’m not sure if I’m into boys, . Or if I ever was. I’ll still be me, but… I’d like to get through this. As friends.”\n\n \n\n She offers you an embarrassed smile. You can only nod. “I understand.”\n\n \n\n The smile turns genuine with relief. “Thank you.”\n\n \n Annie looks at you, pausing for a second. She takes a deep breath. “There is one thing,” she adds. “I’m not sure if I’m into boys, . Or if I ever was. I’ll still be me, but… maybe we could spend some time together? Away from private eyes.”\n\n \n\n She offers you an embarrassed smile. You can only nod. “Sure.”\n\n \n\n The smile turns genuine with relief. “Thank you.”\n \n \n \n\n \n \n She looks over at the clock, eyes widening. “I guess I should get ready,” she tells you. “Thanks again, . Come by during the week. Whenever you can spare the time.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n She looks over at the clock, eyes widening. “I guess I should get ready,” she tells you, before tilting her head. \"Unless... you want to start today?\"\n\n \n\n You glance at Annie. Her eyes look bright. Her expression full of hope. \"You want me to transform now?\"\n\n \n\n She shrugs. \"There's a bus due soon to the city. I could spend the day doing some research.\"\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath, pondering your next move.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n “I’m not sure I can do that,” you tell her. “It’s a lot to ask.”\n\n \n\n She smiles, but there’s clear disappointment on her face. “I understand,” she tells you. “If you change your mind at any time, the door will always be open.”\n\n \n\n A still quiet hangs in the air again. She looks away thinking.\n\n \n\n “What happens now?” you ask. “What will you do?”\n\n \n\n She glances at you. “I’ll go on pretending. Same old Annie, living her life.” She smiles, thinly. “Except, my eyes are open to what happens in this town now, . I might not be able to stop it, but I certainly don’t have to embrace it.”\n\n \n\n \n Annie takes a deep breath. “There is one thing,” she adds. “I’m not sure if I’m into boys, . Or if I ever was. I’ll still be me, but… I’d like to get through this. As friends.”\n\n \n\n She offers you an embarrassed smile.

Like I said, if you change your mind, come by any morning during the week. And I’ll let you know if I learn anything.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"I can't today,\" you tell her. \"I'm sorry. I have to sort out a few things today.\"\n\n \n\n She smiles, but there’s clear disappointment on her face. “I understand,” she tells you. “Whenever you can spare the time, my door will always be open.”\n\n \n\n A still quiet hangs in the air again. She looks away thinking. But then turns back, shrugging it off.\n\n \n\n “Thanks again, . And I’ll let you know if I learn anything.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"Oh yes,\" you purr, rolling off her and pulling your panties down.\n\n \n\n \n She grins as she creeps down your body, watching your reaction as her face nears your genitalia. You part your legs and you watch Annie's blonde locks fall over your thighs. She smiles coyly, then leans forward. You gasp as her lips touch your penis.\n\n \n\n \"Oh god,\" you purr, as she laps at your junk. You convulse and tug at your legs, bringing them up higher and higher, as the blonde bombshell puts her head between your thighs and sucks on your small pecker.\n\n \n\n \"Do you like it?\" she whispers, as her tongue rolls around your prick. You can only squeal a response, digging your toes into her sheets and letting your hands caress your breasts as her tongue licks your tiny dick like it was a clit.\n\n \n\n Annie eagerly works your penis, teeth glimmering as she looks up at you. She pushes your legs wide open with her hands, pushing her face against your groin, pulling at your prick gently with her teeth.\n\n \n\n \"Cum for me, ,\" she whispers, vigorously massaging it between her fingers. \"I want you to cum so hard.\"\n\n \n\n It's enough to send you over the edge. You feel your penis shoot its load, arching your back as you push it against Annie's mouth as you scream in ecstasy.\n\n \n\n You collapse back on to the bed, spent. Eyes opening only once you've regained your breath. Annie still lies at the bottom of the bed, a small trickle of cum on her lips. She wipes it away with a hand and giggles.\n\n \n\n \"Aren't you full of secrets, ?\" she purrs. \"I can't say I've ever done that before.\"\n\n \n\n You look down at her, feeling a flush of guilt for not speaking to Annie about it. Almost reading your mind, she whispers for you to shush. \"It's okay,\" she says. \"Behind closed doors. Your secret is safe with me.\"\n\n \n\n You can only smile. She exhales, content, still looking up at you. \"I guess we should clean up.\"\n\n \n\n She slides off you, then moves up the bed against your body. Running a fingernail over one of your nipples and nestling her head into your chin. \"Or maybe we could lie here a little longer, still.\"\n\n \n\n You wrap your arms around her and enjoy the moment, listening to her breathing as her chest rises and falls against yours. After minutes have passed, she finally speaks. \"We should get ready for bed. Or I'll fall asleep here like this.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n She grins as she creeps down your body, watching your reaction as her face nears your genitalia. You part your legs and you watch Annie's blonde locks fall over your thighs. She smiles coyly, then leans forward.

You can only squeal a response, digging your toes into her sheets and letting your hands caress your breasts as her tongue licks at you.\n\n \n\n Annie eagerly laps at your labia, teeth glimmering as she looks up at you. She pushes your legs wide open with her hands, pushing her face against your groin, her tongue pushing between your lips and brushing the entrance to your womb.\n\n \n\n \"Cum for me, ,\" she whispers, vigorously massaging it between her fingers. \"I want you to cum so hard.\"\n\n \n\n It's enough to send you over the edge. Your body arches and your hands grab on to the pillows, pushing your groin hard against Annie's head as you scream in ecstasy.\n\n \n\n You collapse back on to the bed. Eyes opening only once you've regained your breath. Annie still lies at the bottom of the bed, still between your legs, her lips moist. She wipes them with a hand and giggles.\n\n \n\n \"I didn't know I could still do that,\" she purrs. \"It's been a while.\"\n\n \n\n \"You wouldn't know,\" you stammer.\n\n \n\n She slides off you, then moves up the bed against your body. Running a fingernail over one of your nipples and nestling her head into your chin. \"Maybe we could lie here a little longer before cleaning up.\"\n\n \n\n You wrap your arms around her and enjoy the moment, listening to her breathing as her chest rises and falls against yours. After minutes have passed, she finally speaks. \"We should get ready for bed. Or I'll fall asleep here like this.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n You roll off Annie and on to the side. For a moment there is confusion on her face. Then realisation as you run a finger down her thigh.\n\n \n\n \"I've got another idea,\" you tell her. \"Why don't I... explore you.\"\n\n \n\n She looks back to you, hesitantly. Then nods. \"Okay,\" she whispers.\n\n \n\n You work your fingers across her nearest leg, running a nail up and down her inner thigh. She murmurs with pleasure and parts her legs for you to continue. You reach her lacy panties, easily pulling them to one side. Your eyes linger on her smooth pussy, legs parted to encourage you.\n\n \n\n \"Be gentle,\" she says.\n\n \n\n You nod with a smile and run a finger across her lips. She groans as you touch her, arching her back on the bed. You take two fingers and run them up and down across her labia, feeling her body shake as you touch her.\n\n \n\n \"Oh fuck,\" she moans, head craned back as her toes dig into her sheets.\n\n \n\n You feel her juices seep out, glistening on her lips. With a smile, you move a finger to the centre, then gently push it between her lips with a pop.\n\n \n\n Annie buckles against your finger, grinding against it with pleasure. You grin and begin to rotate your finger around inside her.\n\n \n\n Her fingers clutch at the bed clothes as she writhes against your touch. You feel the inside of her womb as you push deeper and deeper. Then slide a second digit inside. She cries with joy as her body buckles.\n\n \n\n \"Oh god, oh god,\" Annie mutters, pushing her body against you. \"There. There. There!\"\n\n \n\n She squeals as you feel her shudder. You push your fingers against her body, finding the sweet spot that brings her maximum pleasure. She convulses against you.\n\n \n\n And then collapses on the bed, panting.\n\n \n\n Long moments pass before Annie opens her eyes, looking over at you. She smiles, content. \"That was... something.\"\n\n \n\n You lean forward and draw her into a tender kiss. She responds enthusiastically, then rests her head against yours, staring into your eyes.\n\n \n\n You wrap your arms around her and enjoy the moment, listening to her breathing as her chest rises and falls against yours. After minutes have passed, she finally speaks. \"We should get ready for bed. Or I'll fall asleep here like this.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n **Annie's Apartment - Bathroom**\n\n [image: ./images/Annies_Apartment_Bathroom.png]\n\n You make your way back into the living room and through the door you assume is Annie's bathroom. Sure enough, the smells of perfume and products hit you as you walk into the room.\n\n \n\n You look at yourself in the mirror, smiling to yourself. Your reflection stares back at you. For once, you seem at peace.\n\n \n\n Cleaning up slightly, you make your way back to the bedroom. Annie is already under the covers, make-up removed, her hair pulled back in a ponytail. She’s wearing a pink satin long-sleeve pajama set. The top buttoned up at the front. The pants just visible where she’s pulled down the covers. \n\n \n\n You wordlessly slide in with her and she nestles her back against yours. \"Hold me,\" she asks.\n\n \n\n You wrap your arms around her and she snuggles against your chest. “Goodnight, ,” she whispers, before flicking the light off.\n \n \n\n It’s not long before you hear the gentle breathing of Annie fast asleep, content and peaceful in your arms.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "\"I was curious about who had my place on the squad before me,\" you begin. \"Tandi. At least, I think that was her name.\"\n\n \n\n Britney shares a look with Stacey before turning back to you. \"Who's been talking about Tandi?\"\n\n \n\n You shrug. \"Just heard the name mentioned a few times.\"\n\n \n\n \"Tandi was - is - someone you don't want to get caught up with,\" Britney tells you, for once losing her sparkle. \"She's toxic, Em. Got into all kinds of bad stuff.\"\n\n \n\n \"Or bad stuff gets into her,\" Stacey snipes. \"Regularly.\"\n\n \n\n Britney shushes the cheerleader, then smiles at you. \"She used to be on the squad. But Em -\" she hesitates, then lowers her voice. \"She's turned into a total slut!\"\n\n \n\n Stacey rolls her eyes at Britney's anxiety about talking this way. \"Stop it!\" Britney says to her friend. \"She has! Last I heard, she hangs out with those icky bikers outside of town.\"\n\n \n\n \"What happened to her?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n Again, Britney seems uncomfortable. \"Just didn't belong in the cheerleaders. But I'm sure that won't happen to you, Em. You belong with us!\"\n\n \n\n You notice Stacey giving another dark glance to her friend. It's enough to make Britney fall silent.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \"Curses?\" Britney’s eyes light up with excitement, and she leans in closer. \"Oh my gosh, they’re, like, so fascinating! Did you know you can use them to make people totally do what you want? Like, Reagan was being super bossy the other day, and I thought, Wouldn’t it be hilarious if she couldn’t stop hiccupping during practice?\" She giggles, the thought clearly delighting her.\n\n \n\n \"Of course, Reagan didn't let that go unanswered,\" Stacey follows up, causing Britney to pout. After glaring at her friend, she turns back to you.\n\n \n\n \"They’re kind of like this secret weapon, you know? A way to, like, set things right when people are being... difficult. And they’re fun to experiment with! You wouldn’t believe how many tiny changes can totally mess with someone’s day.\" She twirls a strand of her hair, her tone bright and carefree.\n\n \n\n Then, as if remembering herself, she shrugs. \"I mean, as long as you don’t, like, overdo it or anything. Some people get all serious about curses, but honestly? It’s just a little harmless fun. Right?\"\n\n \n\n Her grin falters for a moment, a flicker of doubt crossing her face, before she brushes it off with a breezy laugh. \"Anyway, if you’re dealing with one, let me know! I could totally help you figure out how to turn it into something... fun.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n When you mention Reagan, Britney’s cheerful demeanor dims slightly. \"Oh, Reagan? She’s... well, she’s Reagan.\" Britney forces a smile, but it doesn’t quite reach her eyes.\n\n \n\n \"I mean, she’s amazing. So confident, so sure of herself. I’ve always admired that about her. But, like...\" She hesitates, twirling her bracelet nervously. \"Sometimes she can be a little... pushy, you know? Like, she knows what’s best for everyone. I just wish she’d, um, let people figure stuff out for themselves sometimes.\"\n\n \n\n She glances at you, her smile returning, though it feels a little strained. \"But she really does mean well. I think.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \"Me?\" Britney blinks, her eyes widening as a faint blush creeps across her cheeks. \"Oh, um, that’s sweet of you to ask. I mean, I’m not exactly, like, the most interesting person around or anything.\" She fidgets with the bracelet on her wrist, glancing away for a moment before flashing a small, genuine smile. \"But, uh... thanks.\"\n\n \n\n She hesitates, clearly unsure where to start, before her face lights up. \"Oh! Well, I’ve been pretty busy lately. My brother - Marc, he runs our family farm - is getting married soon, so I’ve been helping plan the wedding. It’s kind of a big deal, you know? Catherine - his fiancée - just moved to Charlton a little while ago. She’s, like, amazing. So creative and thoughtful. She runs the new flower shop. Have you seen it?\"\n\n \n\n Britney leans in slightly, her voice dropping as though sharing a secret. \"It’s funny, actually. Catherine’s... different. She doesn’t really fit the Charlton mold, you know? Kind of like you.\" Her eyes meet yours, and she gives a soft laugh. \"I think that’s why I like her so much. She’s not afraid to do things her way, and it’s... refreshing.\"\n\n \n\n She straightens up, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. \"Anyway, the wedding’s going to be beautiful, but I’m kind of freaking out about planning the hen party. Catherine’s not really into all the traditional Charlton stuff, and I want her to actually enjoy it, you know? But Reagan and my mom keep giving me these ideas, and... ugh.\" She sighs, her bubbly tone faltering for a moment. \"It’s just a lot.\"\n\n \n\n Britney perks up again, her cheerful smile returning. \"But enough about me! What about you? What’s new?\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n “So,” you say, keeping it casual, “what’s going on with Terrence?”\n\n \n\n Britney immediately perks up, twirling a strand of hair. “Isn’t he adorable?” she says, bright as ever. “Like... in a weird, lost puppy kind of way.”\n\n \n\n Stacey rolls her eyes. “Christina’s just trying to help him. You know how she is.”\n\n \n\n You tilt your head. “Help him how?”\n\n \n\n Britney shrugs, too fast. “We’re just trying to bring a little joy into his life. He looked so lonely. Honestly, it was kind of sad.”\n\n \n\n Stacey rolls her eyes. “And it was working, too. Until -”\n\n \n\n Her words drop off when Britney catches her eye. You look between the two, sensing the awkwardness between them. “Come on,” you push. “We’re all friends here. What’s the plan?”\n\n \n\n “You should talk to Chrissie,” Britney says, almost serious. “She can tell you.”\n\n \n\n “I can help, though,” you try.\n\n \n\n “If you want to help,” Britney says, too quickly, “figure out what’s in that book.” \n\n \n\n Stacey nudges her with her elbow, giving her a dark look. You raise your eyebrow at them, waiting.\n\n \n\n “His biology book,” Stacey admits. “He was starting to warm up. But now his head is always in it. He clutches it like it’s his diary.”\n\n \n\n You narrow your eyes. “Isn’t that helping him?” \n\n \n\n “Not in the way Chrissie would like,” Britney mutters.\n\n \n\n “And how -” you begin, but Stacey cuts you off. \n\n \n\n “You need to trust Christina will tell you what you need to know when you need to know it,” she says, curtly. “If you really want to assist, find a way of seeing what’s in that book. Break into his locker or something.”\n\n \n\n You narrow your eyes. “Tell me what, though?”\n\n \n\n They say nothing.\n\n \n\n Stacey sips her drink. Britney studies the whipped cream on her spoon like it’s suddenly fascinating.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

I'm sure she'll appreciate the experience.\"\n\n \n\n Lydia’s smile broadens subtly, a gleam of approval flickering in her calculating eyes. \"Splendid decision. Thompson’s Repairs will provide her with precisely the experience she needs to excel after school. Mr. Thompson will be pleased.\"\n\n \n\n She scribbles something neatly onto a notepad before placing her pen carefully down. \"I'll inform Emily immediately.

While academic excellence is admirable, practical experience is also essential for our students here in Charlton. Real-world responsibilities shape character, after all.\"\n\n \n\n “I understand,” you reply. “But I want to give Emily the best opportunity to graduate with grades that reflect her abilities.”\n\n \n\n The career advisor gives you a polite smile, but you sense something underneath it.\n\n \n\n \n ”I commend you for your commitment to academic resilience,” she says. “In fact, perhaps we can help spur Emily on.

    "text": "“You seem like you’re not from around here,” you tell Casey.\n\n \n\n He takes a drag from his rollie and chuckles. “What gave it away?”\n\n \n\n You glance at the cigarette, causing him to laugh further. You grimace when the laughter inevitably turns to coughing.\n\n \n\n “I was born and bred in Hackney,” Casey tells you. “Back before it all turned into fancy flats and coffee shops. Moved here about ten years ago. Wanted a quiet life. Didn’t know how quiet things could get.”\n\n \n\n “Why Charlton?” you ask him. \n\n \n\n “I was a boxer,” he replies after he takes a drag. “Almost went pro, didn’t quite make it. Had a nasty blow in the ring and Doctor said I needed a holiday. Ended up breaking down just down the road and spent the week here getting the motor fixed. Liked the quiet life so much that when I got back to the big smoke, it felt like poison every time I took a breath.”\n\n \n\n He puts his roll-up in his mouth and inhales. “Irony and such like,” he mutters as smoke drifts out of his mouth. “I know.”\n\n \n\n You nod, watching the roll-up burn. “What do you think of it? The town, I mean.” \n\n \n\n Casey grins wryly. “Well I must not mind it too much if I spend a decade here.” After another drag, he continues. “It’s like going back to when I was younger. Some of that’s good. Some of it’s bad. All things being squared, I think it balances out.“\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “I’m interested in signing up for classes,” you tell Casey. “What do you have here?”\n\n \n\n “Boxing for the blokes, ballet for the girls,” Casey sighs, blowing out smoke through his nostrils. \"Flo tried to start up some yoga, but that business with the karate chops put the skids on it.”\n\n \n\n “Karate chopping?” you ask.\n\n \n\n He sniggers, and coughs from the action. “Yeah, got an old mate of mine to come up from London. Teach some of the kids some self-defense. Only they got carried away and judo chopped John Kaplar’s fence.” He pauses to take a drag from his roll-up, then continues. “Then that Owen Oakswood made a big song and dance of it in his paper. Next thing I know, I’ve got Chelsea Duncan and her women’s lib lot on the blower giving me an earful. So back to boxing.”\n\n \n\n You nod, feigning interest. “When do the lessons run?”\n\n \n\n “Only time that made sense was weekends,” Casey replies. “I do boxing at lunchtime, then Margaret DeBussy does a ballet class on afternoons. Just stop by and you can sign up. Never get enough to turn anyone away.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n “I’m thinking of signing up,” you tell Casey. “How much does it cost?”\n\n \n\n \n The side of his mouth twitches and he almost chokes on the smoke in his lungs. “You feeling alright, love? You’re already signed up. Got your name on a locker and everything. Don’t need to pay anymore. Feel free to use any of the equipment you like, or come and talk to me if you're thinking of doing one of the classes.”\n\n \n\n He takes a drag and offers you a pleasant smile, but says no more. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Casey quickly appraises you, but if he’s skeptical it doesn't show. “One time fee gets you access to the lockers and equipment. Classes are a bit extra, but not too much. Not exactly Kings Cross around here. I’ll take what I can get. You interested?”\n\n \n\n You shrug. Before you can say anything more, Casey has written out a form and has pushed it across the desk towards you. “Magic. Pop your name on here then and I’ll send you an invoice.”\n\n \n\n You pick up a pen and scrawl a signature. Casey takes back the form without looking at it. “Let me know if you want to sign up for a class. Otherwise, I’ll pop a name tag on a locker in the ladies. You can set the locker combo when you first use it. If you need some exercise gear, pop down to Evans. They’ve always got a sale on.”\n\n You pick up a pen and scrawl a signature. Casey takes back the form without looking at it. “Let me know if you want to sign up for a class. Otherwise, I’ll pop a name tag on a locker in the gents. You can set the locker combo when you first use it. If you need some exercise gear, pop down to Evans. They’ve always got a sale on.\"\n\n \n\n Casey slips the form into a drawer and takes out a laminated card to hand to you. It’s off-white, tarred from the cigarette tar that seeps into the fabric of everything Casey touches. “Here. Your membership card.”\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Casey quickly appraises you, but if he’s skeptical it doesn't show. “One time fee gets you access to the lockers and equipment. Classes are a bit extra, but not too much. Not exactly Kings Cross around here. I’ll take what I can get. You interested?”\n\n \n\n You grimace, unsure of how in this form you could even sign up for a gym membership. Sensing your reluctance, Casey shrugs. “Suit yourself,” he says. “If you change your mind, give us a holler.”\n\n \n\n Casey takes another drag from his cigarette and doesn’t say another word. If you want to sign up for the gym, you’ll need to be in a form you at least can pay legitimately for. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n You glance at the mats. “You setting up for the boxing class?”\n\n \n\n Casey doesn’t look up straight away. He finishes nudging the last mat into place with his boot, then finally meets your eye. “Wasn’t sure anyone’d bother showing,” he says. The roll-up twitches on his lip. “But yeah. I’m running it. You after a go?”\n\n \n\n You shrug, noting the cigarette still in the man’s mouth. “I’m considering it.”\n\n \n\n He nods, then tilts his head toward a pair of gloves draped over the ropes. “Won’t be bag work though. It’s sparring. Just you and me. I’ll show you how to keep your feet, throw clean. Nothin’ fancy. But you’ll need to hit back.”\n\n \n\n He grins, as if taunting you. You glance him over. He’s still got the frame. Heavy shoulders, hands like bricks. But there’s a stiffness in his leg when he shifts his weight. And that cigarette hasn’t moved since you walked in. You can’t help but wonder if this will be a proper sparring match or charity work.\n\n \n\n Suddenly, there’s a sharp knock on the window. You look up to see a group of teenage boys pressing against the glass, grinning like hyenas. They all seem focused on Casey. One of them throws his head back, miming a knockout punch while the others cackle.\n\n \n\n Casey glares, lifting a gloved hand and jabs it toward the window. “Oi! Off with ya! Go leer at a lamp post!”\n\n \n\n The boys retreat, half-laughing, half-lurking. You note though that they don’t leave. Instead, they fade from the window surface, their murky silhouettes still watching the two of you.\n\n \n\n “Bloody kids,” Casey says, turning back to you. “Only turn up to perve on the ballet class. Could do with a proper hiding, if you ask me.”\n\n \n\n You shrug, noncommittally. Casey sighs and shakes his head. “Well? You want a class, go get changed. I’ll be waiting.” He smirks, but almost coughs on the cigarette as he takes a drag.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n Change for the boxing class - *You'll need to buy workout gear from Evans' to participate*\n\n <>",

It seems you’ll have to do more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n “Hey Christina,\" you say. \"I need a favour.\"\n\n \n \n Christina glances back to the other girls practicing, then focuses on you. \"Sure Emily. We've got to look after each other, after all. How can I help?\"\n\n \n \n You take a step closer, lowering your voice. “I need you to cause a distraction after school. Enough to make Prichard leave her classroom.”\n\n \n\n Christina grins, raising an eyebrow. \"My, you're being inventive already, Emily. Good work.\"\n\n \n\n You feel yourself smiling at the compliment. \"Thank you.\"\n\n \n\n \"Are you sneaking in after she leaves?\" Christina eyes you curiously. \"Or are you planning on being held back after school?\"\n\n \n\n \"Detention,\" you admit to her.\n\n \n\n She nods. \"Sound plan. Just be careful. Prichard's punishments are very forceful. Plus, you're also a cheerleader now, Emily. You have a reputation to uphold. Detention is not a good look for our team.\"\n\n \n\n \"I'll be discreet,\" you assure her.\n\n \n\n \"Good.\" Chrissie appears to mull over something before continuing. \"I'll keep an eye out for you. If I see you entering the class after school, I'll come by and help.\"\n\n \n\n \"Thanks Chrissie,\" you say.\n\n \n\n She gives you a small grin. \"What are squad mates for.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You spend the next hour or so following Christina around the clothing department, as she studiously inspects every shoe, dress and skirt that the department store stocks. Her judgement is absolute. There’s little that meets her standards. \n\n \n\n When she does find something acceptable, more often than not you realise she’s shopping for you. She holds numerous blouses and skirts up against your body, asking for your opinion on whether you like it. “Too daggy?” she asks. “Too skimpy? Too much?” \n\n \n\n As you relax into the role of Christina’s clothes mannequin, you find yourself becoming more at ease with spending time this way. There is something empowering about someone looking out for you, trying to find something that will make you look great. \n\n \n\n “That would look divine on you,” Christina says as she holds up a silk black skirt. “Classy, elegant, but short enough to show off those legs. Jake and the boys would be on their hands and knees at the sight.” \n\n \n\n As you and Christina dart around the store, she also chatters about several rumours floating around about students at Charlton School. \"Did you hear this one?\" she whispers quietly. \"<> Can you believe it?\"\n\n As you and Christina dart around the store, she also chatters about several rumours floating around about students at Charlton School. Most are not news to you. Those that are hold no interest.\n\n \n\n Time flies by and you actually feel a twinge of disappointment when Christina tells you she needs to leave. \n\n \n\n “It’s been fun, Em,” she says to you as she says goodbye. “We should do this again sometime.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I’m sorry,” you tell her. “I have to get back home today.”\n\n \n\n Christina rolls her eyes, but laughs. “Live a little, Em. You can’t spend your life cooped up inside.”\n\n \n\n “I really can’t,” you enforce.\n\n \n\n “Some other time then,” she tells you. “I’ll be here for a while if you change your mind.”\n\n \n\n Christina returns to browsing the clothing. You decide for the moment to leave her.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n \n “Sure,” you tell Christina. “Why not.”\n\n \n\n She immediately looks at the salon assistant and raises her eyebrow. “Can you fit her in? My father will pay.” \n\n \n\n Over the next hour, your hair is given the full treatment. You relax as dye is smeared through your locks. You spend a lot of time with your head back as the make-over is applied, listening to Christina talk about the importance of grooming and training in equal measure. You focus straight ahead as fake eyelashes are stuck to your own.\n \n \n \n “Time for the big reveal,” Christina says after your hair is blow dried. She stands behind you and turns the chair around herself, facing you towards the mirror.\n\n \n\n You stare at your reflection, barely recognising your sister. Your hair is golden blonde, radiant and glistening. But the difference it makes to you is deeper. Instead of a mousy bookish girl, the blonde hair makes you look carefree and bubbly. Whereas previously Emily would have looked at home in a library, the girl in the mirror looks like she should be cheering alongside a football game.\n \n \n\n The make-up only enhances the stark change. Staring back is a Hollywood starlet. Large, pouty lips. Long and luscious lashes. Flawless skin and thick mascara. \n\n \n\n “See,” you hear Christina’s voice from behind you. “Told you that you had what it took.”\n\n \n\n You glance at your reflection again. You have never seen Emily wear this amount of make-up before. It’s almost too much for her. Or at least, casts her in a very different light. \n\n \n\n She helps you out of the chair, still admiring your new look. “Now. Remember what I said, Em.” she tells you. “Prove you belong on the squad. When you have, come see me at practice.”\n\n \n\n Without another word, Christina turns and walks out of the salon. You assume that the payment will just be added to her father’s account.\n\n \n “Sure,” you tell Christina. “Why not.”\n\n \n\n She immediately looks at the salon assistant and raises her eyebrow. “Can you fit her in? My father will pay.” A reluctant nod gives Christina the encouragement she needs, and she gestures to the seat next to her.\n\n \n\n Over the next hour, your hair is given the full treatment. You relax as dye is smeared through your locks. You spend a lot of time with your head back, listening to Christina talk about the importance of grooming and training in equal measure.\n\n \n\n “Time for the big reveal,” Christina says after your hair is blow dried.

Whereas previously Emily would have looked at home in a library, the girl in the mirror looks like she should be cheering alongside a football game.\n\n \n\n “Perfect,” Christina says. “I knew you had potential.”\n\n \n\n She helps you out of the chair, still admiring your new look. “Now. Remember what I said, Em.” she tells you. “Prove you belong on the squad. When you have, come see me at practice.”\n\n \n\n Without another word, Christina turns and walks out of the salon. You assume that the payment will just be added to her father’s account.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n “Maybe some other time,” you tell her, trying to meet her eyes in the mirror.\n\n \n\n She rolls her eyes. “Honestly Emily, are you really going to fight me on every little thing? One day you’ll learn that I’m just looking out for you.”\n\n \n\n Despite Christina’s judgemental tone, you note a slight smile on her face as she looks in the mirror back at you. \n\n \n\n It’s now your turn to receive the finishing touches to your make-over. You focus straight ahead as fake eyelashes are stuck to your own. Your view glazes over and becomes fuzzy. Only when you are told to relax do you blink a few times and refocus your eyes, seeing the reflection in front of you.\n\n \n\n You have to move your face to believe that you are looking in a mirror. The person staring back at you looks like a Hollywood starlet. Large, pouty lips. Long and luscious lashes. Flawless skin and thick mascara. \n\n \n\n “See,” you hear Christina’s voice from behind you. “Told you that you had what it took.”\n\n \n\n You glance at your reflection again. You have never seen Emily wear this amount of make-up before. It’s almost too much for her. Or at least, casts her in a very different light. \n\n \n\n “I mean it, Emily,” Christina purrs from behind you. “Prove you belong on the squad. When you have, come see me at practice.”\n\n \n\n Without another word, Christina turns and walks out of the salon. You assume that the payment will just be added to her father’s account.\n \n \n “Maybe some other time,” you tell her, trying to meet her eyes in the mirror.\n\n \n\n She rolls her eyes. “Honestly Emily, are you really going to fight me on every little thing? One day you’ll learn that I’m just looking out for you.”\n\n \n\n Despite Christina’s judgemental tone, you note a slight smile on her face as she looks in the mirror back at you. \n\n \n\n Once Christina’s make-over is complete, she stands up and appraises herself in the mirror, before turning to you. “I mean it, Emily,” she adds. “Prove you belong on the squad. When you have, come see me at practice.”\n\n \n\n Without another word, Christina turns and walks out of the salon. You assume that the payment will just be added to her father’s account.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n “Okay,” you say, sitting down at the chair next to Christina.\n\n \n\n You make small talk as you are prepared for a full make-over. Products are laid out in front of you, from blusher and foundation to shades of lipstick and mascara too numerous to digest. A series of fake eyelashes are spread in front of you, but no attempt is made to ask you which set you’d prefer.\n\n \n\n \n \n Rhiannon goes to work, wordlessly applying a cleanser to your face before starting the process of working your face over with the variety of products. She rarely makes eye contact with you, and avoids looking at Christina entirely.\n\n \n Sophie begins to apply cleanser to your face, prepping it for the application of make-up. She works professionally and diligently, but doesn’t say a word to either Christina or you.\n\n \n \n\n As you are pampered, Christina makes small talk, asking you about how you’re settling into the town and what your life was like before coming to Charlton. Her questions are pointed, but she seems genuinely curious about you.\n\n \n\n “I meant what I said before,” she tells you, as the conversation touches upon life at the school. “You need a bit of work, clearly, but I want you on the squad. The question is, how much do you want it?”\n\n \n\n “There’s a pecking order at Charlton,” she continues. “Cheerleaders and jocks at the top. Nerds and outcasts at the bottom. I want to see you at the top of the food chain. If you can prove you belong at the top, there’s a spot on the squad waiting for you.”\n\n <>\n \n\n \n You look at Rhiannon in the mirror, applying some lashes to Christina’s face. She remains silent, ignoring the conversation taking place. You are almost shocked by Christina’s brazen attitude in talking this way in front of other people.\n\n \n You glance at Sophie in the mirror, applying lashes to Christina’s face. She doesn’t react to the conversation. Christina doesn’t seem at all embarrassed by how brazen she is discussing this in front of her.\n\n \n \n\n \n ”By the way, the colour really suits you,” Christina says, glancing at your hair. “Perfect for the squad. Be sure to keep it that way.”\n\n \n\n It’s now your turn to receive the finishing touches to your make-over. You focus straight ahead as fake eyelashes are stuck to your own. Your view glazes over and becomes fuzzy. Only when you are told to relax do you blink a few times and refocus your eyes, seeing the reflection in front of you.\n\n \n\n You have to move your face to believe that you are looking in a mirror.

You have never seen Emily wear this amount of make-up before. It’s almost too much for her. Or at least, casts her in a very different light. \n\n \n\n “I mean it, Emily,” Christina purrs from behind you. “Prove you belong on the squad. When you have, come see me at practice.”\n\n \n\n Without another word, Christina turns and walks out of the salon. You assume that the payment will just be added to her father’s account.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"You know, you should really consider going blonde?\" Christina continues. \"The mousy brown hair has a certain bookish chic appeal, but it doesn’t convey the vibrancy and energy we’re looking for. What do you say? Fancy a change?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <> \n \n \n \n\n \n “I’m good thanks,” you say, instead sitting on the pink sofa near the entrance.\n\n \n\n Christina gives you a look in the mirror. “Really, Emily. You should learn to treat yourself” she tells you. “If you're not going to trust me, take a look at that issue of Seventeen. I think that’s the latest issue, isn’t it?” she asks, directing her eyes at the salon assistant. It sounds more like a challenge than a question.\n\n \n\n \n You flick through the magazine idly, as Christina has her make-up done. She talks at you as she sits, asking you about how you’re settling into the town and what your life was like before coming to Charlton. Her questions are pointed, but she seems genuinely curious about you.\n\n \n\n “I meant what I said before,” she tells you, as the conversation touches upon life at the school. “You need a bit of work, clearly, but I want you on the squad. The question is, how much do you want it?”\n\n \n\n “There’s a pecking order at Charlton,” she continues. “Cheerleaders and jocks at the top. Nerds and outcasts at the bottom.

What do you say? Fancy a change?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n\n “So, magic is real?” you ask Christina. She grins.\n \n \n\n “It’s not so strange, is it?” she replies. “You’ve spent some time here. Surely you must have suspected something was up. The curses certainly haven’t grabbed hold of you.”\n\n \n\n “What is it? How can it be real?”\n\n \n\n Christina leans forward, smiling patiently. “I’ll tell you what I know. It feels like a power, living inside of you. Only women can use it. But it flows through everyone and everything.” She gestures around to the gym. “Even this room. Although we nullify its effect when we gather here.”\n\n \n\n “How do people not know about it?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “People see what they want to see,” she replies, nonchalantly. “Those with the affinity share a solemn vow not to divulge its existence outside of the coven. We’re taking a risk on you.”\n\n \n\n “A big risk,” Reagan interjects. \n\n \n\n “Imagine it,” Christina continues, ignoring the interruption. “The power to manipulate people. Sway people’s emotions. Alter their memories. It isn’t something to be treated lightly.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “So you’re all, what?” you ask. “Witches?” \n\n \n\n Britney sniggers, but quickly stops after Christina throws her a look. “I wouldn’t call us that,” she says, turning back to you. “The cheerleader squad is what we call a coven. \n\n \n\n “We can all cast magic,” she says, casting another look at Britney. “To some degree.”\n\n \n\n “But to perform our duties we operate as five. The power of a full coven is significant compared to the lone wanderer. That is one of the reasons we’ve reached out to you.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes flick around the room. Stacey. Britney. Reagan. Christina. And now you.\n\n <>\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “Can you teach me magic?” you ask.\n\n \n\n Christina nods. “If you join us. When you’re done with questions, I’ll show you how to perform a little thing. Give you a taste of what’s to come. Then, if you prove willing, there is a whole world of power waiting for you.”\n\n \n\n You nod, looking around the room. “Did you teach everyone here?” \n\n \n\n “Christina recruited us,” Stacey chimes in. “She taught us everything we know.”\n\n \n\n Glancing around, you see a degree of pride on Stacey and Britney’s faces. Only Reagan seems sullen and unwilling to engage with you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “You mentioned your duties,” you tell her. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n\n Christina smiles and nods, eager to share. “Charlton is a special place. For generations the cheerleaders have been taught the magical arts. It’s passed down from person to person, so order is maintained. You must have noticed how idyllic Charlton is? We work with the teachers to make sure every generation maintains that.”\n\n \n\n You nod, understanding more than Christina knows. “What do you do?” \n\n \n\n “We enchant objects within the school. Magic that helps steer the students in the right direction. Course correct deviant behaviour. Ensure they graduate to be the best they can be.”\n\n \n\n “Do people not realise?” \n\n \n\n Christina gives you a measured look. “Some. Not many though. Let’s just say it brings out their natural impulses. And smooths down the rough edges.”\n\n <>\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “You mentioned the teachers,” you say. “So they know?”\n\n \n\n Christina nods. “Some. Those that do are our advocates. We work with them to help guide the other students. Most of the teachers are men. Magic evades them. So they ask us to support them. In turn, we are given special privileges. Now, and in the future.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n\n “Why, we rule the school,” Christina replies, laughter in her voice. Stacey and Britney titter too. \n\n \n\n “Hall passes. Free periods. Plus, there’s not a cheerleader in memory who hasn’t passed her exams with top grades. And grades mean education. Good jobs. Influence.”\n\n \n\n She leans further towards you, lowering her voice. “If you join us, you won’t ever have to worry about passing school.”\n\n <>\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “When you said curses…” you begin.\n\n \n\n Britney and Stacey laugh between them, knowingly. Christina smiles warmly. “It’s a bit dramatic, isn’t it? Probably needs a rebrand. But Charlton is very traditional.”\n\n \n\n “There’s objects around the school. Embedded with magic. We just make sure that the spells are working. I can teach you how to do it, if you join us. But they’re just parlour tricks. Simple manipulation of urges and desires. Real power is what we keep to ourselves.”\n\n \n\n The cheerleaders share satisfied looks amongst themselves. “Oh my gawd, Em” Britney says to you. “You’re gonna’ love it.”\n\n \n\n Christina gives her a look, silently shushing her down, and turns back to you. “As you have demonstrated, they aren’t so bad. Some might say bringing a little order to some of the deviants in Charlton should be praised. Myself being one of them.”\n\n <>\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You glance at Christina, who waits for you to speak. “Hey Chrissie, I was wondering if you had any strange dreams after you started using magic?”\n\n \n\n She frowns but looks curious. “Nothing out of the ordinary. Why, has something happened?”\n\n \n\n You hesitate as you choose your words carefully. “Just some intense dreams. Almost as if they were real.”\n\n \n\n Christina looks at you, studying. “I can’t say I’ve experienced that,” she says, after a moment. “Nor heard of it. Are you sure it wasn’t just an intense dream?”\n\n \n\n You shrug, careful not to reveal too much. “Maybe. But I’ve noticed some other things. Things that weren’t right. Or more like, I’ve felt something was off.”\n\n \n\n To your surprise, she nods along with you. “Your feelings are a big part of what makes you powerful. You should trust them. Magic is just a projection of our inner willpower exerting itself over reality, after all.”\n\n \n\n You briefly consider that the words seem jarring to come from Christina. You wonder where she got them from. But you dismiss it, trying to move the conversation along. “I feel since I’ve been practicing that maybe I’m changing. But I don’t know how.”\n\n \n\n Christina gives you a sympathetic smile. “Emily, that’s perfectly understandable. You’re learning your new place in this world. My advice - embrace it. Leave behind who you were. It’s what we do now that matters.”\n\n \n\n The cheerleader turns her smile to a grin, satisfied in her tutorage. You can only smile back at her, hiding your disappointment in her advice.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You step forward and run your hand over the selection, considering each piece carefully. Eventually, you pull out an outfit. A top and skirt, something simple but flattering.\n\n \n\n “This one works,” you say decisively. “It’s clean, stylish, and actually pretty cute.”\n\n \n\n Christina’s brows lift, her lips pressing together as she considers your choice. For a moment, you think she might argue. But then she hums, nodding slightly.\n\n \n\n “Well, at least you’ve got some basic instincts, I suppose.” She turns back to Jennifer, eyes sharp. “Still, this is barely passable. Next time, I expect better. Find something suitable for Emily's first trip to the Kaplar's country club.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks at you, with narrowed eyes. You can see her trying to understand the scenario, but caught in a web where she can say nothing. Instead she nods and silently walks out.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You sigh, stepping closer to the clothes and making a show of flipping through them, unimpressed.\n\n \n\n “This is just… bland,” you say, shaking your head. “None of these stand out.\"\n\n \n\n Jennifer's eyes lock on to you. You see the betrayal flash beneath her attempts to remain professional.\n\n \n\n Christina’s lips curl into a slow smile.\n\n \n\n “Exactly,” she purrs, turning toward Jennifer with a small shake of her head. “Honestly, Jennifer, I thought you’d know better. I suppose working this job dulls one’s sense of fashion over time.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s jaw tenses, but she nods. “I’ll try again,” she murmurs. You know that tone. You've dealt with it once or twice, even. She's furious.\n\n \n\n Christina smirks, turning back to you.\n\n \n\n “See, Em? You’re getting it,” she says approvingly. “Knowing what doesn’t work is just as important as knowing what does.”\n\n \n\n She waves a dismissive hand. “Jennifer. Try again. Find something suitable for Emily's first trip to the Kaplar's country club. If you don’t get it right this time…” Her voice trails off, but the implication is enough.\n\n \n\n Jennifer bristles, but turns around and heads back into the store. As soon as she’s gone, Christina folds her arms, glancing at you with clear amusement.\n\n \n\n “I can see us getting along swimmingly,” she says lightly.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You exhale slowly, nodding. “Yeah… I guess this is the look for a country club.”\n\n \n\n Christina’s smile spreads like honey. “Good,” she says, handing you the dress and motioning toward the cubicle. “Now let’s see it on you.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer blinks, momentarily caught off guard. You offer her a smile and take the dress into the changing cubicle, the fabric feeling almost too smooth in your hands. The moment you slide it over your body, the transformation is unmistakable. The dress hugs your waist, flares out in a dramatic sweep of fabric, and moves with an effortless grace that feels… unnatural. You turn slightly, catching your reflection. For a moment, it doesn’t feel like you looking back.\n\n \n\n And then Christina yanks the curtain open. Her eyes gleam with satisfaction. “Good,” she declares. “A little too much for my liking, but you make it work, Em.”\n\n \n\n \"Now,\" Christina says, turning to Jennifer with a grin. \"For the final test. Emily has got a big date coming up with Brendan Glove, one of our star football players. Bring her some options to dress to impress.\"\n\n \n\n \"I have?\" you ask, nervously.\n\n \n\n \"Hypothetically,\" Christina replies. \"But I'm sure we can work on that.\"\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks to you with an eyebrow raised. You can only shrug. The frustration is almost drained from her face. Instead, replaced by bafflement. She quickly exits, wordlessly.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You eye the outfit in your hands, the pristine pink fabric, the delicate lace trim. It’s ridiculous. You can’t imagine yourself in this. You won’t.\n\n \n\n Your lips press into a thin line before you scoff, tossing the dress carelessly back onto the pile. “I'm not wearing this” you say, loud enough for Jennifer to hear. “What is this? A fancy dress costume for a housewife?”\n\n \n \n Jennifer’s eyes snap to you, startled. You try to avoid her look. You know what Christina wants to hear. You can do it, but you can't look at her whilst you say it.\n\n \n\n “Really? This?” you continue. “This isn't me. What part of me says ‘frilly little doll’? It's awful.”\n\n \n\n Christina laughs softly, but it’s the kind of laugh that’s meant for Jennifer’s humiliation, not yours.\n\n \n\n Jennifer doesn’t move for a moment. But you see it. The way her fingers tighten, the way her posture goes rigid like she’s forcing herself to hold back. Her eyes burrow into you, simmering with rage.\n\n \n\n Christina smirks, flipping idly through the discarded clothes with a single manicured finger. “Honestly, Jennifer, it’s like you’re doing this on purpose.” She sighs, tilting her head. “Or maybe getting old has dulled your taste. It’s sad, really.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s jaw tenses visibly, but she nods. “I’ll try again,” she mutters, clipped and controlled.\n\n \n\n “You will,” Christina agrees, her voice light, almost mocking. “Because I’d hate to have to explain to my father why one of his employees can’t even follow simple instructions. Go find something for Emily. She has a little date coming up with a football player.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer stiffens. You watch as she inhales slowly, steadies herself. Then turns on her heel and walks back out into the store without another word.\n\n \n\n Christina grins, folding her arms as she looks at you. “Now that,” she says, clearly pleased, “is how you handle the help.”\n\n \n\n You try to put Jennifer out of your mind. That face. That anger. \"A date?\" you quickly remember.\n\n \n\n \"Just a thought experiment, Em,\" Christina says. \"But you never know. I'm sure there's plenty of charming young men who would like to court you.\"\n\n \n\n “Let’s hope she does better this time.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You hesitate, but not for the reason you expect. Your fingers brush over the fabric. It’s soft. Inviting. The thought replays in your mind. You, in this dress, on that date.\n\n \n\n A moment later, you nod. “Yeah… I think I can.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks at you, momentarily stunned. She had been expecting a cruel remark. But instead, you take the dress from Christina’s hands and step into the cubicle, heart pounding just slightly harder than before.\n\n \n\n The moment you slip it over your head, it’s like stepping into a new skin.\n\n \n\n The fabric clings, accentuating every line of your body. The way it shapes you, the way the mirror frames your figure. Even as Emily, you barely recognize yourself.\n\n \n\n Her? You barely recognise her. Right?\n\n \n \n And yet… you don’t hate it. Your mind drifts again. To that movie date, to the way that football player would look at you. And for the first time, you don’t push the thought away.\n\n \n\n Christina pulls the curtain back, eyeing you critically. “Well, well,” she says, lips curving into a smile. “Would you look at that?”\n\n \n\n She tilts her head. “You almost look comfortable.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer doesn’t say anything, but there’s a flicker of something in her eyes.\n\n \n\n Confusion. Worry.\n\n \n\n Maybe even disappointment.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You let out a short, incredulous laugh, tossing the dress back onto the bench.\n\n \n\n “This is ridiculous,” you say, shaking your head. “Seriously, Jennifer? What, do you think I’m trying to pick up guys at a bar?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s expression doesn’t change, but the way her jaw tightens tells you enough.\n\n \n\n Christina’s grin widens. “Exactly,” she drawls, letting the dress slip from her fingers onto the pile. “It’s inappropriate. Honestly, Jennifer, what’s gotten into you?”\n\n \n\n She folds her arms, tilting her head mockingly. “You know, back when I was a junior, I actually looked up to you. Thought you had taste. But this?” She gestures vaguely at the pile of daring outfits. “Seems like someone’s spent too much time on the shop floor. The gutter must be rubbing off on you.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s nostrils flare, but she doesn’t take the bait. Instead, she inclines her head slightly, her voice clipped. “I’ll find something else.”\n\n \n\n \"Don't bother,\" Christina says smoothly. “I'll be letting my dad know how helpful you've been.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer doesn’t reply. Just turns sharply and leaves.\n\n \n\n Christina smirks, turning back to you. “Perfect, Em!” she murmurs, her voice almost pleased. “That's how to let people know their place. Wear it like an accessory for all to see.”\n\n \n\n She brushes a hand lightly over your bare shoulder as she steps past you, voice dropping to something almost conspiratorial.\n\n \n\n “And you know what? It looks good on you.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n “I wanted to ask… is there any kind of magic that lets someone change their appearance?”\n\n \n\n “I don’t think you need diet pills,” Christina says, grinning. \n\n \n\n “No,” you reply. “Like changing completely. Changing someone… into someone else.”\n\n \n\n She studies you for a moment, expression sharpening slightly. “Magic doesn’t work like that,” she says. “Charlton isn’t a school for witchcraft and wizardry. Magic’s influence is mental. Subtle. It changes how people think. How they feel.”\n\n \n\n “So,” you say, cautiously, “you don’t know of anything that changes form?”\n\n \n\n Christina shakes her head. “No. If I did, you can bet you'd see at least one of me having fun instead of knocking these girls into shape.”\n\n \n\n You’re quiet for a beat, then ask - boldly, “But hypothetically, if it was possible… who would know?”\n\n \n\n Christina narrows her eyes. Just slightly. “That’s a strange question.”\n\n \n\n You try to cover. “Just… curious.”\n\n \n\n “Hm.” She steps slightly closer, still smiling, but with more calculation behind her eyes now.\n\n \n\n “Magic is passed down through the squad,” she says. “Controlled. Trusted. We don’t learn spells from dusty books or mysterious strangers. We inherit them. Share them. In time, I’ll teach you what you need to know.”\n\n \n\n “And what about when you don’t know?” you ask.\n\n \n\n Christina gives you a knowing smile. “Then I get help. From a friend.”\n\n \n\n You tilt your head. “Who?”\n\n \n\n She chuckles. “You’ll find out. One day.”\n\n \n\n You’re not sure if that’s a promise… or a warning.\n\n \n\n “But take it from me,” she adds, stepping back and motioning toward the rest of the squad. “Case in point - magic in Charlton isn’t flashy. It doesn’t shoot sparks or transform people into frogs.”\n\n \n\n She meets your eyes. “It changes feelings. And feelings… change everything.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes glint with energy. Sensing something primal underneath, you decide not to push her further.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You lift your chin and let your voice carry just enough edge. “I get by perfectly well on my own, Christina.”\n\n \n\n An eyebrow shoots up. “You think you’re getting by?”\n\n \n\n A grin this time forms on your face. “I think I do okay. I don’t need Daddy’s money to buy a dress.”\n\n \n\n Her carefully poised smile falters, surprise flickering in her icy eyes before she smooths it back into place. “Well, I’ll be damned,” she murmurs, stepping closer so her words drop between you. “I thought Jennifer destroyed your backbone.”\n\n \n\n She leans in towards you, a smile forming again. “Careful though, Annie. I’m not as soft as her. And unlike her, I make sure I do things properly.”\n\n \n\n The teenager looks at you with presence and power beyond her age. You meet her look, but say nothing. When she breaks away you take the opportunity to walk off.\n \n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You lift your chin, but your voice wavers. “I… I manage,” you stammer, forcing a tight smile.\n\n \n\n Christina’s lips curl into a lightly mocking laugh. “Manage?” she repeats, arching an eyebrow. “Sweetheart, relying on that repair-shop wage to pull off any look must be quite the challenge.” Her eyes appraise you again. “Even something as trashy as that.”\n\n \n\n She flicks a finger at a nearby rack. “Enjoy your… browsing.”\n\n \n\n With that, she turns on a heel and melts back into the aisle, leaving you standing alone among the dresses.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “I’ve noticed some strange behaviour from Britney, Reagan and Stacey recently,\" you begin. \"They've been spending a lot of time with Terrence.”\n\n \n\n She turns to you and her lips curve into a slow, dark smile. “So you noticed,” she murmurs, voice smooth. She reaches out, brushing a stray hair from your face. “That took some sharp eyes.”\n\n \n\n You meet her gaze. “What are you doing to him?”\n\n \n\n She doesn’t flinch. Instead, the smile curves deeper.\n\n \n\n “We’re helping,” she says. “Terrence was drifting. Always on the edges. Quiet, unsure. But he’s clever. Just needed structure.”\n\n \n\n Her voice lowers, the weight of something practiced in it.\n\n \n\n “He’s doing better.” She tilts her head, just enough for the light to catch in her eyes. “He’s becoming who he should have been.”\n\n \n\n “How are you doing that?” you say. “I can help.”\n\n \n\n Christina looks at you, assessing. “All in good time, Emily,” she replies. “Soon, I will need your help. For now, if you really want to help, there is something. I want to see what he keeps hidden in his biology book.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “What?”\n\n \n\n “Something is interfering,” she whispers, smile fading. “I want to know what.”\n\n \n\n “You think it’s magic?” you murmur, looking around. \n\n \n\n “I think people don’t suddenly get better at biology without help. I want to know who. And why. Try finding a way to open his locker at lunch. I’m sure you can figure out a way to do that.”\n\n \n\n She steps back, brushing imaginary dust from her skirt. That perfect smile returns. “You have good instincts, Emily. Use them.” Then, softer, with just a trace of warning. “Don’t make me wait.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \"I know what you're planning on doing to Terrence,\" you tell Christina flatly.\n\n \n\n For a second, you see the surprise threaten to spread across her face. But a moment later it's gone. Instead, she just smiles. \"Pray tell, dear Emily. What do you think you know?\"\n\n \n\n \"I know you're going to try to change him,\" you tell her. \"Using a ritual. In the gym.\"\n\n \n\n \"Someone has a nosy little narc,\" she says, playfully mocking. \"What do you think about it?\"\n\n \n\n \"I want to help,\" you say. Wondering how much of those words are the truth.\n\n \n\n Christina eyes you carefully, then nods. \"Alright. Come by the gym. Wait for us in the evening. I will explain everything then. But just remember, Em. This is a big step for you. You don't have to do this, if you don't feel ready.\"\n\n \n\n She offers you a friendly smile. It's practiced and polished, but for Christina, it almost seems genuine.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <> \n \n “Christina,” you say quietly. “Do you know how I could get a hall pass?”\n\n \n\n \n She turns her head toward you with a sly smile. “Oh? And why exactly do you need to be sneaking out of lessons? Or do I want to know the answer to that question?”\n\n \n\n You hesitate. “I… want to check the boys’ classes. I want to make sure the curses are still active.”\n\n \n\n Christina raises a brow, her interest piqued. “Smart thinking, Em” she purrs. “I’m quite sure I would have noticed if anything was amiss, but a little check-up wouldn’t hurt. I knew you belonged on the squad.”\n\n \n\n She steps away and saunters over to her bag by the boombox. Unzipping a side pocket of her bag, she pulls out a single hall pass and returns to you, holding it delicately between two fingers.\n\n \n\n “Here,” she says. “Fill in your details and hand this to Harrow or Prichard. They won’t question it. Tell them you’ve got squad business and flash that smile of yours.”\n\n \n\n You reach for it, but she doesn’t let go immediately.\n\n \n\n “But Em,” she says, her voice lowering. “Just look. Do not go inside. Trust me, those lessons aren’t somewhere respectable girls like us want to end up.”\n\n \n\n She lets go of the pass, the smile never leaving her lips.\n\n \n\n “Report back if anything is out of place. And don’t do anything reckless. Those lessons get… rowdy.”\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <> \n \n She turns her head towards you with a forced smile. \"Oh? And what exactly makes you feel that you deserve such privileges yet, Emily?\"\n\n \n\n When you part your lips and take a shallow breath, Christina corrects herself, stifling a giggle that sounds practiced. \"I'm just playing with you, Em. I understand all too well the desire to make your own way in the world. Bend the rules a little, so to speak.\"\n\n \n\n Chrissie glances back to check on the progress of the squad, before turning to survey you with her cold blue eyes. \"As far as I know, there's only two ways of getting a hall pass. Sign up for the cheerleaders, or improve your grades enough for the headmaster to notice.\"\n\n \n\n \n \n \"I'm afraid I'm still not convinced you have what it takes to be a cheerleader,\" she adds, with a slight wince that seems mechanical. \"But try speaking to Mr. Stitch if you can. I'm sure there are less athletically intensive routes to obtaining one.\"\n\n \n\n A shriek from the squad captures Christina's attention and she turns her attention away from you, instantly forgetting the conversation in-flow.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \"You're making good progress in joining our team, Em,\" she adds, giving you a smile that borders on genuine. \"Keep it up, and I'll be able to give you a pass after your initiation.\"\n\n \n\n A shriek from the squad captures Christina's attention and she turns her attention away from you, instantly forgetting the conversation in-flow.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \"You should try out for the team,\" she adds. \"Like I said, I think you've got what it takes.\"\n\n \n\n Britney howls from the pitch, taking Christina's eyes away from you. \"There was a bug!\" you hear Britney cry back at Chrissie, as if to answer her unspoken question.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n \n\n “I had some trouble with a spell,” you begin. “I tried casting it on the school janitor, but it didn’t work.”\n\n \n\n Christina shoots you a wary look, accompanied only by a slight grin. “I’m not surprised, Em. The teachers don’t like us using magic on them without their permission. Did anyone see?”\n\n \n\n Quickly, you shake your head. “It was in the basement. No one saw.”\n\n \n\n She lets out a small titter, her grin widening. “Probably for the best. The headmaster has certain ways of limiting our abilities. Especially on faculty members. What on earth made you want to try magic on that repulsive janitor?”\n\n \n\n “I was trying to get a key from him,” you tell her truthfully. “To keep an eye on the wards.”\n\n \n\n Christina offers you a reassuring smile, tittering again. “I commend your enthusiasm, Em. But really. You should find other ways to get a look at them. With our cheerleader privileges, surely it can’t be that hard?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "“You went to Charlton Upper School, didn’t you?” you ask him. “What did you think of it?”\n\n \n\n “It was pretty swell, as school goes,” he says. “Used to play a bit of rugby. Still can throw a ball with the best of them.” He flashes you a smile.\n\n \n\n “Did you ever notice anything strange going on?” you try, pressing him.\n\n \n\n “No more than anywhere else. Bit of bullying, bit of favouritism. Some social darwinism, if you get my meaning. I bet you would have ranked top of the food chain when you were at school, that right darlin'?\"\n\n \n\n His disarming smile diminishes your eye rolling. \"Did you notice anything odd?\" you press on. \"About the lessons?”\n\n \n\n “Yeah. Lots of equations. Couldn’t understand any of them. Never used one since. I'm more of a do'er and a thinker than a fancy academic. Algebra never impressed a pretty lady.” His eyes sparkle as he looks at you.\n \n \n\n Clive scoops up some of the tools and puts them back in the kit. “As much as I like spending time talking to beautiful girls, I got a job to get to. Tell you what, though. Come by McTafey’s in the evening and I'll buy you a drink. Then I'll have all the time in the world for you.\"\n\n \n\n Clive gives you yet another smile and returns to sorting through his equipment, leaving you watching him.\n \n \n “You went to Charlton Upper School, didn’t you?” you ask him. “What did you think of it?”\n\n \n\n “It was pretty swell, as school goes,” he says. “Used to play a bit of rugby.

I bet you would have ranked top of the food chain when you were at school, that right darlin'?\"\n\n \n\n His disarming smile diminishes your eye rolling. \"Why’s that?\" he continues, moving on. \"Your sister having a hard time there?”\n\n \n\n You nod, just a little. “A little,” you tell him. “Did you notice anything odd? About the lessons?”\n\n \n\n “Yeah. Lots of equations. Couldn’t understand any of them. Never used one since. I'm more of a do'er and a thinker than a fancy academic. Algebra never impressed a pretty lady.” His eyes sparkle as he looks at you.\n \n \n\n Clive scoops up some of the tools and puts them back in the kit. “As much as I like spending time talking to beautiful girls, I got a job to get to.

Coach always did alright by me. Some weren’t so lucky.”\n\n \n\n “Did you ever notice anything strange going on?” you try, pressing him.\n\n \n\n He frowns. “No more than anywhere else. Bit of bullying, bit of favouritism. Some social darwinism, if you get my meaning. Why’s that, Phillips? Your sister having a hard time there?”\n\n \n\n You give him a noncommittal shrug. “Just making sure she’s alright,” you tell him. “Did you notice anything odd? About the lessons?”\n\n \n\n “Yeah. Lots of equations. Couldn’t understand any of them. Never used one since.”\n \n \n\n Clive scoops up some of the tools and puts them back in the kit. “As much as I’d like to tell you about the good old days of ten years ago, I got a job to get to. But swing by McTafey’s in the evening and we can grab a beer. Sounds like you’ve got something on your mind.\"\n\n \n\n Clive returns to sorting through his equipment, paying no more attention to you.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n “I’d like to ask you about Charlton School,” you tell him. “You went there, right?”\n\n \n\n He nods, giving you a smile. “A while back. Graduated a fair few years before you were a freshman, I'd wager. Or are you city girls just naturally youthful?”\n\n \n\n You smile politely at his compliment, but push forward. “It sounds different to where I went to school.”\n\n \n\n Clive nods his head, as he takes a sip of his drink. “I bet. Pretty traditional. Boys will be boys. Girls are girls. If you don’t agree with that, it’s a hard time there.”\n\n \n\n Rhiannon walks past, hearing the conversation. She smirks. “I thought you had a hard time because you skipped most lessons?”\n\n \n\n Clive grins at her, deflecting. “I still did okay. Not the top of the class, but I guess I didn’t make Stitch’s cut. Only those who toed his line got up to those giddy heights.“\n\n \n\n When Rhiannon moves on, Clive turns back to you. You give him a look. “Do you believe in all that traditional stuff?”\n\n \n\n He shrugs and smiles at you. “All manner of people in the world that believe in things. I believe that people should be a little less precious about what they believe in. Go with the flow. See where the world takes you.” \n \n \n “I’d like to ask you more about Charlton School,” you tell him. “My sister is struggling to settle in.”\n\n \n\n “The School’s polarising, in every way,” he tells you. “Boys against girls, popular against nerds. Kill or be killed too. My advice? Don’t rattle the teachers and pick a side. She’ll need friends to get through the year. But what’s she struggling with?” \n\n \n\n “The lessons are very traditional,” you say quietly. “More conservative. Different from her last school.”\n\n \n\n Clive nods, thinking. “Yeah. Bet it’s been a while that city schools said men should be the breadwinners and women stay at home. Charlton’s old like that. If you didn’t toe Stitch’s party line, you’re in some trouble. Had a few close calls with him, myself.”\n\n \n\n Rhiannon walks past, hearing the conversation. She smirks. “I thought you got in trouble because you couldn’t pass geography lessons?”\n\n \n\n Clive grins at her, deflecting. “Lived knowledge doesn’t come from books, sweetheart. What I know about I couldn’t learn at school. And I didn’t get fancy lessons from Stitch. Doesn’t matter how smart you are if you don’t have those. Magically the top of the table is out of bounds for you.“\n\n \n\n When Rhiannon moves on, Clive turns back to you. You give him a look. “Do you think what they teach is right?”\n\n \n\n He shrugs and takes a swig of his beer. “Don’t matter what I believe. I’m just a sparky. Only time I go to school these days is to fix the generator. Not everyone agrees with what’s taught at Charlton, though. I’d tell your sister to find like minded folk. With any luck, they can help each other out.”\n \n \n “I’d like to ask you about Charlton School,” you tell him. “You went there, right?”\n\n \n\n He nods, giving you a smile. “A few years before you, I’d wager. You must have only just graduated. Or you just look naturally pretty.”\n\n \n\n You smile politely at his compliment, but push forward. “I don’t think it’s changed much.”\n\n \n\n Clive shakes his head, as he takes a sip of his drink. “Pretty traditional. Boys will be boys. Girls are girls. If you don’t agree with that, it’s a hard time there.”\n\n \n\n Rhiannon walks past, hearing the conversation. She smirks. “I thought you had a hard time because you skipped most lessons?”\n\n \n\n Clive grins at her, deflecting. “I still did okay.

I believe that people should be a little less precious about what they believe in. Go with the flow. See where the world takes you.” \n \n \n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n ”How are you, Clive?” you ask him. \n\n \n\n “Doing just dandy, honey,” he says to you, taking a swig of his beer. “Got a beer in my hand, a paycheck in my pocket and I’m at a bar talking to a gorgeous girl. Can’t ask for more.”\n\n \n\n You can’t help but smile. Despite his lines sounding rehearsed, his disarming grin and casual honesty takes the embarrassment out of it. *In fact*, you think, as you feel your lips creep up. *It’s almost endearing.*\n\n \n\n “Did you grow up in Charlton?”, you ask him, leaning a little closer toward him.\n\n \n\n He nods. “Sure did. Born and raised here. Went to school, got a gig as an apprentice, worked my way into a trade. Just need the girl to complete the set. You know of anyone hiding away in the office that I've looked over?”\n\n \n\n He flashes you another smile and takes a swig from his bottle.\n\n \n\n “Did you ever want to do something else?”, you ask. “Go elsewhere?”\n\n \n\n He shrugs. “Not yet. Love to travel Europe in a van, but can wait for that. An honest day’s work, a cold beer and someone to warm the bed is still the dream.”\n\n \n\n “Anyone warming the bed right now?” you can’t help but ask.\n\n \n\n He grins back at you. “Position is vacant.”\n \n \n ”How are you, Clive?” you begin ever-so casually. “What’s happening with you?”\n\n \n\n He shrugs his shoulders. “Just living. Worse places to be than here.”\n\n \n\n You’re not sure that’s true, but you don’t challenge him. “Did you grow up in Charlton?”\n\n \n\n He nods. “Sure did. Born and raised here. Went to school, started at Thompsons’, worked my way out of apprenticeship and into a trade. Not a bad life.”\n\n \n\n “Did you ever want to do something else?” \n\n \n\n He grins. “Ambition comes in different shapes. For me, it’s all about freedom. Work when I work. Eat when I eat. Drink when I do. Sure, seeing the world has its appeal. But for me, nothing beats a cold beer after a hard day’s work.”\n\n \n ”How are you, Clive?” you ask him. \n\n \n\n “Doing just dandy, honey,” he says to you, taking a swig of his beer. “Got a beer in my hand, a paycheck in my pocket and I’m at a bar talking to a gorgeous girl. Can’t ask for more.”\n\n \n\n You can’t help but smile. Despite his lines sounding rehearsed, his disarming grin and casual honesty takes the embarrassment out of it. *In fact*, you think, as you feel your lips creep up. *It’s almost endearing.*\n\n \n\n “Did you grow up in Charlton?”, you ask him, leaning a little closer toward him.\n\n \n\n He nods. “Sure did.

Just need the girl to complete the set.”\n\n \n\n “Did you ever want to do something else?”, you ask. “Go elsewhere?”\n\n \n\n He shrugs. “Not so far. Love to travel Europe in a van, but not right now. An honest day’s work, a cold beer and someone to warm the bed is still the dream.”\n\n \n\n “Anyone warming the bed right now?” you can’t help but ask. \n\n \n\n He grins back at you. “Position is vacant.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n ”You spend a lot of time here?” you ask him as you glance around the bar.\n\n \n\n He grins, playing with a bar mat in his hand. “Not much else to do in Charlton,” he says. “A brief respite from the working day? All that typing you do must get real dull real fast, right?\"\n\n \n\n \"It's a bit more complex than that,\" you tell him.\n\n \n\n He shrugs. \"No offense meant, little lady. Just saying that after a day behind a desk, this is about liveliest place you'll find in our small little town.”\n\n \n\n You hear a sultry chuckle from the other side of the bar and look up to see Rhiannon moving past the two of you. “I’m so sorry we’re not entertaining enough for ya’,” she laughs. “Maybe if you didn’t spend every night here, it would seem more novel.”\n\n \n\n Clive focuses on you, purposefully not looking at the barmaid. “Ignore her. She gets irate when I get talking to a girl much prettier than her.”\n\n \n\n You look over the bar to Rhiannon, who smiles at you and rolls her eyes. She turns to serving other patrons. But you find yourself looking her over, taking in her emerald green eyes and luscious dark red hair. She has a sultry smile and a wicked laugh. She stands out from the crowd. \n\n \n\n Turning back to Clive, you see him grinning at you. “Much, much prettier,” he repeats, quietly. \n\n \n\n You can’t help it. There’s a smile forming and blood rushing to your cheeks. That’s the only place it’s rushing, right?\n \n \n ”You come here often?”, you ask him, looking around the bar. \n\n \n\n He wears a disarming smile as he looks around and meets the eyes of Rhiannon, who is keeping herself busy behind the bar. “Yup. Home from home. Someone has to keep little Rhiannon company on the winter nights.”\n\n \n\n “Oh, darl,” Rhiannon replies as she cleans. “You’re too skinny to keep me warm.” \n\n \n\n She gives him a wink and turns to serve a customer at the end of the bar. He chuckles. “She’s a real firecracker, that one.\"\n \n \n ”You come here often?” you ask him as you glance around the bar.\n\n \n\n He grins, playing with a bar mat in his hand. “Not much else to do in Charlton,” he says. “I’d love other places to go, but this is the liveliest place in our small little town.”\n\n \n\n You hear a sultry chuckle from the other side of the bar and look up to see Rhiannon moving past the two of you. “I’m so sorry we’re not entertaining enough for ya’,” she laughs. “Maybe if you didn’t spend every night here, it would seem more novel.”\n\n \n\n Clive focuses on you, purposefully not looking at the barmaid. “Ignore her. She gets irate when I get talking to a girl much prettier than her.”\n\n \n\n You look over the bar to Rhiannon, who smiles at you and rolls her eyes. She turns to serving other patrons.

She stands out from the crowd. \n\n \n\n Turning back to Clive, you see him grinning at you. “Much, much prettier,” he repeats, quietly. \n\n \n\n You can’t help it. There’s a smile forming and blood rushing to your cheeks. That’s the only place it’s rushing, right?\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n “Sure, I’d like that,” you tell him.\n \n \n\n He signals to Rhiannon to bring you both another drink and, with renewed confidence, starts chatting away. \n\n \n\n You spend the next few hours with Clive. The conversation drifts from topic to topic, and as the drinks start to flow you lose sight of fishing for specific information, instead enjoying the company. \n\n \n\n As Clive keeps ordering drinks, quickly you feel tipsy. You hear yourself giggling at his jokes, a feminine titter full of sing-song. You feel your cheeks grow flushed when he compliments your figure and your features. You can’t help but notice his eyes and warm smile and how he looks at you with honest and transparent interest.\n\n \n\n “You are really beautiful,” he tells you quietly, after the third drink. His eyes wander over your body, then back to your face. “Maybe it's time for a workplace dalliance. I make a habit of not shitting where I eat, but for you. I'd break all the rules, honey.”\n\n \n\n You feel yourself bite your lip as you look back at him. Whether it's the alcohol or something else, butterflies flutter in your stomach. \n\n \n\n Are you attracted to him?\n \n \n\n Faced with the troubling thought, you pick up your drink and down the dregs. Unfortunately, you miss the bar top when you put the glass back down and it falls off the rim, smashing on the floor.\n\n \n\n The bar patrons erupt in a collective cheer and you blush with embarrassment. Rhiannon gives you a sympathetic smile, rushing from behind the bar to clean up the shards. “Probably that’s enough for you this evening,” she says.\n\n \n\n You look from Rhiannon to Clive, who shrugs. “Lady’s got a point. You should get some rest. See you at work.”\n\n \n\n Taken aback a little at Clive’s blunt attitude, you stand. He smiles, any hint of desire absent from his face. Was it the alcohol playing tricks on you? Did you imagine him hitting on you?\n\n \n\n Or is that just what you wanted?\n \n \n\n You politely return the smile and leave the bar. \n\n \n “Why not?” you say, downing the rest of your drink.\n\n \n\n Clive gestures to Rhiannon to bring him another round. She quickly does and with renewed energy he continues the conversation. \n\n \n\n Over the next few hours you listen to Clive, moving from conversation to conversation. You lose focus on the conversation topic as he orders yet more drinks. Instead you take enjoyment in his wild theories and observations about life, death and everything between.\n\n \n\n As you and Clive work your way through rounds, he grows increasingly boisterous. He slams his glass down on the table when empty and encourages you to keep up with him. \n\n \n\n “Rhiannon”, he at one point slurs. “Shots.” He gestures to the bar in front of you.\n\n \n\n The room is wobbling slightly when the barmaid comes over. Her green eyes shine out at you, and her dark red hair seems to radiate in the warm light. She smiles coyly at you both as she pours out the two shots Clive has ordered.\n\n \n\n “Enjoy,” she says, looking at both of you individually before sauntering off. You watch her go, staring at her legs and her short, short skirt.\n\n \n\n Clive slaps your shoulder with his hand. “Shots,” he repeats as he thrusts a glass into your hand. “Here’s to… people. You’re a good sort, Phillips. Drink like a real man.”\n\n \n\n He chinks your glass and you slam the shot back down your throat. The aniseed burns your gullet, but you stifle the small sensation of throwing it back up.\n\n \n\n “Gotta go pee,” you hear Clive say. You look down on the floor, breathing deeply and just relaxing in the drunken stupor you’ve put yourself in. Your eyesight may be fuzzy, but the alcohol is numbingly soothing.\n\n \n\n “I’d take this chance to leave,” you hear someone say. You look up to see the young barmaid next to you. \n\n \n\n “Until you start a fight, I’m not gonna’ stop ya’,” she tells you, wrapping her arm around your shoulder. “But take it from someone who sees this regularly. If you try to keep up with Clive, you’ll regret it tomorrow morning.”\n\n \n\n You look up at Rhiannon, into her green eyes. Nodding, you slump down off your stool and take advantage of Clive’s absence to leave.\n\n \n “Sure, I’d like that,” you tell him.\n \n \n\n He signals to Rhiannon to bring you both another drink and, with renewed confidence, starts chatting away. \n\n \n\n You spend the next few hours with Clive. The conversation drifts from topic to topic, and as the drinks start to flow you lose sight of fishing for specific information, instead enjoying the company. \n\n \n\n As Clive keeps ordering drinks, quickly you feel tipsy. You hear yourself giggling at his jokes, a feminine titter full of sing-song. You feel your cheeks grow flushed when he compliments your figure and your features. You can’t help but notice his eyes and warm smile and how he looks at you with honest and transparent interest.\n\n \n\n “You are really beautiful,” he tells you quietly, after the third drink. His eyes wander over your body, then back to your face. “Stunning.” \n\n \n\n You feel yourself bite your lip as you look back at him. Whether it's the alcohol or something else, butterflies flutter in your stomach. \n\n \n\n Are you attracted to him?\n\n \n\n Faced with the troubling thought, you pick up your drink and down the dregs. Unfortunately, you miss the bar top when you put the glass back down and it falls off the rim, smashing on the floor.\n\n \n\n The bar patrons erupt in a collective cheer and you blush with embarrassment. Rhiannon gives you a sympathetic smile, rushing from behind the bar to clean up the shards. “Probably that’s enough for you this evening,” she says.\n\n \n\n You look from Rhiannon to Clive, who shrugs. “Lady’s got a point. You should get some rest. Been swell though. Stop by again.”\n\n \n\n Taken aback a little at Clive’s blunt attitude, you stand. He smiles, any hint of desire absent from his face. Was it the alcohol playing tricks on you? Did you imagine him hitting on you?\n\n \n\n Or is that just what you wanted?\n\n \n\n You politely return the smile and leave the bar. \n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “I think I’ve had enough,” you tell Clive. \n\n \n\n He shrugs casually, but throws you a disarming smile. “No stress. Although I’m going to order, if you don’t mind.”\n\n \n\n You spend a bit more time with Clive, as he continues to drink. You attempt to steer the conversation back to the school and about Charlton, but after a drink Clive gets increasingly philosophical. He has a theory on everything, but it’s always abstract and without more than a tip-toe in practicality. \n\n \n\n As Clive drains yet another drink, Rhiannon comes over and gently takes the glass from him. “Telling how you’ll right the wrongs of the world again, Clive?\" she asks him, winking at you.\n\n \n\n “There’s no wrongs in the world that can’t be solved through conversation,” Clive stammers, words slurred from the alcohol. “Speaking of, another drink?”\n\n \n\n Rhiannon raises an eyebrow. “You sure? I’m not calling my dad out to drive you home.” She looks at you. “Unless you’re driving him home, maybe?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head and Rhiannon giggles. \n\n \n\n Clive staggers to his feet, a touch drunk enough to find standing a challenge. “Gotta’ go pee,” he tells Rhiannon. “Be back for that drink.”\n\n \n\n He walks off, slowly. Rhiannon watches him go, shaking her head. “You won’t get much more out of that one tonight,” she tells you. “I’d take the opportunity to leave. He can charm the best into staying for just one more drink.”\n\n \n\n You nod and as Rhiannon attends to other patrons, decide to follow her advice.\n \n \n “I think I’m good for now,” you tell Clive.\n\n \n\n He shrugs. “It’s all good,” he tells you. “But I’m gonna’ have another.”\n\n \n\n Clive signals Rhiannon and she promptly delivers a replacement drink for him. He continues to drink whilst you sit and converse. \n\n \n\n He is charismatic and engaging on any topic that comes into conversation, but you find that your attempts to talk about Charlton and the school have limited success. After a drink, Clive tends to get philosophical. The world has a number of problems, and Clive has a solution for each of them.\n\n \n\n As Clive drains yet another drink, Rhiannon comes over and gently takes the glass from him. “Bringing peace to the world through words, Clive?\" she asks him, winking at you.\n\n \n\n “There’s a lot that could be solved with a little more conversation and a lot more alcohol,” Clive tells her, words starting to slur. “Speaking of, another drink?”\n\n \n\n Rhiannon sighs, but relents and starts to pour him another drink. “I’d hate to be at the Mayor’s house,” she comments, “if you’re still planning on doing his electrics tomorrow.” \n\n \n\n “Never had a job I couldn't handle,” he states, as he stands up. “Gotta’ pee. Back in a sec.”\n\n \n\n You watch him stumble off into the bathrooms, then turn and raise an eyebrow at Rhiannon. She laughs, grinning at you.\n\n \n\n “My advice. Get out whilst you still can. There’s only so many times he’ll go without just buying you one. And don’t expect me to turn away his money. Unless you’re fighting, he buys and I pour.”\n\n \n\n You nod. You hear the toilet flush from inside the men’s bathrooms. Taking Rhiannon’s words to heart, you decide you’ve had enough.\n\n \n “I think I’ve had enough,” you tell Clive. \n\n \n\n He shrugs casually, but throws you a disarming smile. “No stress. Although I’m going to order, if you don’t mind.”\n\n \n\n You spend a bit more time with Clive, as he continues to drink.

    "text": "\"Oh, I always enjoy serving you, Dan,\" you tell him, leaning over slightly and smiling. \n\n \n\n He grins and puts down a wad of notes on the payment platter. You lean over slowly and pick them up, allowing his eyes to gaze on your breasts.\n\n \n\n “Keep the change, hun,” he tells you. “And if you ever feel like serving me something more spicy, you should come see me one night in McTafeys. I’d love to get a drink with you.”\n\n \n\n You smile coyly at him and walk off, swaying your hips as you clip-clop back around the counter. He leaves shortly afterwards, flashing you a grin.\n\n \n\n When he leaves, you count the money and are shocked at the size of his tip. You consider why you encouraged him. It was just for the tip, right?\n\n \n\n Though your mind returns periodically to the encounter, and you can’t help but smile when you recall how he looked at you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You lean forward, trying to channel every ounce of charm you think Florence would have. \"Oh, Dan,\" you say, grinning too widely, \"I always enjoy... um, serving you. You’re... really good at... ordering coffee.\"\n\n \n\n Dan stops mid-count, his fingers hovering over the wad of notes as he stares at you. His brow furrows slightly, his grin faltering. \"Uh... thanks, I guess?\" he says, clearly confused.\n\n \n\n You panic and lean in closer, lowering your voice in what you think is a seductive tone but comes out more like a weird growl. \"Maybe one day... I could... pour you an extra hot coffee. Just for you.\"\n\n \n\n Dan blinks, his mouth slightly open. The silence stretches unbearably as a nearby patron coughs awkwardly. Then, Dan lets out a laugh so loud and abrupt it startles the table behind him. \"Wow, Florence, you’ve got... something, alright!\" he says, grinning but clearly not sure if you’re joking or serious.\n\n \n\n To your horror, he tosses a single coin onto the payment platter with a loud clink. \"There’s a tip for making me laugh, sweetheart,\" he says, shaking his head in disbelief. \"And hey, if you ever figure out how flirting works, come find me at McTafeys. Could use a good chuckle.\"\n\n \n\n He grabs his coffee and saunters out of the café, shaking his head and muttering, \"Extra hot coffee... unbelievable.\"\n\n \n\n When he’s gone, you glance at the payment platter to see the coin rolling to a stop. It’s not even enough to cover a full cup of coffee. You sigh, your face burning as you realize the only person you managed to impress was the one now laughing at you outside the window.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You force a polite smile, pretending not to notice his lingering gaze. “I’m glad you’re enjoying it,” you say lightly, keeping your tone neutral as you place the coffee in front of him.\n\n \n\n Dan smirks, leaning back in his chair as he rifles through his notes, clearly taking his time. “You know,” he says, glancing up at you, “a guy like me appreciates good service. Maybe even enough to show it. What do you think? Fancy earning a little extra?”\n\n \n\n You nod politely, careful not to engage further. “Every customer deserves good service,” you reply evenly, stepping back slightly to give him space.\n\n \n\n Dan chuckles, shaking his head. “Ah, you’re a professional, huh? I like that,” he says, finally slapping down a few notes on the table. You pick them up and quickly tuck them into your pocketed apron, refusing to let his words linger in the air too long.\n \n\n “Let me know if you need anything else,” you say, your tone still polite but firm enough to close the conversation. Dan gives you another long look, as though debating whether to push further, but eventually leans back with a lazy grin.\n\n \n\n “You’re a tough one, Florence,” he mutters. “I’ll crack that shell someday.”\n\n \n\n You turn and walk away, returning to the counter as he takes a sip of his coffee. Out of the corner of your eye, you see him glance at you a few more times, but he says nothing else before eventually leaving.\n\n \n\n As you begin clearing tables, you can’t help but feel a pang of irritation at the encounter. *Why does he have to be like that?* Still, you remind yourself that you handled it, and for now, that’s enough.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “Thank you,” you say politely, but nothing more. \n\n \n\n Dan gives you a quizzical look. He puts down a few notes, just enough to cover the coffee. You take the money and put it into the cash register. \n\n \n\n “What about my change?” you hear Dan say. \n\n \n\n You take a deep breath and open the till, taking out the single coin that you assumed was a tip. You walk over to his booth and place it down on the table.\n\n \n\n “Have a nice day,” you tell him. He looks at you again, but soon leaves. \n\n \n\n You return back to the trivial tasks that you’ve seen Flo do when there are no other customers. Frequently your thoughts drift to how much you dislike Dan.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n You force a smile. \"Sure, lunch sounds good.\"\n\n \n\n Dan grins, all easy confidence, like your answer was never in question. \"Smart choice,\" he says, pushing off your desk. \"It’ll be good to clear a few things up. Wouldn’t want any confusion, right?\"\n\n \n\n Right?\n\n \n\n He doesn’t wait for you to grab your things, already turning toward the door like he’s leading a meeting you never signed up for. \"Come on, let’s go. I’m starving.\"\n\n \n\n You take a steadying breath, then follow.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n You keep your expression neutral. \"No thanks. I’ve got other plans.\"\n\n \n\n For the first time, Dan’s smirk falters, just a flicker of something. Annoyance? Amusement? It’s gone before you can be sure. He straightens up, stretching like you turning him down was no big deal.\n\n \n\n \"Suit yourself.\" His voice is light, but there’s an edge to it now, something sharper beneath the easy charm. He drums his fingers on your desk, once, twice, then sighs. \"I just figured I’d give you a heads-up. Lot of errors in that system. Lot of things that could get flagged. And if they do, well…\" He spreads his hands, a picture of exaggerated helplessness.\n\n \n\n \"Gotta do my job, you know?\"\n\n \n\n He lets the words hang in the air for a moment, then flashes you a grin. \"See you around, .\"\n\n \n\n Dan strolls off, whistling, but the weight of the conversation stays behind. Something tells you that was the only invitation you were going to get - and you might end up regretting turning it down.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You sigh, deciding to at least try and steer the conversation toward something useful. “So, these problems with your calendar... what exactly are the issues?”\n\n \n\n Dan scoffs, shaking his head. “Issues? Try chaos.” He leans in, eyes narrowing. “Look, I get it. Client meetings isn’t exactly your strong suit. Not your fault, really.” He waves a hand like he’s dismissing the whole idea of women understanding his job. “But ever since you took over from Annie, it’s been one mess after another.”\n\n \n\n His fork scrapes against his plate as he gestures. “Now, Annie. Yeah, he was a secretary. Probably couldn't negiotiate a refund on a bad hair trip. But at least she knew the importance of not booking one client over the other.” He smirks, tilting his head. “You, though? Feels like every time I go to a meeting, I'm getting a call about another one I've missed. Maybe you’re just overcomplicating things. You know, thinking too hard. Women do that.”\n\n \n\n Your jaw tightens, but Dan doesn’t linger. He leans back, spreading his arms like he’s being generous. “Hey, don’t worry. I’m not mad. Just looking out for you.” His grin returns, lazy and self-assured. “See, I believe in mutual support. You scratch my back, I scratch yours.”\n\n \n\n He pauses, letting the words settle before adding, “And believe me, no one’s ever complained about my back scratching.”\n\n \n\n His smirk lingers, expectant.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You sigh, deciding to at least try and steer the conversation toward something useful. “So, these problems with the booking system… What exactly are the issues?”\n\n \n\n Dan scoffs, shaking his head. “Issues? Try chaos.” He leans in, eyes narrowing. “Look, I get it. Tech stuff isn’t exactly your… strong suit. Not your fault, really.” He waves a hand like he’s dismissing the whole idea of women being competent at computers. “But ever since you took over from Theodore, it’s been one mess after another.”\n\n \n\n His fork scrapes against his plate as he gestures. “Now, Theo. Yeah, he was a geek. Probably never touched a woman in his life. But at least he didn’t break the damn system every five minutes.” He smirks, tilting his head. “You, though? Feels like every time I log in, something else is screwed up. Maybe you’re just overcomplicating things. You know, thinking too hard. Women do that.”\n\n \n\n Your jaw tightens, but Dan doesn’t linger. He leans back, spreading his arms like he’s being generous. “Hey, don’t worry. I’m not mad. Just looking out for you.” His grin returns, lazy and self-assured. “See, I believe in mutual support. You scratch my back, I scratch yours.”\n\n \n\n He pauses, letting the words settle before adding, “And believe me, no one’s ever complained about my back scratching.”\n\n \n\n His smirk lingers, expectant.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You decide to test the waters. “What’s it like working under Mr. Thompson?”\n\n \n\n Dan snorts, shaking his head. “You think he’s the one running things?” He waves a hand dismissively. “Thompson’s a businessman. Knows how to turn a profit, sure, but he’s not exactly hands-on. Leaves most of the day-to-day to me. Knows better than to micromanage.”\n\n \n\n He leans in, lowering his voice like he’s letting you in on something juicy. “Course, he’s hands-on when he wants to be. Just ask Annie.” His smirk twists into something sharper. “Every Wednesday and Friday lunch? Private meetings. Upstairs. Here.” He takes a slow sip of his drink, watching you over the rim. “Real discreet.”\n\n \n\n You blink, processing that. But Dan’s already moving on, tone dripping with casual arrogance. “Not that she’s above a little fun, obviously. Flirts like mad, teases like she’s got all the time in the world. But she’s holding out.” He clicks his tongue, shaking his head. “It’s cute, really. Won’t last, though. They never hold out forever.”\n\n \n\n His eyes flick to you, grin widening. “I always get what I want.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You brace yourself. “So, tell me about you. What do you do outside of work?”\n\n \n\n Dan leans back, grinning like you just asked the most interesting question in the world. “Ah, now we’re talking.” He stretches, clearly enjoying the chance to brag.\n\n \n\n “I’m a busy guy, what can I say? Between keeping things running at the office and, well, my other responsibilities, there’s not much time to sit around.” He taps a finger against the table. “I coach tennis over at the country club. Lot of people don’t know that.”\n\n \n\n His smirk takes on a knowing edge. “It’s a real skill, you know. Teaching. Gotta have a personal touch. Know how to push someone just the right way. But, hey…” His eyes flick over you. “Maybe if you’re lucky, I’ll teach you a few things.”\n\n \n\n He lets that hang in the air before chuckling. “But, yeah, I stay busy. The right people come to me when they need something done. It’s a good position to be in.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You switch gears. “You grew up in Charlton, right? What was school like?”\n\n \n\n Dan exhales like you’ve just asked him to reminisce about his glory days. “Oh, man. Charlton Upper. What a time.” He leans back, shaking his head with a grin, clearly savoring the memory.\n\n \n\n “I was kind of a big deal back then. Tennis prodigy, you know? Had a natural gift. Coach said I could’ve gone pro if I wanted to.” He smirks. “Didn’t even have to try that hard. Some people are just built for this stuff.”\n\n \n\n He pauses just long enough to let you picture the trophies that almost certainly don’t exist. “Everyone knew my name. I had the whole school wrapped around my finger. Teachers, students… the girls especially.”\n\n \n\n Dan chuckles, shaking his head like he’s letting you in on a secret. “See, school’s like anything else. Some people struggle, work their asses off, and still get nowhere. And then there’s guys like me. Born to win.”\n\n \n\n He picks up his drink, flashing you that knowing grin. “Bet you can guess which side I was on.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You force a polite smile, nodding as if you’re taking in his wisdom. “You’re probably right. It’s good to have someone looking out for me.”\n\n \n\n Dan’s smirk widens, clearly pleased with himself. He leans back in his chair, like he’s just done you a huge favor. “See? Knew you were smart. It’s about knowing who to listen to.”\n\n \n\n He checks his watch. “Alright, we should head back. Wouldn’t want to take too long, right? People might talk. And they'd be wrong. For once.” His tone is light, but there’s something underneath it. A reminder that your cooperation doesn’t go unnoticed.\n\n \n \n As you stand up, he moves past you, his hand brushing against your backside in a way that’s too casual to be an accident, too light to be called out. A pat, nothing more, but enough to make your skin crawl.\n\n \n\n He grins, utterly unbothered. “You’ll see the benefits soon enough.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You keep your expression neutral, but you don’t play along. “I’m sure I’ll figure things out,” you say, pushing your plate away.\n\n \n\n Dan’s smirk twitches, his amusement dimming just a little. He lets out a low chuckle, shaking his head. “Suit yourself. Some people just have to learn the hard way.”\n\n \n\n He sets his fork down with deliberate care, grabbing his napkin and tossing it onto his plate. When he looks back at you, the warmth in his voice is gone, replaced with something sharper. “Alright, let’s get back. No point wasting time here.”\n\n \n\n He stands, stretching like this was all just another business meeting. But before he turns to leave, he gives you one last look, a slow, assessing glance. “You’ll see soon enough.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Almost like an out-of-body experience, you feel yourself moving next to Dan, dropping to your knees. The porcelain bathroom tiles feeling cold on your knees. \n\n \n\n Your eyes are inches away from his balls, hanging out from his trouser flies. He lets his hand drop away, grinning down at you, waiting for you to act.\n\n \n\n The flirting, the encouraging, the continual deflection. Part of you knew that Dan wouldn’t settle for just words. Yet even when he was at his most insistent, you could have said no. Looking forward, at the rapidly stiffening cock a hair’s width away from your face, you realise - you chose to be here. On your knees. In the men’s toilets. With the sleazy salesman’s prick dangling in front of you.\n\n \n\n “Come on,” Dan says, meeting your eyes as he looks down. “Close this deal.”\n\n \n\n It’s enough to spur you into action. You reach up, cupping his balls in your tiny hand. You feel a smile forming on your face, and for once you can’t tell if you’re still playing the part of a slutty secretary, or this is really just you.\n\n \n\n “It’s so big,” you lie, before you wrap your lips around the tip of Dan’s hard dick.\n\n \n\n You hear him chuckle, as you begin to bob back and forth on the tip. The salty taste from his semen fills your senses. Endorphins rush through your body, as you pump his shaft and feed more and more of Dan between your lips and into your mouth.\n\n \n\n Your eyes glance over to the side, momentarily noticing the urinal built into the wall. Something is jarring. As if you are trying to recall a time where you once used this room for entirely different reasons. But try as you might, you can’t quite picture what seems to be on the edge of your thoughts. This room. The men’s toilets. Now the only reason you should be in here is for this.\n\n \n\n “Oh boy,” Dan murmurs, almost stammering. “You’ve got some skills, love.”\n\n \n\n Looking up at him, you almost smile as what seems like a compliment. You meet his eyes, as you move back and forward, taking his prick into your mouth, feeling the hard floor against your legs. You don’t resist when his hands move behind your head, his fingers intertwining in your hair, and Dan takes control.\n\n \n\n Still looking down at you, Dan pushes your head further and further into his groin, forcing his cock deeper into your mouth. You strain to breathe, trying to hold back a gag reflex that you didn’t even know you had. \n\n \n\n As Dan begins to pant, you feel his grip on your hair tighten. Pulling your locks roughly from your scalp. And all the while, his cock passes between your lips, and hits the back of your throat with force.\n\n \n\n Then, only a minute or two after beginning, Dan arches his head back and clamps his hands around your head, pushing you forward into his pubic hair. And you feel the jets of cum hit the back of your throat.\n\n \n\n Your body convulses. It takes all your efforts not to retch. But, still forced to stare up and meet his eyes, you gulp. Feeling the thick slimy juice crawl down inside your body.\n\n \n\n A moment of silence. Dan’s grip eases. He smiles. Pulls his prick out of your mouth. And you close your lips around it, wiping it clean of semen. You lick your lips, swallow again, then - without thinking - smile up at him.\n\n \n\n Dan straightens, adjusting his jacket like nothing happened. “Told you it’d be quick,” he says with a wink. “We should do it proper sometime. Maybe after hours.”\n\n \n\n He’s out the door before you can say anything.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You stay behind for a second, staring at the sink. The mirror. Your reflection stares back.\n\n \n\n Same face. Same job. But something feels... shifted. Like you’ve dropped something important, and you can’t quite figure out what. You splash water on your face. Dry it quickly. Then straighten your skirt and walk back out.\n\n \n\n Reception is quiet. For now. The phones aren’t ringing. The inbox isn’t screaming. You still have time. Time to catch up. Time to look productive. You sit down. Start typing.\n\n \n\n You’re good at this. Efficient. Focused.\n\n \n\n You don’t feel proud. Or ashamed. Not yet.\n\n \n\n Just… off. Like something’s not quite where it used to be.\n\n \n\n But the work gets done.\n\n \n\n And that, at least, feels normal.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n Before you can stop yourself, your voice lifts into a bright, sugary tone.\n\n \n\n “Oh, Dan… I bet you’d fix the whole system yourself if they let you.”\n\n \n\n You tilt your head just slightly, fingers brushing the edge of the desk. Your smile lands somewhere between helpless and adoring.\n\n \n\n Dan straightens, practically preening. “Yeah, well. Someone’s gotta keep this place running. I swear, half the time I feel like I’m the only adult in the building.”\n\n \n\n You giggle and hate the sound of it the second it leaves your mouth.\n\n \n\n “I just think it’s amazing, how you keep things together,\" you continue, almost listening to the words coming out like they were new to you. \"Maybe Thompson needs to be reminded who his real MVP is?”\n\n \n\n He smirks. “You know what? Maybe he does.”\n\n \n\n “And remind him that even star players need their support staff,” you add sweetly. “Like .”\n\n \n\n Dan mulls this over, then flashes you a grin. \"Phillips?\" he says. \"You reckon they'd come back?\"\n\n \n\n You nod. \"I think it would help.\"\n\n \n\n He considers you, then leans in, his eyes wandering over your body. \"It would give me more time to spend on... other things.\"\n\n \n\n Without a moment's hesitation, you smile coyly. \"I'd be ever-so grateful.\"\n\n \n \n His teeth flash at you, as he gently pats your hand with his. “If it means so much to you, I’ll drop something into Thompson's ear,\" he whispers. \"You'd owe me, but I'm sure you can think of something you can do to make it up to me.\"\n\n \n\n You feel your face smile back at him. He massages your fingers with his, then stands and strolls off, entirely too pleased with himself.\n \n\n You stay seated, the smile slowly fading from your face. It worked. He bought it.\n\n \n\n But the tone and body language came out so easily. Too easily.\n\n \n\n *And didn't you enjoy his touch?*\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You force yourself to smile. And not the polite receptionist smile. This is something warmer and sweet.\n\n \n\n “I don’t know how you do it, Dan. Honestly. Half this place would fall apart without you.”\n\n \n\n He raises an eyebrow, pausing mid-rant. “Yeah? You noticing, Annie?”\n\n \n\n You nod, eyes holding his. “It’s hard not to.”\n\n \n\n That does it. He straightens, smoothing down his shirt like he’s on a date.\n\n \n\n “Well,” he says, flashing a grin, “someone’s gotta take control when the rest of them are chasing their tails.”\n\n \n\n You let out a laugh, just shy of a giggle. You hate how real it sounds. But you continue. “You should get some support, though. You're so busy, I hardly ever see you.\"\n\n \n\n His eyes wander over your clothes. \"I'd always make time for you, Annie. Even if it's just a quickie.\"\n\n \n\n Burying the feeling of sickness, you force a smile. \"Maybe if came back, you’d have more time for… the important things.”\n\n \n\n He tilts his head, mock-thoughtful. “You think they'd come back?”\n\n \n\n “I think,” you say carefully, “if someone with your… influence had a word, it might help.”\n\n \n\n Dan smiles, all teeth. “Alright. I'll say something.\"\n\n \n \n He stands and steps back with a wink. “Not just a pretty face after all, huh?\" His eyes glance down to your legs. \"Amongst other things.\"\n \n \n\n He walks off, smug and satisfied. You exhale, your posture relaxing the moment he’s gone. You played the part and it worked. But nevertheless you feel something oily clinging to your skin.\n\n \n\n If you’re going to flirt to survive… how many more times will you need to?\n\n \n\n And is it really just playing a part anymore?\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You try a smile. Not too much. Just enough.\n\n \n\n “Dan,” you say, tone lighter than you feel. “You always seem to keep things together around here. Honestly, I don’t know how you do it.”\n\n \n\n He stops, narrows his eyes. “Annie,” he says slowly, “are you trying to butter me up?”\n\n \n\n You blink. “Just saying what everyone’s thinking.”\n\n \n\n He tilts his head, unimpressed. “Right.”\n\n \n\n A pause. Then he sighs, and the moment crumples in your hands. “You're gonna have to give me a bit more than that, love. Words might work for customers, but I expect to get a little more action.\"\n\n \n\n His eyes linger on your breasts, then he looks back up to you. “Anyway,” he says, stepping back, “I’ve got a system to unbreak and a manager to report to.”\n\n \n\n He flashes a grin. “Better luck next time, sweetheart.”\n\n \n\n And then he’s gone, leaving you at the desk, the warmth from shame on your face.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You straighten in the chair, spine tall. “Dan,” you say, voice firm. “You’re right. The system’s a mess. But this isn’t just about Theodore.”\n\n \n\n That catches him. He stops pacing. You press on.\n\n \n\n “You said it yourself, knew how to keep everything on track. You think I don’t miss that? You think the customers don’t?”\n\n \n\n Dan narrows his eyes, arms folding. He’s listening now.\n\n \n\n “Then do something about it,” you continue. “Thompson listens to you. You walk into his office and say Phillips should come back. That carries weight.”\n\n \n\n Dan looks at you, then grins. \"Girl's got some teeth. I bet you could put them to good use.\"\n\n \n\n “I’m serious,” you shoot back, refusing to play along. \"Thompson needs results. And you need people around you who know what they’re doing.”\n\n \n\n You meet his gaze, unblinking. “I’m not asking for a favour. I’m asking you to fix something that’s broken. You're good at that, right?\"\n\n \n\n Dan pauses, jaw working slightly. Then he nods. “Alright. Sheesh. If it means so much to you, I’ll say something. Can’t promise anything, but I’ll put it on his radar.”\n\n \n\n He stands and steps back, looking at you differently now. “Not bad, Annie. Maybe there’s more to you than... the obvious.”\n\n \n\n He walks off, already muttering about pipeline delays. You exhale slowly, the adrenaline fading. It worked.\n\n \n\n *And you didn't have to lose yourself to survive here, after all.*\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You square your shoulders, trying to match Dan’s energy. “Look,” you say, keeping your voice steady, “if you really think was valuable, then maybe tell Thompson. You said it yourself. They held this place together.”\n\n \n\n Dan raises an eyebrow, unimpressed. “Annie,” he says, dryly. “You trying to run the company now?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “No. I’m just saying --”\n\n \n\n He cuts you off. “You’re just saying something that isn’t your business.”\n\n \n\n He steps in slightly, tone softening but not kindly. “Look, I know you like playing boss when you’re behind that desk, but maybe leave the strategy talk to the grown-ups.”\n\n \n\n You freeze, lips parting but with nothing to follow. Dan sighs and turns, already heading toward the office. “I’ll deal with it myself,” he mutters. “The last thing I need is advice from someone who files highlighters alphabetically.”\n\n \n\n The door swings shut behind him. You stay seated, staring at your screen, cheeks burning. You tried. You really did.\n\n \n\n But here? That doesn’t always count for much.\n\n \n\n *Not when you look like Annie.*\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You offer a small shrug. Nothing more.\n\n \n\n Dan watches you for a beat, expecting a response. When it doesn’t come, he leans back in the chair, arms stretched out like he owns the whole front desk. “Nothing to say?” he muses. “That’s alright. Pretty girls don’t need interesting opinions. Just enough lip gloss to look interesting.”\n\n \n\n You manage a faint smile, but say nothing. He chuckles, as if amused by his own generosity.\n\n \n\n “See, this is what I like about you, Annie. You don’t get in the way. Just smile, answer the phones, and let the grown-ups fix the mess.”\n\n \n\n He pushes up from the chair with a groan. “Suppose I’ll take it to Thompson myself. Theodore needs a scolding.”\n\n \n\n You nod faintly, and he winks before heading off down the hall.\n\n \n\n The moment lingers. You’re still seated, still silent.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You don’t even think. Before you’ve finished processing what Dan just said, your lips part into a soft, obliging smile.\n\n \n\n “Oh, Dan,” you purr gently. “You work so hard… no wonder the system can’t keep up with you.”\n\n \n\n You say it as you slowly stand, smoothing down your skirt. The movement isn’t deliberate, but it’s precise. Measured. Like your body remembers how Annie handles this sort of man, even if your brain hasn't caught up.\n\n \n\n Dan pauses mid-rant, eyes flicking down to your skirt. He smirks. “Well. You’re not wrong.”\n\n \n\n You lean back a little on the desk, voice syrupy. “Maybe now’s not the best time to vent to Thompson. You wouldn’t want him thinking you can’t handle a little tech hiccup.”\n\n \n\n Dan chuckles, pleased. “C’mon, he knows I run the damn place.”\n\n \n\n “Exactly,” you say, batting your lashes. “And besides… I’m sure didn’t mean to break anything. You wouldn’t want to get them in trouble over a few bugs, would you?”\n\n \n\n Dan tilts his head, clearly enjoying this. “You sticking up for Phillips now?”\n\n \n\n You smile, wide and innocent. “You’re clever enough to fix the problem. And I’m sure there’s better ways to spend your lunch break than with a stuffy old man.”\n\n \n\n He grins at that. “Stuffy old man? Careful Annie, you wouldn't want to get into trouble.\"\n\n \n\n \"Oh, you wouldn't tell on me,\" you say coyly. \"I'm sure we could keep this between us.\"\n\n \n\n He winks. “But I’ll remember you owe me one, sweetheart.”\n\n \n\n You nod, still smiling, and watch as he strolls off with his usual swagger.\n\n \n\n Your cheeks ache from holding the smile. Only when the door swings shut does your posture drop. But the smile clings to your face like residue. Only now do you consider the words that came without you thinking.\n\n \n\n And part of you wonders what Dan will expect for keeping this between you and him.\n\n \n\n Don't you mean Annie?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You pause, then let out a soft laugh. Not too much. Just enough.\n\n \n\n “Come on, Dan,” you say, leaning your elbows gently on the desk as you look up to him. “You don’t want to waste your whole lunch hour talking about bugs and quotes.”\n\n \n\n His attention sharpens. “Oh yeah? That a better offer?”\n\n \n\n You hold his gaze, lips curved just slightly. “Just… a suggestion. Spend a bit more time relaxing. Less time yelling at Thompson.”\n\n \n\n Dan grins, basking in it. “Relaxing, huh? That your medical advice, Annie?”\n\n \n\n “I just think you work too hard,” you say sweetly. “You don’t need to be sorting out other people’s problems. Especially not when you’ve got people like me to help keep things running smooth.”\n\n \n\n He tilts his head, openly appreciative. “Well damn. If I knew I’d get this kind of service, I’d have been complaining more often.”\n\n \n\n You push past the discomfort in your gut and smile wider. “Maybe keep that between us. I wouldn’t want everyone coming to me for a therapy session.\"\n\n \n\n Dan chuckles low in his throat. \"I was thinking more nurse than therapist. Tight little uniform, clipboard, checking me over… yeah, I think you’d make recovery worth it.\"\n\n \n\n You hold your smile, feeling sick inside your stomach.\n\n \n\n He laughs again. \"Alright, Annie. I’ll keep it quiet. And maybe I’ll keep Phillips out of any chats with Thompson too… for now.”\n\n \n\n He shoots you a wink and strolls out of the building, self-satisfied and humming to himself.\n\n \n\n You stay frozen a moment longer, then sink slowly back into your chair. The feeling inside of you refusing to go away. Dan won't be talking to Thompson this lunchtime, but your mind races back to the words you said to keep him away.\n\n \n\n And you chose those words, too.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You hesitate. Then, unsure why, you lean forward slightly, letting your hair fall just a bit to the side.\n\n \n\n “I mean… you make it look so easy,” you say, voice soft but wavering. “Keeping the place together. Maybe Thompson should be… thanking you, not hearing complaints.”\n\n \n\n Dan glances at you. One brow lifts, but he doesn’t grin. “Thompson does thank me. Every Friday. It's called a paycheck.”\n\n \n\n The air between you cools. You force a small laugh, but it lands dead. Dan rubs his temple and stands.\n\n \n\n “Anyway. If Phillips can’t be bothered to show up, I’ll bring it up. Thompson should hear it from someone who actually puts in the hard graft.”\n\n \n\n He strolls off without another word towards the office. Towards where Thompson is.\n\n \n\n You sit there, the blood draining from your face. You didn’t say anything outrageous, but it didn’t land. You can't imagine what Dan is now telling the boss.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You fold your hands neatly on the desk, letting your voice come out clear and even. “Dan, wait.”\n\n \n\n He pauses, halfway to the corridor. “Yeah?”\n\n \n\n “You’re right. The system’s a mess. But isn’t the reason your pipeline’s broken today.”\n\n \n\n Dan turns fully, one eyebrow raised. You press on.\n\n \n \n \"It was a mess long before . If you storm into Thompson’s office right now, you’re not going to look like a team player. You’ll just look like you can’t solve the problem yourself.”\n\n \n\n There’s a pause. Dan narrows his eyes, weighing your words. \"You think I can't sort things out without help?\"\n\n \n\n Seizing his insecurity, you press on. \"I'm just saying that a man - a real man - wouldn't complain to the boss. They'd find a way to make the deal without it. You're a real man, aren't you Dan?\"\n\n \n\n Dan huffs, holding your eyes. \"Of course.\"\n\n \n\n \"Then hold off,\" you add. \"Least for today.\"\n \n\n Dan scratches his chin as he thinks. \"Good point, love. I don't need a nerd to help me sell deals.\"\n\n \n\n He pivots and saunters out, still muttering about half-wits and calendar bugs. But not heading toward Thompson’s office. You let out a quiet breath.\n\n \n\n That worked. And you didn’t have to play dumb or sweet. Just smart.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You take a breath and step out from behind the desk. “Dan, wait. Maybe now’s not the right time to bring this up with Thompson.”\n\n \n\n He pauses mid-stride, blinking at you. “No?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “It’s just… the system’s been unpredictable lately. It’s not really 's fault, and storming into Thompson’s office might just make things worse.”\n\n \n\n Dan stares, unimpressed. “Worse than missing client info and broken links? Because that’s where we’re at.”\n\n \n\n You press on. “I’m just saying maybe we keep this internal for now. Handle it like a team.”\n\n \n\n His face twists into a grin that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Cute speech, Annie. But there's no team in sales. Real men don't make excuses. And I don’t babysit screwups. Babysitting is more your bag, isn't it?”\n\n \n\n He adjusts his sunglasses again and turns back toward the entrance. “If you want to play office politics, I'm sure Clive has a long-winded opinion. Meanwhile, I’ll be with Thompson. He listens to winners.”\n\n \n\n You watch him disappear down the corridor, your throat tight. You tried. But now all you can do is sit back and hope Dan doesn’t tank you while he chats to Thompson.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You offer a small shrug. Nothing more.\n\n \n\n Dan watches you for a beat, expecting a response.

Before you’ve finished processing what Dan just said, your lips part into a soft, obliging smile.\n\n \n\n “Oh, Dan,” you purr gently. “You work so hard… maybe your calendar just can't keep up with how fast you're moving.”\n\n \n\n You say it as you slowly stand, smoothing down your skirt. The movement isn’t deliberate, but it’s precise. Measured. Like your body remembers how Annie handles this sort of man, even if your brain hasn't caught up.\n\n \n\n Dan pauses mid-rant, eyes flicking down to your skirt. He smirks. “Well.

That a better offer?”\n\n \n\n You hold his gaze, lips curved just slightly. “Just… a suggestion. Spend a bit more time relaxing.

You can't imagine what Dan is now telling Thompson.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You fold your hands neatly on the desk, letting your voice come out clear and even. “Dan, wait.”\n\n \n\n He pauses, halfway to the corridor. “Yeah?”\n\n \n\n “You’re right. Your calendar is a mess. But isn’t the reason it's messed up.”\n\n \n\n Dan turns fully, one eyebrow raised. You press on.\n\n \n \n \"It was broken long before . If you storm into Thompson’s office right now, you’re not going to look like a team player. You’ll just look like you can’t solve the problem yourself.”\n\n \n\n There’s a pause. Dan narrows his eyes, weighing your words. \"You think I can't sort things out without help?\"\n\n \n\n Seizing his insecurity, you press on. \"I'm just saying that a man - a real man - wouldn't complain to the boss. They'd find a way to get to their meetings regardless. You're a real man, aren't you Dan?\"\n\n \n\n Dan huffs, holding your eyes. \"Of course.\"\n\n \n\n \"Then hold off,\" you add. \"Least for today.\"\n \n\n Dan scratches his chin as he thinks. \"Good point, love. I don't need a secretary to help me close.\"\n\n \n\n He pivots and saunters out, still muttering about half-wits and calendar bugs. But not heading toward Thompson’s door. You let out a quiet breath.\n\n \n\n That worked. And you didn’t have to play dumb or sweet. Just smart.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You take a breath and step out from behind the desk. “Dan, wait. Maybe now’s not the right time to bring this up with Thompson.”\n\n \n\n He pauses mid-stride, blinking at you. “No?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “It’s just… the system’s been unpredictable lately. It’s not really 's fault, and storming into Thompson’s office might just make things worse.”\n\n \n\n Dan stares, unimpressed. “Worse than missing wrong addresses and missed meetings? Because that’s where we’re at.”\n\n \n\n You press on. “I’m just saying maybe we keep this internal for now. Handle it like a team.”\n\n \n\n His face twists into a grin that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Cute speech, Annie. But there's no team in sales. Real men don't make excuses. And I don’t babysit screwups. Babysitting is more your bag, isn't it?”\n\n \n\n He adjusts his sunglasses again and turns back toward the entrance. “If you want to play office politics, I'm sure Clive has a long-winded opinion. Meanwhile, I’ll be with Thompson. He listens to winners.”\n\n \n\n He strides forward and opens the door. \"Got a moment, boss?\" you hear him say as he steps in.\n\n \n\n You tried. But now all you can do is sit back and hope Dan doesn’t tank you while he chats to Thompson.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You offer a small shrug. Nothing more.\n\n \n\n Dan doesn't stop. He continues walking towards Thompson's office, reaching forward to turn the door handle and open the door. \"Got a moment, boss?\" you hear him say as he steps in.\n\n \n\n The door shuts behind you. You try to overhear the conversation, but the voices are muted behind the sturdy wood.\n\n \n\n You sigh. All you can do is sit back and hope Dan doesn’t tank you while he chats to Thompson.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <>",

    "text": "“Mrs. DeBussy,” you begin, measured and respectful. “I need access to Terrence Handle’s locker.”\n\n \n\n She turns to you, eyes blinking quickly in confusion and then sharpening with interest. “Emily, darling. That’s a rather... unusual request, don’t you think?”\n\n \n\n You keep your expression level. “I have reason to believe he may be in possession of something inappropriate. Something that contradicts the standards we hold here at Charlton.”\n\n \n\n Her smile tightens into that familiar, thin line. “You’re suggesting… contraband?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “Yes. Something in his biology notebook. I think it could be worth investigating. I thought it best to come to you before it became more… public.”\n\n \n\n DeBussy tuts softly, as if the very notion has already inconvenienced her. “Normally, I’d have to speak to Headmaster Stitch. Locker searches are not typically within my remit.” Her voice rises slightly, just enough for the rest of the club to overhear.\n\n \n\n You lean in, tone hushed. “This is sensitive. And time-sensitive. If there’s something in that book, I need to see it before he hides it or destroys it. I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t think it was important.”\n\n \n\n She considers you for a long moment, then sighs in that dramatic, theatrical way she reserves for self-congratulation. “Very well. You’ve been a tremendous help to the club. And I suppose, as President, a certain... discretion must be afforded.”\n\n \n\n From beneath her desk drawer, she retrieves a small brass key, dangling it in front of you for a beat too long.\n\n \n\n “Straight there and back. And I expect a full report on what you find.” Her smile returns to its usual sugary position, still soured at the edges. “It’s such a delight when our brightest girls take initiative.”\n\n \n\n You take the key, pocketing it with a nod. “You’ll have your report.”\n\n \n\n “See that I do, dear,” she says, already scribbling in her notebook again.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n “Can you tell me a little bit about the lessons you teach here?” you ask DeBussy.\n\n \n\n At the words her face lights up, eyes bright behind her glasses. “Oh, I’m so glad you asked,” she says, holding her clipboard a little closer to her chest.\n\n \n\n She steps forward with a kind of deliberate elegance, her voice lowered to a confidential tone. “Ballet is one of the finest tools a young woman can possess. It teaches posture, discipline, control. But more than that, it teaches presence. The ability to command attention without needing to raise one’s voice.”\n\n \n\n She pauses to let the words settle, smile unwavering. “Of course, it requires commitment. You have to be willing to be seen. If you’re hiding at the edges, or pretending not to notice the way the world watches. Well, you’ll never truly benefit.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes narrow, as you struggle to comprehend. “Are you saying that you teach women how to be watched?”\n\n \n\n \n She turns her attention fully to you now, her smile softening. “Come now, dear. We all have sharp eyes. We are watched, whether we like it or not. That is the natural way of things. The trick is, how to convey what you want through it. That is what I teach.”\n\n \n\n DeBussy eyes you carefully, reasserting her smile. “I do think you’d take well to it,” she says. “You’ve a thoughtful way of carrying yourself. That can be shaped. Refined.”\n\n \n\n She leans in, lowering her voice and whispering conspiratorially. “There’s strength in grace, you know. Ballet teaches you to hold space. To own it. To shape the way others look at you. And to enjoy being looked at.”\n\n \n\n She winks, then lets out a gentle laugh. “And in Charlton, that’s a rather valuable skill.”\n\n \n DeBussy’s tone shifts slightly, still pleasant but now marked by irritation. “I’m always pleased when a gentleman takes an interest. Though I’m not surprised that the subtleties of what's taught here are lost on you.”\n\n \n\n She takes a deep breath and reinforces her smile. “Boxing, football, cricket. All excellent for a young man’s frame. You’ll need that strength, after all. But for a lady?” She shakes her head with a smile. “No. Ballet is better. It cultivates poise, balance, grace. It is ideal for women who keep one eye always on their waistline. Which is the vast majority of us, I must say.”\n\n \n\n “You see,” she continues. “Girls are judged not by their strength, but by how well they move through a room. Whether they draw the right kind of attention. That is a natural fact.”\n\n \n\n Her voice lowers, just slightly. “Being watched is part of growing up. Best to learn how to enjoy it. With grace, of course.”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You take a breath. “Alright. I’d like to join the lesson.”\n\n \n\n \n DeBussy’s smile widens with unmistakable satisfaction. “I’m so pleased to hear that, my dear. Very wise. I take it you're a member here?”\n\n \n\n \n \n You nod. “Yes.”\n\n \n\n DeBussy gleams with joy. \"Lovely! And you've brought suitable clothes with you?”\n \n \n\n \n \n You nod again. She lets out a small giggle. \"I'm sure you look wonderful in them, dear. Now. Spit spot. Off to the locker room. The other young ladies will be here shortly. I’ll be issuing ballet shoes if you need them once everyone’s present.”\n\n \n\n Her tone is cheerful, efficient. As she returns to jotting notes on her clipboard, it becomes clear that conversation is over.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You give her a look. “Don’t you have anything spare?”\n\n \n\n She winces, trying to retain her smile. \"I'm afraid I don't,\" she tells you. \"But I can recommend the selection in Evans. There's a beautiful pink outfit that would look super on you.\"\n\n \n\n She looks down at her clipboard briefly. \"Come back when you've brought your clothes, dear. I'm here every weekend.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You shake your head. “Do I have to be?”\n\n \n\n DeBussy presses her lips together, but nods. \"I'm afraid so, but don't get disheartened, dear. Just have a chat with Mr. Holloway. He'll sign you up in a jiffy.\"\n\n \n\n She offers you a wide smile, nodding towards Casey.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n DeBussy’s smile widens with unmistakable satisfaction. “I’m so pleased to hear that, my dear. Very wise.”\n\n \n\n She gestures lightly with her clipboard. “Spit spot. Off to the locker room. The other young ladies will be here shortly. I’ll be issuing ballet shoes if you need them once everyone’s present.”\n\n \n\n Her tone is cheerful, efficient. As she returns to jotting notes on her clipboard, it becomes clear that the conversation is over. You’re expected to go get changed.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n DeBussy’s smile widens with unmistakable satisfaction. “I’m so pleased to hear that, my dear. Very wise. I take it you're a member here?”\n\n \n\n You aren’t sure the answer to that, so you instead shrug. “Do I have to be?” \n\n \n\n DeBussy presses her lips together, but nods. \"I'm afraid so, but don't get disheartened, dear. Just have a chat with Mr. Holloway. He'll sign you up in a jiffy.\"\n\n \n\n She offers you a wide smile, nodding towards Casey. You grimace, unsure of how in this form you could even sign up for a gym membership. If you want to sign up for the gym, you’ll need to be in a form you at least can pay legitimately for. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "“Dennis,” you begin. “I want to apologise. I haven’t been nice to you.”\n\n \n\n “What do you want, Emily?” he says, not looking up at you.\n\n \n\n “I just wanted to say that I think I was mean to you because I actually like you,” you continue. “I think I got carried away.”\n\n \n\n He looks up at you, then looks back to what he’s doing. “You are making fun of me.”\n\n \n\n You realise you’re going to have to do more than speak to him. You step towards him, cautiously stroking his arm. “No, I mean it. I like intelligent guys.”\n\n \n\n His eyes flick between your face and your hand on his arm. You catch him even looking at your breasts. He gulps. “I don’t believe you.”\n\n \n\n You look at him, feeling his conflict. You know you’re going to have to give a final push to get him over the line. \n\n \n\n Grasping his hand gently, you move it around your waist and against your skirt. “Would I do this if I wasn’t serious?” \n\n \n\n You jump a little as you feel his hands clasp your bum, giving it a gentle pinch. His hand darts back and he refuses to meet your eyes with his, but you see a little smile on his face as he returns to what he was doing.\n\n \n\n The faint sting of his pinch lingers below your skirt. You know you have won him back over, but more pressing is that the sensation of that sting has brought a smile to your own face.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You clear your throat, glancing nervously at Dennis. \"Uh, hey, Dennis,\" you start, your voice a little too high-pitched. \"You’re, um... good with all this AV stuff. It’s... impressive.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis doesn’t look up, his attention fixed on the camera. \"Thanks,\" he says flatly. \"What do you need? Is something broken?\"\n\n \n\n \"No, no, nothing’s broken,\" you say quickly, shifting awkwardly from foot to foot. \"I just thought, you know... maybe we could, uh... talk? Or something.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis glances at you briefly, frowning. \"Talk? About what? You need help setting up a projector or something?\"\n\n \n\n You force a laugh, your cheeks burning. \"No, I mean... I think it’s really cool how, uh, knowledgeable you are. About... cables. And stuff.\"\n\n \n\n He pauses, his brow furrowing in confusion.\n\n \n\n You nod, fumbling for words. \"Yeah, well, I guess I just... think you’re, you know... smart. And, um... interesting.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis blinks at you, then shrugs. \"Cool. Thanks.\" He turns back to what he was doing. \"Anyway, I’m kinda busy, so if you need something specific, just let me know.\"\n\n \n\n You stand there for a moment, unsure whether to laugh or cry. Finally, you mutter a quick \"never mind\" and retreat, Dennis already lost in his work. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I’ve been wondering,” you begin. “How are the boys' lessons different to the girls? You know what they teach us in biology. How is that different to your lessons?”\n\n \n\n His face reddens at the topic and you notice he increasingly avoids making eye contact with you.\n\n \n\n “It’s the same in biology,” he stammers. “We watch the video tapes like you do. Except… It's rowdy. Loud. It’s like a zoo.” You notice he spits a little as he says the last sentence.\n\n \n\n “And other lessons? Geography?” \n\n \n\n He looks up at you, a little more relaxed in talking with you. “Geography is all about the places men have conquered. All the things to do. I usually write about Japan. I’d love to go there.”\n\n \n\n Dennis titters a little. “Mr. Stitch doesn’t like girls attending boys' lessons,” he tells you. “The only way you could would be to get a pass from a teacher. And I don’t think it would be safe for you, even if you did.”\n\n \n\n “And Stitch doesn’t let just anyone have a pass,” he adds, a little bit of frustration seeping into his voice. “I've only got one to help out with the AV equipment. Usually they’re just for those who get extra lessons from Stitch.”\n\n \n\n “Extra lessons?” you ask.\n\n \n\n Dennis' face bunches up with anger. “Yeah. Supposed to be for people at the top of their classes. But it’s like you get to the top by just having those lessons. I have to work hard to be there.\"\n\n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “What do you think about the school”, you ask him directly.\n\n \n\n “I can’t wait to leave,” he blurts out. As he says the words you can see fear on his face. He looks at you, eyes widened. \n\n \n\n You offer him a reassuring smile. “It’s okay. It’s a bit strange here.”\n\n \n\n He smiles meekly, relaxing. “I hate it. The boys here are bullies. All they care about are their dumb football games and impressing girls. The teachers are just as bad too. They call it Social Darwinism. It’s just a way to control us.”\n\n \n\n “Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He looks at you, his lips pursed. “You shouldn’t be asking that. It will get you in trouble.”\n\n <> \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Hey, can I ask you something?” you begin. “About Biology class.”\n\n \n\n Dennis keeps his attention on what he’s doing, not looking at you. “What about it?”, he stammers.\n\n \n\n “The documentaries seem very strange,” you reply. “Where do they come from?”\n\n \n\n Dennis looks up, his face redder than usual. “I don’t know. They’ve always been here.” He flicks his eyes to the floor.\n\n \n\n “Why do you help out with the lessons?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “I’m in the school AV club,” he says, with a hint of embarrassment in his voice. “I *am* the school AV club, actually. Mr. Stitch lets me watch whatever I want, as long as I fix things when they break and I keep the cassette cupboard neat and tidy. He hates it when things are untidy.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “So you keep all the equipment and cassettes in that cupboard?” you say, nodding your head to the closed door at the back of the room.\n\n \n\n He nods, almost smiling at the topic. “Yeah. I’m the only one with the key. Well, except staff. And Olaf. The janitor. Mr. Stitch doesn’t like people to have access to the tapes. He says that some of them should only be watched with adult supervision.” He blushes. “Except he lets me.”\n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I couldn’t borrow the key to the AV cupboard, could I?” you ask him. “I’d love to see some of the tapes in there.”\n\n \n\n He looks at you, a small twitch in the corner of his mouth. “Do you like old movies too?”\n\n \n\n You nod, placating him. “I’d love to see what’s in the library. Do you think I could have a peek?”\n\n \n\n He grimaces. “I don’t think I can do that. If Mr. Stitch found out, I’d get in a lot of trouble. But…”\n\n \n\n \n \n Dennis pauses, looking at you. “I could tell you all about them, if you like,” he stammers. “I could meet you at Fresh Pot one evening. I could buy you a coffee. Maybe even afterwards we could pick out a movie to watch together.”\n\n \n\n His lip is quivering slightly once he stops talking. It takes a moment for you to register what is happening here. *He is asking you out on a date.*\n\n \n\n Your mind races. Whilst you may look like Emily, this would be you, going out on a date. But it would get you closer to Dennis, and the key to the AV cupboard.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n Dennis shifts his weight from foot to foot. “I… could lend you it. After we got that coffee.”\n\n \n\n He won’t quite meet your eyes as you stare back at him. “You’d give me the key if I met you at Fresh Pot?”\n\n \n\n Dennis nods, repeatedly. “Yes! I could definitely do that!” He sniffs. “I’ll see you at Fresh Pot, yeah?”\n\n \n\n You sigh. It seems that Dennis really wants a date with Emily.\n\n \n\n Actions\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n Dennis gives a small, pleased smile. “Okay. For you, sure. Just to have a peek, okay?\"\n\n \n\n He reaches into his jumper and pulls out the key attached to a necklace, holding it out to you. “Here you go,” he says.\n\n \n\n \"Thank you,\" you reply, taking it.\n\n \n\n \"And Em,\" he stammers. “If you'd like to come over one evening... to watch a movie. Just let me know.”\n \n \n\n You smile politely, noncommittally.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n Dennis gives a small, pleased smile. “Okay. For you, sure. Just to have a peek, okay?\"\n\n \n\n He reaches into his jumper and pulls out the key attached to a necklace, holding it out to you. “Here you go,” he says.\n\n \n\n \"Thank you,\" you reply, taking it.\n\n \n\n \"And Em,\" he stammers. “If you'd like to come over one evening... to watch a movie. Just let me know.”\n \n \n\n You smile politely, noncommittally.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Dennis frowns, glancing down. “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”\n\n \n\n You wait for him to say more. He takes a deep breath, as if scared of confrontation. “It just felt like... maybe you weren’t really there. You know?” He shrugs, voice quiet. “On our date.”\n\n \n\n You grimace, understanding the expression on his face now. “Dennis…” \n\n \n\n “It’s a lot to ask, Em,” he cuts you off. “I don’t know why you want that key, but I don’t know if I can trust you. And I don’t want this coming back on me.”\n\n \n\n Actions \n \n <>\n \n \n \n You turn the conversation to topics that you know that Dennis is enthusiastic about.\n \n \n\n Quickly it becomes apparent that he loves old British movies about the Second World War. He tells you all about directors and movie stars that you've only heard of in passing. He casually derides you for how many of them you haven't seen.\n\n \n\n Time goes by ever-so slowly, but eventually the conversation comes to an end. Dennis apologies and tells you he needs to pack up, but enthusiastically tells you to come back another time if you want to talk more. A little too hopefully, he also tells you he spends his weekends in the town's public library, which has an AV room to rival this school's collection.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “If I say yes to a date, do you think you could give me the key?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n His eyes widen and he stares at you. “A date?” he stammers. “Like a real one?”\n\n \n\n You nod and watch his face light up.\n\n \n\n “And you’ll dress-up and look nice and we’ll be out in public together?”\n\n \n\n You nod again, trying not to be condescending. “Would you give me the key then?”\n\n \n\n He giggles nervously. “Okay! I’ll need to just tidy up in there, but okay - if you meet me at Fresh Pot, I’ll give you the key. I’ll do anything for you!”\n\n \n\n You decide to leave him by, as he processes you agreeing to go out to him. “I’ll see you there,” you say, heading for the door.\n \n \n \n\n “Oh, Em!” Dennis says as you are leaving. “Just one thing. I think you’d look really good as a blonde. Really cute. Maybe you could get that done at the Salon on Orchid Road for our date?”\n\n \n\n You notice that for the first time, he’s looking directly at you. You nod, taken aback at his newfound confidence. “We’ll see.”\n\n \n\n He grins and you feel his eyes on you as turn away from him.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I’m sorry, Dennis,” you say politely. “I’ve just got to concentrate on my studies. Now’s not a good time.”\n\n \n\n His gaze returns straight away to what he was doing. “I understand,” he mumbles. “If you change your mind, you can let me know.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “How about you give me the key, and I won’t tell everyone that about the photos I saw in the basement,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n He doesn’t look up, but you can see his teeth clenching. “What photos?”\n\n \n\n “The ones that you’ve taken for Olaf. Ones of girls walking up the stairs. Or in the girls' bathrooms. Or even the girls' changing rooms.”\n\n \n\n He glances up at you briefly, then turns back to what he was doing. “I don’t know what you are talking about.”\n\n \n\n “I think you do, Dennis,” you tell him. “And I bet that the headmaster would like to know about them. Or, perhaps I should tell Jake?”\n\n \n\n His head turns towards you, shaking. “No. Please don’t!”\n\n \n\n “Just give me the key,” you say. “And your secret stays with me.”\n\n \n\n With only the slightest hesitation, he reaches into his jumper and pulls out the key attached to a necklace. He holds it out to you, his hands trembling. “Here you go,” he stammers. “Please! Just don’t say anything!”\n\n \n\n You take the key from him and smile thinly. “Thank you, Dennis. We’ll keep this between us.”\n\n \n\n He nods and looks back down, trying his best to ignore you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You watch Dennis avoid your eyeline and take a deep breath, stirring the familiar sensations of dormant magic inside you.\n\n \n\n Your stomach churns as you feel magic snaking around inside you. It wraps around the cool air that you draw into your lungs. You feel the crackle as it bonds with the elements inside your chest.\n\n \n\n Dennis sits unaware, purposefully staring away from you. Blissfully unaware that, for all intents and purposes, you are about to alter his mind.\n\n \n\n You exhale, watching the gas escape your mouth. Like breathing out into a cold evening, you see your breath hanging in the air, slowly making its way towards Dennis. Unlike on those icy nights, though, the gas sparkles with yellow energy.\n\n \n\n It hits Dennis firmly in the face. He sniffles, inadvertently drawing in your magic.\n\n \n\n Slowly, almost methodically, he turns to look up at you. \"Oh,\" he stammers. \"Hello.\"\n \n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Dennis has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \"I need that key, Dennis,\" you say, letting a hint of malice into your voice. \"I don't have time to mess around.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis glances at you. You see him visibly gulp. \"I can't. Mr. Stitch gave me explicit -\"\n\n \n\n You lean over towards him, letting a thin smile rise on your face. \"Mr. Stitch isn't here. It's just me. And believe me, I can be as much of a problem as Mr. Stitch can be if you get on my bad side.\"\n\n \n\n The lip of the school boy quivers. \"You'll get me in trouble,\" he whispers.\n\n \n\n You flash him a menacing grin. \"You'll be in worse trouble right now if you don't hand it over.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis sniffs, staring back at you, fear in his eyes. Reluctantly, he reaches into his jumper and pulls out the key attached to a necklace. He holds it out to you, his hands trembling. “Here you go,” he stammers. “Please! Leave me alone!”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \"You should give me that key,\" you tell Dennis. \"Or, er, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis stares back at you for a long moment. Then starts to laugh. \"I've read that comic book too! Sometimes Old Pete gets them imported in from America and sells that at the Pharmacy! I didn't know you were into comics too, ?\"\n\n \n\n \"I'm being serious,\" you say, with little confidence.\n\n \n\n He chuckles again. \"I don't know if you've met Mr. Stitch, but I don't think you can get as angry as he can. He gave me explicit instructions not to share the key. Sorry, but I'm not going to risk the wrath of his green form. Now, I should get back to what I was doing.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis titters to himself as he returns to his work. Your attempts to intimidate him have actually lowered his nervousness around you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “You know,” you say casually. “How do you even get out of your own classes to help with the biology lessons?”\n\n \n\n Dennis shifts awkwardly. “Oh. That. Um… I’ve got an understanding with Mr. Harrow. And Stitch. They don’t really get how any of the equipment works.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “You mean the tape decks older than we are?”\n\n \n\n He gives a sheepish laugh. “Yeah, well. They’re technically challenging. I know none of it's cutting-edge, but if the video doesn’t load right or sound doesn't come through, Stitch gets... intense. So I help.”\n\n \n\n You nod, wondering how these people have survived. “You must have a hall pass, then?”\n\n \n\n Dennis glances away. “Sort of. I mean… yeah. Harrow gave me one. Just in case anyone asks.”\n\n \n\n Sensing an opportunity, you lean in slightly. “Think he’d give one to me?”\n\n \n\n Dennis fidgets with the hem of his sleeve. He shakes his head. “He only gave me one because I’m helping. He doesn't just hand them out.”\n\n \n\n You don’t say anything. Just watch him. Your focus makes him fidget nervously.\n\n \n\n “Although,” Dennis continues, “I still have to go to my own classes. It's hard to double-hat. Maybe Harrow wouldn’t mind an extra hand for the boys' lessons.\" Dennis looks at you, wincing slightly. \"Especially if it was, uh, a girl.”\n\n \n\n \n \n Dennis hesitates, chewing his lip. “I could maybe talk to him,” he says carefully. “But… I guess it would depend. On why you want it.”\n\n \n\n He looks up at you, flushed but determined. “Would you maybe want to get a coffee with me? At Fresh Pot? We could talk a bit more about why you need it. I could talk to him after that.”\n\n \n\n His lip is quivering slightly once he stops talking. It takes a moment for you to register what is happening here. He is asking you out on a date.\n\n \n\n Your mind races. It seems insane, but it would get you closer to Dennis and Harrow’s hall pass.\n\n \n\n *Are you considering going out with Dennis for a hall pass, as Emily? Or maybe you could just convince him to do your dirty work for you?*\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n Dennis shifts his weight from foot to foot. “I… could maybe talk to him. After we got that coffee.”\n\n \n\n He won’t quite meet your eyes as you stare back at him. “You’d talk to him if I met you at Fresh Pot?”\n\n \n\n Dennis nods, repeatedly. “Yes! I could definitely do that!” He sniffs. “I’ll see you at Fresh Pot, yeah?”\n\n \n\n You sigh. It seems that Dennis really wants a date with Emily.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n Dennis gives a small, pleased smile. “Okay. For you, sure. I’ll talk to Harrow. He listens to me. And I think he likes the idea of… expanding the team.”\n\n \n\n He pats his pocket. “Come back tomorrow. I should have an answer.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Dennis gives a small, pleased smile. “Okay. For you, sure. I’ll talk to Harrow. He listens to me.

I should have an answer.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n Dennis frowns, glancing down. “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”\n\n \n\n You wait for him to say more. He takes a deep breath, as if scared of confrontation. “It just felt like... maybe you weren’t really there. You know?” He shrugs, voice quiet. “On our date.”\n\n \n\n You grimace, understanding the expression on his face now. “Dennis…” \n\n \n\n “It’s a lot to ask, Em,” he cuts you off. “I don’t know what you’d need a hall pass for, but I don’t know if I can trust you. And I don’t want this coming back on me.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <> \n \n \n \n “If I say yes to a date?” you ask him. “Do you think you could ask Harrow for a hall pass?”\n\n \n\n His eyes widen. He stares at you. “A date?” he stammers. “Like a real one?”\n\n \n\n You nod, and watch as his entire face lights up.\n\n \n\n “And you’ll dress up, and look nice, and we’ll be out in public together?”\n\n \n\n You nod again, trying not to sound condescending. “Would you ask Harrow then?”\n\n \n\n He giggles nervously. “Okay! Yeah, I’ll talk to him. If you meet me at Fresh Pot, I’ll do it. I’ll do anything for you!”\n\n \n\n You step back, letting him ride the wave of adrenaline and disbelief. “I’ll see you there,” you say, turning toward the door.\n \n \n \n \n “Oh, Em!” Dennis calls after you. “Just one thing. I think you’d look really good as a blonde. Really cute. Maybe you could get that done at the salon on Orchid Road? For our date?”\n\n \n\n You pause. It’s the first time he’s really looked at you head-on.\n\n \n\n You nod slowly. “We’ll see.”\n\n \n\n He grins, and you can feel his eyes on your back as you walk away.\n\n \n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n “How about you ask Harrow for a hall pass,” you say calmly. “And I won’t tell anyone about the photos I found in the basement.”\n\n \n\n Dennis freezes. “What photos?” he says stiffly.\n\n \n\n “The ones you’ve taken for Olaf. Of girls walking up the stairs. Or inside the bathrooms. Or changing rooms.”\n\n \n\n His head jerks slightly, but he keeps his head down. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n\n \n\n You step closer. “I think you do. And I bet the Headmaster would be very interested to know. Or maybe Jake should hear about it first.”\n\n \n\n “No,” Dennis stammers. “Please don’t.”\n\n \n\n “Then get me a hall pass,” you say. “And your secret stays safe.”\n\n \n\n For a long moment, he just stares off, at the TV. Then nods. “Fine,” he mutters. “Come back tomorrow. I’ll ask Harrow.”\n\n \n\n You don’t thank him. Instead, you just meet his eyes. He looks away quickly, shame burning across his face.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I need that hall pass, Dennis,” you say flatly, letting a thread of malice into your voice. “I’m not in the mood to negotiate.”\n\n \n\n Dennis glances at you. You see him swallow. Hard.\n\n \n\n “I… I don’t know,” he stammers. “Harrow only gave one to me and -”\n\n \n\n You step in closer, letting a smile edge across your lips. “Harrow’s not here. And neither is Stitch. Just me. And you really don’t want me getting irritated.”\n\n \n\n Dennis stiffens. “I’ll get in trouble.\"\n\n \n\n You tilt your head. “You’re already in trouble if you don’t fix this. Or would you prefer I start asking around about the other things you get up to in the AV room?”\n\n \n\n His face goes pale. “Fine,” he mutters. “I’ll talk to Harrow. Just… just come back tomorrow.”\n\n \n\n You watch him squirm for a moment longer, then step away, leaving the tension in the air behind you. Dennis wipes his palms on his jumper, not daring to meet your eyes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “You should get me that hall pass,” you tell Dennis, narrowing your eyes. “Or… you won’t like me when I’m angry.”\n\n \n\n Dennis stares at you for a long moment. Then breaks into a laugh. “I’ve read that one too! The Incredible Hulk! I didn’t know you were into comics, Em! Did you know that Old Pete gets the reprints in at the pharmacy?”\n\n \n\n You try to hold your expression. “I’m being serious.”\n\n \n\n “Right,” he says, grinning. “Sorry, but I’m not going to risk getting on Stitch's list. I’ve got enough problems to worry about.”\n\n \n\n Dennis hums to himself and turns back to his equipment, noticeably more relaxed. If anything, your attempt at intimidation just made him feel more comfortable around you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Hey Dennis,” you say. “Have you spoken to Harrow yet about that pass?”\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n Dennis doesn’t look up. “Yeah. I did it.”\n\n \n\n He picks at the edge of a cable, avoiding your eyes. “He said it was fine. You can help during the boys’ biology lesson. It’s on at same time as your geography class.”\n\n \n\n He glares at you from beneath his eyebrows, but continues talking. “Just give Prichard this,” he says, tossing the pass on to the table in front of him. “I’ll leave the AV trolley outside the door.”\n\n \n\n “There. You’ve got what you wanted. Don’t talk to me again. And good luck in Harrow’s lesson. You’re going to need it.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Dennis frowns. “No. I haven’t.”\n\n \n\n He sounds drained as he speaks. “I said I’d do it. But I haven’t had a chance. Harrow’s hard to pin down.”\n\n \n\n He runs a hand through his hair. “Don’t push it. Please.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n “Oh! Yeah. I did speak to Mr. Harrow,” he says, nodding quickly. “He was… weirdly into the idea, actually. Said it was good to see a girl showing ‘proactive initiative.’” Dennis makes a face at the phrasing.\n\n \n\n “He said you can help during the boys’ biology lesson. It’s on at the same time as your Geography lesson. Just give this pass to Ms. Prichard,” he says, holding out a pass. “She’ll let you out.”\n\n \n\n He taps the side of the TV cart. “I’ll leave this right outside the boys’ classroom. You just wheel it in like you belong there.”\n\n \n\n He gives a nervous smile. “I hope you know what you’re doing, Em.” He winces. “Those lessons are full of testosterone.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Dennis shifts his weight. “Not yet. Sorry. I haven’t had a chance to catch him.”\n\n \n\n He offers a faint, apologetic smile. “Come back later? I’ll make it happen.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You nod toward the piles cluttering the desk. “What are you doing, Dennis?”\n\n \n\n He stiffens, eyes fixed on the flickering screen. “W-w-watching a movie.”\n\n \n\n “Not that.” You gesture to the teetering stacks of cases. “Those.”\n\n \n\n His hand hovers above his notebook, knuckles tight around the pencil. “Tapes,” he stammers. “I’m… working my way through them.”\n\n \n\n You frown, picking one up. The cover shows a rocket launch frozen in grainy print, the title faded into illegibility. Row after row of them, all documentaries. Space exploration, the cosmos, things that feel less like leisure and more like lessons. “These don’t look like entertainment.”\n\n \n\n Dennis grimaces, as though you’ve caught him out. “Stitch and Harrow asked me for a favour,” he mutters. “Said they’d give me extra credit if I found tapes that… got donated. By accident.”\n\n \n\n You arch a brow. His shoulders sag, the fight going out of him. He leans closer, voice lowering. “Mr. Whitley. The teacher before Harrow. He gave a box of them to the library when he left. Stitch wants them back.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes drift over the spines again. One sleeve in particular prickles against your fingertips. A program on the universe. You blink, and for a heartbeat you see amber eyes peering from the cardboard edge, where no space exists for them. A chill runs through you.\n\n \n\n Dennis notices you staring. He mistakes it for curiosity. “We can watch one, if you like.” His voice drops to a whisper. “They’re not like Harrow’s biology reels. These talk about… facts. Science stuff. I’ve been doing better at school since I started.”\n\n \n\n The tape shifts in your hand, heavy in a way it shouldn’t be. Helpful or not, nothing in Charlton ever comes free.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n \n “What's your favourite tape?” you try. “Any that you couldn’t be without?”\n\n \n\n Dennis brightens at the change of subject, but shakes his head. “Oh, none of these are mine. You can’t get some of them anymore, but I’m glad they’re here for everyone to see. You can learn a lot from old movies.” His eyes flick downward as if retreating into thought.\n\n \n\n You press him like a fish slipping from your grasp. “I would have thought you’d a favourite. There's not one you'd be lost without?”\n\n \n\n Dennis shakes his head again. “I’m not really a collector. My mum says it's impossible to buy presents for me.”\n\n \n\n “Not even your camera?” you try. \"Don't you treasure that?\"\n\n \n\n His shoulders stiffen at you mentioning the object. “I mean… I like it. But it’s just a cheap one. I’ve gone through a few. Sometimes I leave them behind without thinking. They’re… replaceable.”\n\n \n\n “So you don’t have anything personal?” you say, trying not to let frustration seep into your voice. “Nothing personal that you couldn’t be without?”\n\n \n\n Dennis frowns, regarding you suspiciously. “Why are you so interested?”\n\n \n\n “Just trying to get to know you,” you deflect. You flutter your eyes as you lower your voice. “What you value.”\n\n \n\n \n \n Dennis hesitates, then glances away. His cheeks redden. “I still have the receipt,” he says quietly. “From our date.” He looks up, for the first time staring back at you without hesitation. “That means something to me.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n Dennis shifts his weight, eyes flicking to the floor. His voice dips. “Well… there could be something I’d keep.”\n\n \n\n A knot forms in your stomach. “Like what?”\n\n \n\n His eyes lift for the briefest moment, then drop again. “A photo. Of you.”\n\n \n\n As if sensing your reaction, he looks up at you and quickly continues. “I mean, I’ve taken a lot of nice photos, but. Never one of you.”\n\n \n\n You swallow, trying to bury the feelings rising up inside. “You’d treasure that?”\n\n \n\n Dennis nods. “More than anything,” he mutters.\n\n \n\n You stare back at him as he grows red. It’s just a photo, right? But do you really want to send Emily to pose for this boy?\n\n \n\n Or worse still, do you want to do it yourself?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n “Do you think I could see it?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n Dennis blinks at you, confused. “Uh… right now?”\n\n \n\n When you nod, he fumbles in his wallet. He produces it carefully, almost reverently.\n\n \n\n The bill from a date, still pristine. At the bottom, in a neat scrawl is Flo’s handwriting: “Hope you had a good time x”. You note that Dennis left a modest tip.\n\n \n\n As you look, you notice his eyes never leave the slip of paper, as if afraid it might vanish or be torn from him. There's a stirring from the amulet.\n\n \n\n You feel the words to the transformation spell on the tip of your tongue, spurring on the amulet as if it is anticipating this. Glancing back at Dennis though, the realisation catches you. He's a man.\n\n \n\n And when you're in his body, you won't be able to cast magic. And make him forget what he's just seen.\n\n \n\n The answer is obvious. You need him unconscious first.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n \n <>\n\n \n Cast Sleep & Forget on Dennis - *You'll need to be in the school library at lunch to transform into Dennis for the lessons*\n\n \n <>\n\n You gently stretch the receipt back out to Dennis. He takes it quickly, checking it for damage, then puts it back into his wallet.\n\n \n\n \"Why so interested?\" he stammers, as he pockets his wallet.\n\n \n\n \"I just... like that you keep it,\" you feign. And you note that your response draws more red to his cheeks.\n\n \n\n Getting good at that, aren't you?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \"How about you take a photo of me, then?\" you offer, as casually as possible. It still causes Dennis to freeze, blinking at you as if he misheard.\n\n \n\n “Really?”\n\n \n\n You nod. His face floods with colour. “O-okay. Right. Just... just wait a moment.”\n\n \n\n He fumbles with his bag, pulling out a squat polaroid camera. He then looks around, standing and walking over towards a blank wall, almost tripping over his own bag. He pulls down a white projection screen and pushes a chair out of the way, creating a space in front of it.\n\n \n\n “Just… stand there,\" he says, moving back to the other side of the desk. \"I mean, only if you want to.\"\n\n \n\n You smile politely at him, but stand and walk over to the projection screen. Your anxiety easing with each stammer from Dennis. You stand casually, looking back at him.\n\n \n\n \"Like this?\"\n\n \n\n \"Yeah,\" he says, trying not to look at you. Then he raises the camera to his face and you feel a lump in your throat. \"Perfect,” Dennis mutters, his face hidden, sidestepping as he studies you through a viewfinder.\n\n \n\n The camera snaps as he snaps a shot, making you jump. The camera whirs, spitting out the square of paper. He waves it in the air, watching it bloom. His mouth twists. “It’s… okay. But not quite right.”\n\n \n\n He looks back at you, again trying to avoid looking. \"Try smiling?\" he asks, voice trembling. \"Or you don't have to. If you don't want to. Maybe... just look natural.\"\n\n \n\n As you shift slightly and smile politely, you don't feel exploited. There's a tension in the air, but it all stems from Dennis. As he takes another snap and his frown deepens as the polaroid comes into focus, you realise that he doesn't really know what he's doing.\n\n \n\n Or isn't assertive enough to be able to tell you what he really wants.\n\n \n \n At this rate, he’ll burn through them all unless you step in.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n \n <> \n \n <>\n \n\n As you watch Dennis fumble with the camera, something inside you hardens. If you leave him in charge, he’ll waste them all.\n\n \n\n “Here,” you say, straightening. “Let me.”\n\n \n\n Dennis blinks, lowering the camera slightly. “W-what do you mean?”\n\n \n\n \n \n Instead of answering, you turn to the side, sliding one hand down to tug your dress up. You arch your back, deliberately shaping the curve of your body. Then you twist your head, giving him a coy glance over your shoulder.\n\n \n Instead of answering, you turn around, back facing him, pulling at your skirt just enough to reveal a flash of your underwear.

Aware that your skirt has ridden up around your waist, exposing your underwear. You flash him a smile.\n\n \n \n\n Dennis freezes. The room goes silent. As you stand there, for the first time he takes you in. You notice him gulp.\n\n \n\n Click.\n\n \n\n The camera snaps, ejecting the Polaroid with a mechanical whir. His hands tremble as he snatches it, waving it quickly, eyes fixed on the image as it develops.\n\n \n\n “This…” his voice cracks. “This one’s perfect.”\n\n \n\n You can feel the heat of his gaze still darting between you and the photo. The rush is undeniable. Not just his approval, but the control of making him look exactly where you wanted.\n\n \n\n Dennis swallows, holding the Polaroid out towards you like an offering. His fingers are white at the edges, reluctant to let go. \"You want to see?\"\n\n \n\n Taking the photo, you glance down to see Emily's smiling face posing for the camera.

As he wordlessly raises the camera and takes another snap, you grimace.\n\n \n\n “Just.. turn a little,\" he mutters from behind the viewfinder. \"No, back. Chin up. Maybe both hands on your hips? Or not… actually, just stay like that.”\n\n \n\n You follow each fumbling command, letting him adjust you with words alone. His instructions are clumsy and his mood sours with each photo he takes. For your part, you are left with a series of conflicting directions, feeling progressively awkward as you attempt to contort your body to accommodate his bumbling asks.\n\n \n\n After a few more snaps, Dennis lowers the camera. \"That's all the film I've got,\" he mutters.\n\n \n\n You join him as he surveys the spread of polaroid photos on the table. A series of snaps of Emily, looking confused and uncomfortable, twisting her body into inelegant poses.\n\n \n\n \"Thanks for trying,\" Dennis stammers. \"I guess I'm no good at this.\"\n\n \n\n \"Maybe we could try again?\" you offer. \"When you've got more film?\"\n\n \n\n Dennis shrugs, almost in defeat. He gathers up the photos and tosses them into a paper bin. \"Sure.\"\n\n \n\n One thing's for sure, you think. You'll need to be firmer with him to get him something he treasures. Or, as you watch him return to the table, maybe there's something that you could wear that would inspire him.\n\n \n\n Are you really thinking of dressing up for him?\n\n \n\n You grimace. But you really need him to treasure the photo. Maybe you should speak to Emily about looking through her wardrobe for something else to wear.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \"Hey Dennis,\" you begin. \"Do you think I could see that photo you took again?\"\n\n \n\n There is a momentary look of confusion on his face, as he flinches. \"Which one?\"\n\n \n\n You bury any urge to unpack what he just said and smile politely. \"The one of me.\"\n\n \n\n His eyes light up, and he scrambles into his pocket. \"This one?\" he says, holding out the Polaroid out towards you.\n\n \n\n Taking the photo, you glance down to see Emily's smiling face posing for the camera. Around your neck, the amulet tingles.\n\n \n \n You feel the words to the transformation spell on the tip of your tongue, spurring on the amulet as if it is anticipating this. Glancing back at Dennis though, the realisation catches you. He's a man.\n\n \n\n And when you're in his body, you won't be able to cast magic. And make him forget what he's just seen.\n\n \n\n The answer is obvious. You need him unconscious first.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n \n \n\n \n Cast Sleep & Forget on Dennis - *You'll need to be in the school library at lunch to transform into Dennis*\n\n \n <>\n\n \"Hey Dennis,\" you begin. \"Do you think I could see that receipt you kept?\"\n\n \n\n There is a momentary look of confusion on his face, as he flinches. \"What receipt?\"\n\n \n\n You smile politely, burying the resistance to say the words. \"The one from our date.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis blinks at you, confused. “Uh… right now?”\n\n \n\n When you nod, he fumbles in his wallet. He produces it carefully. As you look, you notice his eyes never leave the slip of paper. There's a stirring from the amulet.\n\n \n\n You feel the words to the transformation spell on the tip of your tongue, spurring on the amulet as if it is anticipating this. Glancing back at Dennis though, the realisation catches you. He's a man.\n\n \n\n And when you're in his body, you won't be able to cast magic.

His confusion turns to panic, but it quickly falters as the spell takes hold. His eyes roll back and his body folds like a marionette with its strings cut, tumbling on to the desk with a soft thud.\n\n \n\n You hurry forward, checking to make sure he's alright. He’s limp, bruised, but breathing shallow. As you check his face, it twitches, before smoothing into blankness.\n\n \n\n Glancing around, you see the perfect place to lay him to rest. The room is already dark from the blacked out windows. A corner behind the unused teacher's desk is perfect for what you need.\n\n \n\n You drag him carefully by the arms, the teenager weighing no more than you do right now, and lay him down in the darkness. He rolls over to his side, but doesn't stir. In slumber, Dennis finally looks peaceful. No nervousness or anxiety stretching his face. He seems almost content.\n\n \n\n Taking a deep breath, you ready yourself for your next step.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "“Hey Liz, I need a favour,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n She looks at you from over the rim of her glasses. “Sure,” she says after a moment. “What’s up?”\n\n \n\n You take a step closer, lowering your voice. “I need you to cause a distraction after school. Enough to make Prichard leave her classroom.”\n\n \n\n A half-smile rises up on Liz’s face. “Do I want to know why?”\n\n \n\n You match her expression. “Let’s just say there’s something that needs investigating in there. Something very cursed.”\n\n \n \n \n Her half-smile twitches with excitement. “A curse? Is that what’s causing it?” You nod and her eyes gleam.\n\n \n\n “And you can remove it?” \n\n \n\n You nod again. “So you'll help?\"\n\n \n\n She holds your stare for a moment, her smile thinning. “Say I do. Can you teach me how to lift the curses too?”\n\n \n\n “It’s more that I know how to change them,” you try to explain, but this only encourages her. \n\n \n\n “Even better! Think what we can do if we both know how to do that! Come on, *Emily*. Share the knowledge!” \n\n \n\n You stare at her, almost blinded by beaming enthusiasm. You could really do with Liz’ help, but do you think she should know more magic?\n\n \n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n But regardless of whether you would teach her, you can't. You tell her honestly that you don't know how to perform the curse. \n\n \n\n \"Well, you best get learning it then!\" she replies, smiling. \"I'm sure our mutual friend at the junk shop might be able to help. You should go see her. We're not exactly on great terms - she thinks I don't take these things seriously enough. But I'm sure she'll teach you!\"\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n A slight frown appears on Liz's face. \"A curse? What do you mean?\"\n\n \n\n The young woman stares back at you, blankly. She has no idea what a curse is, as she has no idea about magic.\n\n \n\n \"It's not important,\" you deflect. \"I just need to get into the classroom. If I were to find myself in detention, do you think you could distract Prichard for a while?\"\n\n \n\n \"You? In detention?\" Elizabeth looks taken aback by the idea. \"Okay Emily, you did try and help to tutor me. And tried to help when I passed out. I guess I owe you. If I see you in there, I have a few ideas of how to get Prichard's attention.\"\n\n \n\n \"Thanks Liz,\" you say. She smiles pleasantly at you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n\n ”Hey Liz,” you say quietly. \"You've got something in your eyes.”\n\n \n\n You launch your arm forward and snatch her glasses from her face before she can even realise what you’re doing. Immediately and instinctively you see her pupils try to compensate, squinting as she adjusts to her limited vision.\n\n \n\n “Look at you, you must be as blind as a bat!” you say, leaping back to avoid her lunges at your hands. “Maybe you’re the exception to the rule and you look worse without these nerdy things.”\n\n \n\n A small circle of students forms around you and Liz, who tries in vain to grab back her spectacles. Her lack of depth perception is obvious. She staggers around and you evade her easily.\n\n \n\n “Give them back, you bitch!” Liz snaps, her teeth snarling with anger. Meanwhile, other students are starting to laugh.\n\n \n\n “Careful there Liz,” you continue. “You wouldn’t want to cause an accident.” Dramatically you let go of the glasses. They fall to the floor. You raise your shoe over them.\n\n \n\n Liz freezes at the clattering as her frames bounce on ceramic. “Why?” she asks.\n\n \n\n “Because under all that make-up and short skirt and ripped tights,” you reply. “You need to be reminded of what you are.”\n\n \n\n You put your heel over one of the lenses. “That is, a spectacled little nerd.”\n\n \n\n The sound of crunching glass gets a cheer from the crowd. A random student sticks their leg out as Liz spins around and she falls backwards, landing with a crunch on her back. She whimpers in pain.\n\n \n\n The cheers from the crowd die down, but Liz’ whimpering continues. Slowly, the crowd disperses. You turn around and walk off. In all probability, Liz will never talk to you again. But you believe you are one step to acceptance by Christina and her friends.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Alright, I’ll do it,” you tell Liz. \n\n \n\n “Wonderful,” she says, with a crooked smile. “Call me in the evening and I’ll come over. And when we’re done - I’ll know exactly how to cause a little distraction.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You feign an excuse. “I’m not sure Gladys at the junk shop would be happy with me doing that.”\n\n \n\n Liz looks at you, but shrugs. “No spell, no scene. But your call, *Emily*. Let me know if you change your mind.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “What are you reading?” you ask her, glancing at the books sprawled over the table.\n\n \n \n \n “Research,” she tells you quietly. “This library has a few secrets of its own, if you know where to look.”\n\n \n\n She turns a book around to face you. “Have a read. Anything seem familiar?”\n\n \n\n You glance at it. The book is titled *“Under the soil - A History of Pagan Britain.\"* Reading through the open pages, the author is recalling an eye-witness account of a festival celebrating May Day. You recognise references to fields and farmlands that surround Charlton. One paragraph stands out to you:\n\n \n\n The three-day event was brought to a climax on May Day by Lord Raglan Greenwood, Baron of Howerby, whose hour-long rally whipped his enamoured audience, mostly young women, into a writhing frenzy. As he read from the Translations of the Sevrene Shards, his brilliant smile captivated his flock and his Hecate Wheel amulet outshone even the spring morning sun. Lennon and his recently disbanded group may have been more popular than Jesus, but if Greenwood had their exposure he’d unquestionably be the Almighty Father.\n\n \n\n “Remind you of anything?” Liz says after she sees you pull back from the book. \n\n \n\n “What’s this book mentioned?\" you ask. “The Seven Shards?”\n\n \n\n “Sevrene”, Liz corrects you. “It’s referenced in other books too. The library is supposed to have a copy, but it’s always checked out.” She leans towards you, smirking. “If someone were to stake out the library, they might just see who keeps on borrowing it.”\n \n \n Liz seems a bit embarrassed by your question. \"School work,\" she says quickly.\n\n \n\n You glance at the old tomes laid out in front of her. They don't look like school books. In fact, you would bet money that they are about the occult.\n\n \n\n \"I didn't learn that when I was at school,\" you say.\n\n \n\n She giggles, remembering too late that she's in a library. \"You caught me. I'm writing. I like to write stories on the side. About magic. I'm doing some research. It's always fascinated me. Something about it calls to me, like an urge or a dream.\"\n\n \n\n Her face drains of joy, as if she's trying to remember something but it's just out of reach. But then she shakes it off.\n\n \n\n \"It must seem childish,\" she says quietly.\n\n \n\n \"Just so long as you know the difference between fact and fiction,\" you can't help but comment.\n\n \n\n This causes her to laugh, just a little. You hear a librarian shush from the counter.\n\n \n\n \"Anyway, it's just a bit of fun,\" she tells you.\n \n \n Liz actually seems to blush. \"School work,\" she says quickly.\n\n \n\n You glance at the old tomes laid out in front of her. They don't look like school books. In fact, you would bet money that they are about the occult.\n\n \n\n \"Interesting topics you study at Charlton,\" you say, sardonically.\n\n \n\n Her face continues to turn red. \"Fine. I'm writing. Stories. About magic. I've always been fascinated by the subject. It's as if something about it calls to me, like an urge or a dream.\"\n\n \n\n Her face drains of joy, as if she's trying to remember something but it's just out of reach. But then she shakes it off.\n\n \n\n \"It must seem childish,\" she says quietly.\n\n \n\n \"Just so long as you know the difference between fact and fiction,\" you can't help but comment.\n\n \n\n This causes her to laugh, just a little. You hear a librarian shush from the counter.\n\n \n\n \"Anyway, it's just a bit of fun,\" she tells you.\n\n \n Liz smiles. You can sense a hint of embarrassment on her face. \"I write,\" she says. \"Stories. In my spare time. This is research.\"\n\n \n\n You glance at the old books laid out in front of her. They look like they are about the occult.\n\n \n\n \"What are you writing about?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n \"Magic,\" she says, almost reluctantly. \"Witches, wizards, spells. I guess I never grew out of Harry Potter. Must seem a bit silly to you.\"\n\n \n\n She looks at you, almost blushing. You offer a sympathetic smile.\n\n \n\n \"We all have our guilty pleasures,\" you say.\n\n \n\n At this, she breaks out into a grin. \"I find it fascinating! Can you imagine if you could cast spells, Em? Imagine how much fun you could have!\"\n\n \n\n You say nothing as she drifts off into her own indulgent fantasies.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You take out *Translations of the Sevrene Shards* and put it down on the table, smiling knowingly at Liz. \n\n \n\n Her eyes grow large when she sees the title and she hurriedly flicks through the pages. “Oh. My. God. Where did you get this?”\n\n \n\n “A mutual acquaintance,” you tell her. “She had enough time with it.”\n\n \n\n Liz grins, but her attention drifts to the new book. “Fascinating,” she murmurs. “Hey, do you think I could borrow this?”\n\n \n\n She says it casually, but you can tell by the way she’s already grasping it with both hands that this means a lot to her. You surmise that if you agree, you won’t get it back for some time. Also, you wonder if giving someone like Liz more knowledge of magic is such a good idea.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n <> \n\n With only a slight hesitation, you reach out and place the book down in front of Liz.\n\n \n\n She snatches the book up to her chest, beaming with excitement. “Thank you!” she cries loud enough to draw some tuts and shushes from the librarians. \n\n \n\n “Thank you,” she repeats. This time whispering.\n\n \n\n You nod politely, watching as she opens the book to the first page and quickly her focus falls away from you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “Maybe after I’ve finished with it,” you tell Liz, taking it back. \n\n \n\n The smile drops from her face and her eyes watch with disappointment as you take the book back. “Okay,” she says, “I’d love to read it. Once you’re done.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “I need to know more about the amulet,” you say.\n\n \n\n Liz lets her enthusiastic smile waver slightly and adjusts her glasses as she matches your serious demeanour. “Okay. How can I help?”\n\n \n\n \"Firstly, where did it come from?\"\n\n \n\n “There’s an old shop on Avian Lane,” she replies. “Wedged between McTafey’s bar and some other building. It’s funny - until I was looking for it I don’t remember being aware of it before.”\n\n \n\n “Magic?” you ask. Liz shrugs.\n\n \n\n “There’s an old lady that runs it,” she continues. “She was sweet and kind. Reminded me of my grandmother. When I picked out the amulet off a stand of old jewelry and rings, she told me that I was meant to find it. She practically gave it away. And slipped the note into the shopping bag when I paid for it.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “An old lady in a mysterious junk shop? Did she ask if you were from Hogwarts?”\n\n \n\n \n Liz’s mischievous grin returns. “Scoff all you want, but you’re the woman who sometimes looks like other people. Who knows what’s real and fiction anymore.”\n \n \n Liz’s mischievous grin returns. “Scoff all you want, but you’re the man who sometimes looks like a girl. Who knows what’s real and fiction anymore.”\n\n \n \n\n “Do you know anything more about the amulet?” you ask, trying to change the topic from your current physical form.\n\n \n\n Liz shrugs. “Only what I found in my research. Something to help those who need help. I bet that old lady knows more though.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n “I need to know as much as you know about… everything,” you begin. “About *magic*,” you add, almost conspiratorially. “If I’m going to help.”\n\n \n\n She takes a deep breath and nods, glancing around the corridor checking if anyone is listening. “Alright. I’ll tell you what I know.”\n\n \n\n \"So, what is it?\" you ask her.\n\n \n\n “What is it? It’s amazing,” she says, excitedly. “And terrifying, of course. But still - can you believe it? Actual magic. In the real world.” \n\n \n\n You stare back at her. Not for the first time, she tapers her enthusiasm. “I guess you can believe it,” she adds.\n\n \n\n “What do you know about it?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Just a bit,” she says, lowering her voice to a hushed tone. “It feels like warmth. Inside your body. Like when you stand next to a fire and suddenly feel the heat. Except, it’s inside you.”\n\n \n\n \"How did you learn about it?\" \n\n \n\n \"Google,\" she says, with a smile. \"Or a bit of research here. You would be surprised how many books this place has nested away.\"\n\n \n\n “When I was first testing my research,” she continues. “Late one night I thought I’d just try. I tried a spell I’d uncovered that claimed to put someone to sleep. I felt a rush. Fire. Energy inside my body. Then two hours later, I woke up.”\n\n \n\n You nod, silently. Thinking about the similar sensation you felt when you used the amulet. After a moment, you focus again. “You can cast spells?” \n\n \n\n It’s her turn to nod, that gleaming smile returning. “Just one. Sends people to sleep. Plus, they have trouble remembering anything recent. The more I practise, the longer people forget. My mum has been complaining of forgetting things a lot recently.”\n\n \n\n Liz looks to you, a glint in her eye. “I can teach you, if you like.”\n\n Liz looks to you, a glint in her eye. “I can teach you, if you like. One thing though - every book I’ve read says that magic can only be learned by a woman.”\n\n \n \n\n Without waiting for a response, Liz rips out a page from her notebook and scrawls her phone number down. She hands it to you. “Call me in the evening and I’ll come over.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n \n \n You focus the spell carefully, weaving the magic as Elizabeth stares at you. For a moment, the air around her seems to still, and then blinks as if a new thought just occurred to her. When she resumes, her tone is the same, but there’s an ease in her demeanor that wasn’t there before.\n\n \n\n \"You know,\" she says, tilting her head slightly, \"it’s actually kind of fun talking to you. You don’t just zone out like half the people here.\" She smiles warmly, her hands gesturing as she dives back into the flow of the conversation. \"Anyway, as I was saying.. well. What was I saying? I've lost my train of thought. Was there something you needed from me?\"\n\n \n\n Her energy remains high, her grin returning. There’s a subtle shift, though. She seems more attentive to you, leaning in slightly as she listens, her smile lingering a little longer.\n\n \n You steady yourself, weaving the spell as Elizabeth talks. The magic flows toward her, but the moment it reaches her, it dissipates entirely, like a ripple vanishing in still water. She stops mid-sentence, her bright, curious expression hardening in an instant as her gaze snaps to yours.\n\n \n\n \"Wait.\" Her voice is quiet, almost calm, but there’s a dangerous edge to it. \"Did you just -\" She exhales sharply, her jaw tightening. \"Was that a charm spell? On me?\"\n\n \n\n Her tone rises, incredulous. \"What is wrong with you? Do you seriously think I wouldn’t notice?\" She takes a step forward, her eyes narrowing as her usual enthusiasm turns into a cold, cutting anger. \"You really thought you could manipulate me? After everything I’ve said about Charlton? Do you even listen when I talk?\"\n\n \n\n Elizabeth shakes her head, her hands clenched into fists at her sides. \"I don’t know what’s worse. That you thought it would work or that you thought I wouldn’t care. Here’s the thing,\" she says, her voice dropping to a sharp whisper, \"I do care. And I don’t ever want to feel like someone’s trying to pull that kind of garbage on me again.\"\n\n \n\n She steps back, her usual energy completely drained, replaced by a cold, bitter disappointment. \"Next time, just talk to me like a normal person. Or don’t talk to me at all.\"\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “Hey Liz,” you begin. “This is going to sound funny, but I had a dream...\"\n\n \n\n Liz gives you a smirk. “Am I about to get an insight into your wild fantasies, ?”\n\n \n\n You roll your eyes. “I’m serious, Liz. This was intense. Magical, even.”\n\n \n\n At this, Liz turns her head to the side slightly. Her smile wavers. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n\n “I dreamed that I was having coffee with Jennifer,” you begin. “When we first became friends. Except, we were interrupted by Dan Mandel. From work. He wouldn’t shut up about men being men.”\n\n “I dreamed that I was back on a date with Jennifer,” you begin. “When we first started dating. Except, we were interrupted by Dan Mandel. From work. He wouldn’t shut up about men being men.”\n\n \n\n Liz shrugs. “That sounds like the typical Charlton man. Come on, . It was just a dream.\"\n\n \n\n You grimace. “There’s more. When I woke up, I felt…” You drift off, trying to find words to describe the nagging feeling in the back of your brain. “Do I look different to you?”\n\n \n\n \n She gives you an appraising look. “Nothing strikes out. Maybe a few more bags under the eyes. Finding it hard to sleep lately?”\n\n She chuckles. “Do you really want me to answer that?”\n\n \n\n “Come on, Liz,” you shut her down. “I think something’s different. Something’s changed. But I can’t remember what it is.”\n\n \n\n “So then, don’t worry about it?” Liz says, a hint of impatience to her words.\n\n \n\n “What if it’s permanent, though. What if… it continues. And I can’t see the changes when they happen.”\n\n \n\n Liz considers your words, thinking. After a long pause, she sighs. “Listen, if you’re really concerned there’s things you can try. That amulet isn’t the only source of magic in Charlton, after all.”\n\n \n\n “I came across a few things whilst studying,” she continues. “There’s articles online about the flower power movement. How it had a big presence here. They experimented, and not just with love, if you know what I mean. They were into expanding their minds.\"\n\n \n\n \"Like with acid?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n \"And other things.\" Liz giggles. \"There’s some magazines in the library stacks from that time. They set up their own publishing house in Charlton. Rumour is, their publications could - again - expand their minds.\"\n\n \n\n \"Even I wouldn’t risk playing around with them, but if you’re desperate then it might be worth you taking a look at.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “You think reading old magazines is going to help?” \n\n \n\n Liz rolls her eyes. “Use your brain, dummy. This is Charlton. I wouldn’t mention it if there wasn’t something special about them. Try looking up Sally Hope Publishing. Word of warning though. I wouldn't touch anything that group put out. And that's coming from me.”\n\n \n\n She gives you a grin. With her boundless enthusiasm for magic, you wonder exactly what could scare Liz off. But if it could help you, perhaps it's worth investigating.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \"I was wondering...” you say. “Do you know of any spell that could let someone be in two places at once?\"\n\n \n\n That gets her attention. She arches an eyebrow, smirking. \"Isn’t that what the amulet’s for? You and Emily, pulling the twin act. Pretty convincing, if you ask me.\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"I don’t mean as Emily. I mean me. As me.\"\n\n \n\n You explain everything. The demotion to secretary, the mountain of admin, the missed meetings, the feeling of everything slipping through your fingers. You’re trying to keep your job and investigate the school, but there’s too much. And Emily suggested… maybe magic could help.\n\n \n\n Liz leans back, watching you with interest now. “So Emily’s the one pushing magical body doubles now? Guess she’s really getting into it.”\n\n \n\n You hesitate. “Or maybe she’s feeling left out.”\n\n \n\n Liz shrugs. “Could be both.”\n\n \n\n You wait. But she just sighs. “I don’t know anything that would do that. At least, not cleanly. Not safely.”\n\n \n\n \"Nothing?\" you ask. \"No workaround?\"\n\n \n\n She gives you a look. “You could try the junk shop. You-know-who, I mean. If anyone in this town has a line on obscure magic, it’s her.”\n\n \n\n You nod slowly. “And no one else? Nothing that you’ve come across in your research that could help?”\n\n \n\n Liz is quiet a beat too long.\n\n \n\n “There are… fragments,” she says carefully. “Notes that infer the bits of magic scattered around Charlton. Someone had some fun way back when playing around with it. But they’re charms. Trinkets. Nothing like what you’re describing. What you want is more advanced than I know about. Even anything at the school.”\n\n \n\n You lean in. “There must be something. Someone.”\n\n \n\n Liz’s expression tightens. Then, reluctantly: “If you can’t find help here... well, there’s the carnival.”\n\n \n\n Your stomach twists. “The one outside town?”\n\n \n\n She nods. “I don’t know much. Just that every time it rolls in, something strange happens. Old papers talk about sudden fights, people going missing, unexplained accidents. Always when the carnival’s here.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “You think that’s it’s magic?”\n\n \n\n Liz shudders. “I think it’s something. I’ve walked past it, and I swear - I feel cold. Not like weather-cold. Like... wrong. Skin-crawling wrong.”\n\n \n\n She meets your eyes. “But if you’re serious about this, maybe that’s where you’ll find what you need.”\n\n \n\n She adds, almost as an afterthought: “If you’re that desperate.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n “I had some trouble with a spell,” you begin. “I tried casting it on the school janitor, but it didn’t work.”\n\n \n\n “You tried to cast magic on that creepy janitor?” Liz exclaims, failing to keep her voice low. “That’s bold, . Even for you.”\n\n \n\n “It was in the basement,” you correct her. \"No one saw.”\n\n \n\n She raises an eyebrow, but shrugs it off. “What happened?”\n\n \n\n “I cast it correctly,” you tell her, trying to ignore her scowl. “But it just didn’t take. Almost as if something was protecting him.” You snort. “It’s lucky he’s not the smartest tool in his box.”\n\n \n\n Liz offers you only a wince before speaking. “Sounds like it’s nothing to do with you. Maybe there’s something at the school that affects magic. I wouldn’t know - I might love all this, but I would think twice about using magic at school.”\n\n \n\n “But maybe ask our mutual friend,” she adds. “If anyone is old enough to know what’s what, it’s her.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "“Can you help me do my make-up?” you ask her. \n\n \n\n Emily raises an eyebrow. \"This is a role reversal. Until recently I was asking you.\"\n\n \n\n \"You know your face better,\" you reply.\n\n \n\n She shrugs. \"Okay. Let's go to the bathroom. This better be worth it.\"\n\n \n “Can you help me do my make-up?” you ask her. \n\n \n\n For a moment she just stares at you. “Fine. Let’s go to the bathroom. This had better be worth it.”\n\n \n \n \n You follow her as she leads you to the bathroom. She instructs you to sit on the bath rim and she takes out a number of products from the cabinet.\n\n \n\n For the next fifteen minutes, Emily applies a variety of products to your face. She works quickly and silently, having done this time and time before. You sit passively as creams are worked across your face, powder is peppered over your skin and gloss is pressed against your lips.\n\n \n\n “Hold still,” she says when you squirm. “We’re almost done.”\n\n \n\n Finally, Emily steps back and looks at you. “There. Take a look.” She nods towards the bathroom mirror.\n\n \n\n You stand up and glance at your reflection. The face of Emily stares back at you, but it’s not the image you’ve become accustomed to. Her eyes look large and radiant. Her lips are glossy and pronounced. Her skin is smooth and clear of the blemishes you’ve noticed as you’ve inhabited her body.\n\n \n\n You look cute.\n\n \n\n *Or do you mean sexy?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “Do you think you could help me pick out some clothes?” you say to her quietly.\n\n \n\n She smirks a little. \"You might recognise a few things. I haven't got a lot that you didn't hand down to me.\"\n\n \n\n \"At least I'll like them\", you reply.\n\n \n\n Emily shrugs. \"Let's go have a look in wardrobe, then.\"\n\n \n “Do you think you could help me pick out some clothes?” you say to her quietly.\n\n \n\n She rolls her eyes. “You’re really going all in on this aren’t you? Fine. Let’s go to my room.”\n\n \n \n\n You follow Emily into her bedroom and sit down on her bed as she looks through her wardrobe. “If it were me, I’d just wear something casual. You don’t want to give him any ideas. She pulls out a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. What about this?”\n\n \n\n You glance at her selection, remembering that Dennis asked you to wear something nice. You don’t think that jeans and a T-shirt was what he had in mind.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n \n “That's fine,” you tell her. She throws the T-shirt and jeans down on the bed. “I would say try it on, but I think the fit shouldn't be a problem.”\n\n \n\n You begin to take off your clothes, feeling a bit strange stripping down to your underwear in this form. You've changed in front of Emily more times than you can remember, but it feels foreign to do it as her. She watches you as you do so, a curious look as she observes her body from an outside perspective.\n\n \n\n \"Do you think I've lost weight?\" she asks, as you pick up the clothes from the bed.\n\n \n\n You pull on the jeans and T-shirt, not replying. The jeans hug your legs and the T-shirt is snug, feeling tight across your breasts. “What do you think?” you ask Emily.\n\n \n\n She walks over to you and pulls at your clothes, adjusting them slightly. “There,” she says, then adds: “You look cute.”\n\n \n\n You smile meekly at her, trying to digest how strange this scenario is for both of you. “I should get going,” you say.\n\n \n\n “Enjoy,” she deadpans. “And don’t do anything I would do. I mean it. Anything else?”\n\n \n “That will do,” you tell her. She throws the T-shirt and jeans down on the bed. “I would say try it on, but I think the fit shouldn't be a problem.”\n\n \n\n You look between her and the clothes, hesitating. She senses your reluctance. “I’ve seen it all before. Literally.”\n\n \n\n You don’t reply and once again she sighs, turning around. “I thought sisters were supposed to be okay getting undressed in front of each other,” she says.\n\n \n\n You begin to take off your clothes and pull on the jeans and T-shirt, not replying. The jeans hug your legs and the T-shirt is snug, feeling tight across your breasts. “You can turn around now,” you tell Emily.\n\n \n\n She walks over to you and pulls at your clothes, correcting how you’ve put the clothes on. “There,” she says, then adds: “You look cute.”\n\n \n\n You smile meekly at her, trying to digest how strange this scenario is for both of you. “I should get going,” you say.\n\n \n\n “Enjoy,” she deadpans. “And don’t do anything I would do. I mean it. Anything else?”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “I was thinking, maybe a dress?” you say to your sister. Her eyebrows raise, but she turns back to her wardrobe. “You really want his help, don’t you?” \n\n \n\n She flicks through the hangers and pulls out a dress, throwing it on to the bed. It’s the sundress that you remembered Emily wearing on the holiday last year. You remember when you first changed. Seeing your toned legs stretching out from your torso, exposed as the hem clung to your thighs.\n\n \n\n \"This wasn't one of mine,\" you say, as you pick up the cotton dress. \"I remember you wearing it on holiday.\"\n\n \n\n \"I'm surprised you noticed,\" she says, grinning. \"Your attention was consumed by that lifeguard.\"\n\n \n\n You take off your clothes and pull the dress over your head, letting it fall down your body. It hangs off your shoulders, but looking down you see again how low-cut the dress is, exposing the tops of your breasts. The hem cuts off halfway down your thigh. You consider that whilst you won’t have to be careful sitting down, it shows off a lot of your toned legs.\n\n \n\n “Here,” Emily says as she emerges again from her wardrobe. She holds out a pair of sandals with a small heel to them. “These will look good with it.”\n\n \n\n You sit down on the bed again to put on the shoes. When you’re done, you stand and Emily makes some minor adjustments to how the dress rests on your figure.\n\n \n\n “You look ready for a date,” your sister says, with some reluctance in her voice. “Good luck. Anything else?”\n\n \n “I was thinking, maybe a dress?” you say to your sister. Her eyebrows raise, but she turns back to her wardrobe. “You really want his help, don’t you?” \n\n \n\n She flicks through the hangers and pulls out a dress, throwing it on to the bed. It’s the sundress that you remembered Emily wearing on the holiday last year. You remember when you first changed. Seeing your toned legs stretching out from your torso, exposed as the hem clung to your thighs.\n\n \n\n “Can you turn around?” you ask her, as you pick up the cotton dress. Again, she sighs, but she complies.\n\n \n\n You take off your clothes and pull the dress over your head, letting it fall down your body. It hangs off your shoulders, but looking down you see again how low-cut the dress is, exposing the tops of your breasts. The hem cuts off halfway down your thigh. You consider that whilst you won’t have to be careful sitting down, it shows off a lot of your toned legs.\n\n \n\n “Here,” Emily says as she turns around. She holds out a pair of sandals with a small heel to them. “These will look good with it.”\n\n \n\n You sit down on the bed again to put on the shoes, conscious to keep your legs together. When you’re done, you stand and Emily makes some minor adjustments to how the dress rests on your figure.\n\n \n\n “You look ready for a date,” your sister says, with some reluctance in her voice. “Good luck. Anything else?”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “We really need his help,” you tell your sister. “I think it needs to be something... a bit more sexy.”\n\n \n\n Emily stops what she’s doing and looks at you. “This is just about getting Dennis' help, right? You’re not looking forward to this, are you?”\n\n \n\n You snort. “Of course not.” But Emily’s narrowed eyes tell you that she doesn’t believe you. \n\n \n\n She turns back to the wardrobe and rummages in the back, where you can tell she stores things she doesn’t typically wear. After a minute, she throws down two pieces of clothing on the bed. “That’s the best I can do.”\n\n \n\n You look at her choices. A denim miniskirt that you’ve only seen Emily wear a couple of times in the city, which you're certain she bought when she was a few inches shorter. And a strapless crop top that you only recall seeing her in when she went through a phase of sneaking out to parties to try and impress a boy.\n\n \n\n \"Slutty enough for you?\" she asks, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n You take off your clothes and put the outfit on. The skirt drops just below your buttocks. You know you are going to have to be careful standing up and sitting down. \n\n \n\n The crop top warrants you taking off your bra. You pull it over your shoulders and adjust it around your breasts, feeling your nipples rub against the fabric. You feel vulnerable with your stomach exposed.\n\n \n\n “If you are going all in, you might as well wear these,” Emily says, holding out a pair of heeled platform boots. “Just be careful not to fall and twist your leg.”\n\n \n\n You sit down on the bed, keeping your legs firmly squeezed together to avoid the ever-present threat of flashing. Once you’ve put on the boots, you stand. They are higher than you are used to wearing. You are surprised that your sister has taller heels than you.\n\n \n\n Emily adjusts your crop top, then takes a step and looks you up and down. “Dennis will be very happy,” she says flatly. “Anything else?”\n \n \n “We really need his help,” you tell your sister. “I think it needs to be something... a bit more sexy.”\n\n \n\n Emily stops what she’s doing and looks at you. “This is just about getting Dennis' help, right? You’re not looking forward to this, are you?”\n\n \n\n You snort. “Of course not.” But Emily’s narrowed eyes tell you that she doesn’t believe you. \n\n \n\n She turns back to the wardrobe and rummages in the back, where you can tell she stores things she doesn’t typically wear.

A denim miniskirt that you’ve only seen Emily wear a couple of times in the city, which you're certain she bought when she was a few inches shorter. And a strapless crop top that you only recall seeing her in when she went through a phase of sneaking out to parties to try and impress a boy.\n\n \n\n Looking back to Emily, you catch her judging eyes. “Do you mind?” you say quietly, motioning for her to turn around. She shakes her head, but does so.\n\n \n\n You take off your clothes and put the outfit on. The skirt drops just below your buttocks. You know you are going to have to be careful standing up and sitting down. \n\n \n\n The crop top warrants you taking off your bra. You pull it over your shoulders and adjust it around your breasts, feeling your nipples rub against the fabric. You feel vulnerable with your stomach exposed.\n\n \n\n “If you are going all in, you might as well wear these,” Emily says, holding out a pair of heeled platform boots. “Just be careful not to fall and twist your leg.”\n\n \n\n You sit down on the bed, keeping your legs firmly squeezed together to avoid the ever-present threat of flashing. Once you’ve put on the boots, you stand, taking a moment to adjust to the heels and moving around in them.\n\n \n\n Emily adjusts your crop top, then takes a step and looks you up and down. “Dennis will be very happy,” she says flatly. “Anything else?”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \"I just couldn’t write those horrible lines in class” you try. “But I’m sorry.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily stares at you, arms still crossed, and exhales slowly. “*You* couldn’t?” she repeats, voice tight. “I have to do that everyday, . I don't get a choice. And you don't if you're me, either.”\n\n \n\n She rubs her temples, clearly frustrated. “You don’t have to mean it. You just write the stupid lines and move on.”\n\n \n\n There’s a pause, and then she shakes her head, her frustration bleeding into something else. Concern. “You do realize this town doesn’t forget, right? You think Prichard’s just going to let this go? She'll be watching me closely from now on.\"\n\n \n\n \"I'm sorry, Em,\" you try. \"I just couldn't do it.\"\n\n \n\n Your sister stares hard at you, then sighs. \"I get it. It's demeaning. I know.\"\n\n \n\n She looks away for a moment, chewing on her lip. “What happens next time, though?” she mutters, her voice quieter now. “When I walk into class, and I don’t even know what I did? If you're going to pretend to be me, a little heads-up would be nice.”\n\n \n\n \"You're right,\" you reply. \"I should have told you.\"\n\n \n\n She lets out a breath, rubbing her arms before finally looking back at you. “Just… don’t make this a habit,” she mutters, softer now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily lets out a soft laugh, her frustration vanishing in an instant. “That’s what this is about?” She leans back against the cushions, shaking her head. “You really thought that was worth detention?”\n\n \n\n She gives you an almost pitying look. “Look, Prichard expects you to fall in line. You don’t have to mean it. You just do it, and she’ll leave you alone.”\n\n \n\n Her fingers toy with a strand of her hair as she smirks. “Honestly, you made it way harder on yourself than it had to be. And that makes things harder on me.”\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, her amusement draining from her face. “Next time, don’t make things so complicated. Just do the exercise, pass my lessons and don't make my life harder because you have a crisis of conscience.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at your sister, but she looks away, clearly done with this conversation.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"It’s just detention,” you say. “It's all part of the plan, Em. Don’t make a big deal out of it.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily lets out an incredulous scoff. “Oh, sure, it’s just detention,” she snaps. “Except now I have to deal with the consequences of *your* choices.”\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, standing up and pacing slightly. “I don’t want to be on her bad side. She remembers things. She holds grudges.” Her voice lowers slightly. “You don’t have to deal with that. *I* do.”\n\n \n\n She exhales through her nose, looking down for a moment before meeting your gaze again. “If you want to pick fights with teachers, fine,” she says, her voice quieter but firm. “But don’t drag me into it.”\n\n \n\n Her words feel less like an order and more like a quiet plea.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily laughs, rolling her eyes. “Yeah, exactly,” she says easily. “Who cares? It’s just detention.”\n\n \n\n She stretches her arms above her head, completely relaxed. “But next time, just avoid it. Just smile at her, tell her what she wants to hear or do what she says, and move on.”\n\n \n\n To your surprise, Emily then winks. “You’d be amazed at how easy people are to handle when you give them exactly what they expect.”\n\n \n\n She watches you for a moment, tilting her head. “You really should try it sometime,” she adds, almost teasing. “It’s way easier.”\n\n \n\n Her words are light and playful. But the ease with which she says it makes something in your stomach twist.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You take a breath, keeping your voice steady. \"I had to get close to them. They know things about the school. This was the best way.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily stares at you, her frustration twisting into something more like disbelief. “You had to?” she repeats, voice tight. “You had to parade me around like some Charlton doll just to dig up dirt on the cheerleaders?”\n\n \n\n She lets out a short, bitter laugh, shaking her head. “Do you know what Christina and her little clones are like? They talk so much about, like, ‘sisterhood’ and ‘teamwork,’ but the second you don’t match their exact vibe, you’re out. And they don’t just ignore you. They ruin you.”\n\n \n\n She exhales sharply, rubbing her temples. “And now, thanks to you, I’m in. At least as far as they’re concerned. I’m supposed to sit at their table, act like I care about their stupid designer bags, laugh at their awful jokes. And if I don’t? I become their next favorite joke.”\n\n \n\n Her voice dips slightly, her fingers gripping the back of the couch. “I can’t let that happen. Which means I have to play along.” She fixes you with a hard stare. “So congratulations. You just signed me up for months of pretending to give a damn.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily lets out an amused laugh, shaking her head. “Ohhh, so you had a plan.” She leans back against the cushions, stretching her arms above her head. “And here I thought you just wanted to have a little fun.”\n\n \n\n She waves a hand dismissively. “Honestly? Who cares about all that? Britney, Chrissie - they’re everything in Charlton. And I’m in. That’s what matters.”\n\n \n\n She grins, her excitement bubbling over. “I used to think you were such a stick-in-the-mud, but look at you.” She giggles, shaking her head. “You actually came through for me.”\n\n \n\n She wriggles on the couch, stretching slightly before turning back to you. “Can’t wait to get out onto that pitch,” she purrs, practically glowing. “The boys are going to love it.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n Your stomach twists as you meet her gaze. \"I didn’t really think about what it meant for you,\" you admit. \"I just did it.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily lets out a sharp, incredulous laugh. “You didn’t think about it?” She presses a hand to her forehead. “You...” She stops herself, inhaling slowly before exhaling through her nose.\n\n \n\n For a second, she just stares at you, like she’s trying to understand. “Do you get what you just did?” she asks, her voice quieter now. “You didn’t just sign me up for some dumb after-school club. You made me one of them.”\n\n \n\n She gestures vaguely, frustration bubbling up again. “Britney, Christina, all of them. The girls who walk around acting like their shoes are worth more than people’s lives. The girls who laugh at anyone who doesn’t fit their little picture-perfect idea of Charlton.”\n\n \n\n Her voice softens slightly, but it doesn’t make it any less painful. “And now, I’m one of them.” She swallows, her shoulders dropping just a little.\n\n \n\n “You want to know what the worst part is?” She lets out a small, exhausted laugh. “The boys. I already know what’s coming. The attention, the flirting, the expectations.” She shakes her head. “They’re going to see me differently now. And I can’t stop it.”\n\n \n\n You step forward, your voice low but sincere. “I’m so sorry, Emily. I got carried away. I wasn’t thinking about you, just… what I needed to do. I won’t make a decision like that again. As you.”\n\n \n\n Emily closes her eyes for a moment before sighing, finally meeting your gaze again. “Just… don’t do something like this again,” she mutters. “I know you didn’t mean to screw me over. But think next time, okay?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily blinks at you, then smirks, tilting her head. “Really? Because I think you do.” She lets out a small, incredulous giggle, shaking her head. “I think you know exactly what it meant for me. You're just not willing to admit that you wanted it, too?”\n\n \n\n She crosses her arms, studying you. “You saw them. The way they get treated. And you got up there and felt the eyes on you. The attention. The power.”\n\n \n\n She leans forward slightly, her voice dropping. “You wanted a taste of it. Of being them. Because they’re everything in Charlton. And you liked it.”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"That's not it at all, Em. I just took advantage of the situation.\"\n\n \n\n She turns her nose up as she flicks her hair over her shoulder. “Now that concerns me. You might have done right this time, . But what happens next time if your little flight of fancy goes against the grain. Are you going to cozy up to Heather Oats next, too?\"\n\n \n\n You step forward, your voice low but sincere. “I’m so sorry, Emily. I got carried away. I wasn’t thinking about you, just… what I needed to do. I won’t make a decision like that again. As you.”\n\n \n\n She purses her lips. “See you don't. You don’t get how Charlton works. I do. Britney, Christina, the squad. They matter. So, here’s the deal: stay out of things at school that don't concern you. This is *my* shot. *My* future. Not yours.”\n \n\n She leans back, completely at ease. “So don’t mess it up for me.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You exhale, rubbing the back of your neck. \"It was the curse,\" you admit. \"I was trying to do the work, but I couldn’t focus. I could barely keep my eyes open. It was like something was pulling me under. Everything felt hard, even when I was trying my best.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily lets out a sharp breath, rubbing her arms as she processes what you just said. “That’s… stupid,” she mutters, shaking her head. “You should be fine at maths. It’s your thing.”\n\n \n\n She exhales, running a hand through her hair. “So it wasn’t just that you forgot how to do it?” she asks, her tone still edged with irritation. “You were trying - but it didn’t work?”\n\n \n\n You nod. Her voice drops slightly, some of the anger fading into something more thoughtful. “That’s actually… kind of awful.”\n\n \n\n She looks away for a second, then sighs. “I know what it’s like to sit there, knowing you’re supposed to get something, but nothing clicks.”\n\n \n\n She rubs her arms, her frustration shifting into something more subdued. “Just… try to avoid it in the future, okay?” Her voice is quieter now, concern peeking through. “You don’t need to put yourself through that again.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily stares at you for a second before suddenly bursting into laughter. “Oh my God,” she gasps, clutching her stomach. “You... you really couldn’t do maths?”\n\n \n\n She wipes a tear from the corner of her eye, still giggling. “Man, I bet you loved that. Once top of your class, university prodigy, fumbling through equations like some clueless airhead.”\n\n \n\n She leans in slightly, eyes gleaming. “You talk a good game, . About how you can use your big brain to get ahead of Charlton.” Her smirk fades slightly. “But if you can’t even handle maths anymore, then what’s the point of you going to school as me, at all?”\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, an eyebrow raised in curiosity. “Honestly, I don’t even care about this curse anymore. But if you’re too busy floundering in my classes to actually pass, maybe it’s time you stop.”\n\n \n\n Her smile sharpens. “And if I need to take Rogers up on those extra lessons?” She shrugs. “Well, Michelle doesn’t seem to mind the attention. Maybe I won’t either.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You take a breath and meet her gaze. \"I needed to get into the Maths room alone,\" you say. \"There’s something wrong with it. I had to investigate.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily’s expression flickers, her frustration twisting into something more controlled. “You needed to get into the Maths room?” she repeats slowly, voice cautious.\n\n \n\n Then her expression hardens. “So you got me detention, just so you could snoop around?”\n\n \n\n She crosses her arms, her nails digging lightly into her sleeves. “You really don’t think things through, do you?” Her voice is quieter now, but there’s an edge to it. “Rogers already gives me too much attention as it is.”\n\n \n\n She exhales sharply, glancing toward the window. “I don’t know what Michelle does in those extra lessons,” she mutters, her voice lower now. “But I don’t want to find out the hard way.”\n\n \n\n For a second, she looks like she might say more. But then she stops, lips pressing into a thin line. Whatever’s on her mind, she’s not about to share it.\n\n \n\n She exhales, shifting slightly. “You keep saying you’re trying to figure out what’s going on.” She lifts her chin slightly, fixing you with a tired look. “Then just… figure it out. Stop making my life harder in the process.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily raises an eyebrow, then lets out a soft, knowing hum. “Ohhh,” she purrs. “So that’s what you were up to.”\n\n \n\n She leans forward slightly, intrigued. “Honestly? Smart.” She flashes a grin. “You needed information, so you made an opportunity for yourself. It's not like anyone at school really cares about me getting detention. Some of the boys probably find it appealing.”\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, her smile growing. “It’s about time you started thinking like me.”\n\n \n\n There’s no irritation, no concern. Instead, she’s studying you, almost approvingly.\n\n \n\n She stretches, letting out a slow, satisfied sigh. “And detention doesn’t matter anyway. Rogers will get over it.” Her smile curves slightly, a glint of amusement in her eyes. “And if I do have to spend some evenings with him because of you… well. That just may be a bonus.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You sigh and lean against the counter. \"I need to get access to the Business Studies room. This is the best way to do it.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily exhales sharply, shaking her head. “Are you serious?”\n\n \n\n She paces slightly, rubbing her arms. “Do you know what DeBussy does with what she learns?” Her voice lowers slightly. “I’ve seen it. Someone lets something slip, and suddenly, she’s got them.” She presses her lips together. “She finds out about family problems, grades slipping, secret relationships. Then she uses them. And now you are sitting in that club, handing her exactly what she wants.”\n\n \n\n Her voice drops even further, her arms tightening around herself. “It’s not just random people, you know. It’s my friends.” There’s a flicker of something raw in her expression. “People I sit with every day. People who trust me.”\n\n \n\n She looks at you again, something uncertain in her eyes. “I know you think this is important. But is it that important?” Her voice is quieter now, almost pleading. “Is finding out what’s happening worth hurting people?”\n\n \n\n She stares back at you for a moment, then looks away. “I thought you were better than that.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily watches you for a moment, then grins. “Now you’re starting to think like someone who actually wants to win.”\n\n \n\n She stretches, leaning back against the couch. “You’re right, of course. There’s no better way to get into that room. And DeBussy? She loves a little informant.”\n\n \n\n Then, after a pause, she tilts her head. “If you do learn anything juicy?” She flashes a smirk. “I wouldn’t mind hearing about it, too.”\n\n \n\n She taps a finger against the magazine in her lap. “You’ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelet, right?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n Your jaw tightens slightly. \"No. I wouldn’t do that.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily exhales slowly, some of the tension leaving her shoulders. “Good,” she mutters, rubbing her temples.\n\n \n\n She finally looks up at you, something softer in her expression. “You don’t get how dangerous she is,” she says, her voice quieter now. “DeBussy gets people tangled up in her web, and once you’re in, you don’t get out.”\n\n \n\n Her arms remain folded, but there’s no frustration anymore - just relief. “I don’t care what you’re doing in that club. But I’m glad you’re not going to throw anyone under the bus for it.”\n\n \n\n She watches you for a moment longer before sighing. “Just… be careful. Especially with DeBussy. She can make even the smartest person bend to her will.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily’s smirk fades, her brows pulling together slightly. “You’re kidding.”\n\n \n\n She lets out a sharp breath, rolling her eyes. “You had a way in. A way to get easy leverage, and you’re not going to use it?”\n\n \n\n She scoffs, shaking her head. “God, you still don’t get it, do you?” She leans forward slightly, her gaze hardening. “People make their own messes. If a little secret wrecks them, that’s their fault for letting it get out.”\n\n \n\n She exhales, clicking her tongue against her teeth. “But no, no, of course you have to be all noble about it.” Her voice turns mocking. “Can’t risk stepping on anyone’s delicate little feelings.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes flick toward you, assessing. “You should really start thinking about us instead of everyone else,” she mutters. “For once.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You hesitate, shifting under her gaze.\n\n \n\n \"Emily, I didn’t mean for this to happen.\" You sigh, rubbing a hand over your face. \"I got carried away. I --\" You shake your head. \"I shouldn’t have done that.\"\n\n \n\n Her lips press into a thin line. \"So you did do something.\"\n\n \n\n You swallow. \"I pushed Michelle into something she didn’t want to do. She didn’t take it well.\"\n\n \n\n Emily exhales sharply, arms crossing tight. \"She was my only friend. The only person I had left, and you...\" Her voice catches. \"You took that away from me.\"\n\n \n\n You step closer, voice low. \"I know. And I hate that I hurt you.\"\n\n \n\n She won’t look at you, but her fingers grip her sleeves.\n\n \n\n \"Emily,\" you add. “You’re the one of the few things that matters to me. I’m doing this for you. But I went too far. I’m sorry. You mean the world to me.\"\n\n \n\n Her shoulders tense, then slowly relax. \"At least you’re admitting it,\" she mutters.\n\n \n\n A pause, then a sharp sigh. \"Maybe she’ll come around. Just… don’t do this again, okay?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You let out a slow breath.\n\n \n\n \"I pushed her too far. I made her do something she didn’t want to do, and she resented me for it.\" You shake your head, voice quieter now. \"I was careless. I didn’t think about what it would mean for you.\"\n\n \n\n Emily listens, eyes half-lidded, like she’s waiting for something.\n\n \n\n \"I’m sorry,\" you say finally.\n\n \n\n A beat of silence. \n\n \n \n Then she laughs. \"God, .\" She shakes her head, smirking. \"You’re apologizing? For Michelle?\"\n\n \n\n \"You do realize she’s been sleeping her way up the Maths ladder, right? Everyone knew it. And now she’s suddenly upset that it blew up in her face?\"\n\n \n\n Her gaze sharpens as she leans forward slightly, the amusement in her tone giving way to something more pointed. “I can’t keep hanging out with a social pariah. And if you are going to continue being me, you’re going to have to stop with this sentimental guilt.” She gestures vaguely with a flick of her fingers. \"It makes me look weak.\"\n\n \n\n She clicks the TV on, her attention already shifting away. She’s done with this conversation.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n Emily’s brows furrow as you step closer, voice measured.\n\n \n\n \"Emily, I didn’t want to say anything, but… Michelle wasn’t who you thought she was.\"\n\n \n\n She stiffens slightly. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n You take another breath, reversing the energy to continue the lie. \"She was talking about you behind your back. Saying things. Really awful things.\"\n\n \n\n Her throat bobs, uncertainty flickering across her face. \"No.\" But her voice wavers. \"She wouldn’t -\"\n\n \n\n \"I wouldn’t lie to you about this.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily’s breath catches, her fingers tightening around her sleeves.\n\n \n\n \"No.\" Her voice is suddenly firm, steady. \"You’re lying. You just want to make yourself feel better.\"\n\n \n\n Her gaze hardens, something breaking between you in real-time.\n\n \n\n \"I thought I could trust you.\"\n\n \n\n She turns her head, looking away from you, signalling this conversation is over.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily doesn’t react right away. She just exhales, slow and controlled, tilting her head in thought.\n\n \n\n Then, after a long pause, she smirks. \"Figures.\"\n\n \n\n She scoffs lightly, shaking her head. \"This is Charlton, after all. Half the girls here would shove their best friend under a bus if it meant getting ahead.\"\n\n \n\n Her gaze flickers back to you, something calculating in her expression. \"Looks like you’re looking out for me, after all.\"\n\n \n\n She taps a finger against her thigh, considering. \"Guess I’ll have to find a new best friend.\" A slow, knowing smirk. \"Shouldn’t be too hard.\"\n\n \n\n She turns to the kitchen table and picks up a magazine, already losing interest in the conversation.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You exhale, crossing your arms as you meet Emily’s gaze. \"I needed to get into the AV cupboard.\"\n\n \n\n Her brows lift slightly, waiting for you to continue.\n\n \n\n \"So I persuaded him that it was in his best interests to give me his key.\" You shrug, keeping your tone even. \"Or everyone would find out what he’s been up to.\"\n\n \n\n Emily frowns. \"And what exactly has Dennis been up to?\"\n\n \n\n You hesitate for a beat before answering. \"Taking pictures of girls without their knowledge. Being a creep.\"\n\n \n\n Her expression shifts. Not immediately angry, but processing.\n\n \n\n \"I did what needed to be done.\"\n\n \n Emily’s frown deepens, her lips pressing into a tight line.\n\n \n\n \"That’s not for you to decide.\"\n\n \n\n She leans forward, setting her book aside. \"I don’t care if Dennis is weird, or even if he is a creep. That doesn’t give you the right to treat him like dirt.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice lowers, her gaze searching yours. \"You’re acting as me, remember? So it’s not you being mean. It’s me. And I don’t treat people like that.\"\n\n \n\n She exhales, shaking her head. \"People in this school are already cruel enough. You don’t need to add to it.\"\n\n \n\n She stands up abruptly, rubbing a hand over her face as she walks past you. \"I don’t want to talk about this anymore.\"\n\n \n\n The disappointment in her voice lingers long after she’s gone.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily snorts, setting her magazine aside.\n\n \n\n \"So, he finally got what was coming to him.\"\n\n \n\n She swings her legs over the edge of the sofa, stretching leisurely. \"Honestly, I always knew he was up to something. Charlton has its fair share of creeps. It’s about time someone put at least one of them in their place.\"\n\n \n\n There’s no sympathy in her voice. No hesitation. Just quiet approval.\n\n \n\n She smirks, tapping her nails against the arm of the couch.\n\n \n\n \"I like this side of you, .\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You practice your best sympathetic grimace, before looking at Emily directly. \"I called him out for his hobby. Told him how creepy it was.\"\n\n \n\n Emily tilts her head, watching you carefully and waiting for you to continue.\n\n \n\n \"The photos he takes,\" you clarify. \"Of girls. Without them knowing. You know he puts his camera in private places, don't you?\"\n\n \n \n \n Emily's nose rolls with disgust. She sighs again. \"It's gross.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, feeling emboldened by her reaction to your lie. \"That's what I thought. And I couldn't let it pass without saying something.\"\n\n \n\n Watching Emily, you see the conflict on her face. She seems to be studying you. \"I guess that's only right,\" she says after a moment. \"But I don't like the thought of you doing things as me without asking first.\"\n\n \n\n \"You would have preferred I didn't say anything?\" you ask her, letting a degree of frustration creep into your voice. Inwardly, you note a sense of pride in your performance.\n\n \n\n Her voice lowers, her gaze searching yours. \"You’re acting as me, remember? So it’s not you doing things. It’s me. So just be careful with your chivalry. People tend to notice that at Charlton.\"\n\n \n\n \"Noted,\" you reply, offering an apologetic smile. \"I'll be careful.\"\n\n \n\n She nods. \"Thank you.\"\n\n \n\n She returns back to her books, satisfied with your lie.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily snorts and chuckles to herself. \"Finally finding your balls as a girl, ?\"\n\n \n\n She swings her legs over the edge of the sofa, looking up at you with a grin. \"Maybe if girls are calling him out now, he'll think twice about taking more photos. Thanks, \"\n\n \n\n You only reply with a polite smile, not wishing to press your win further than necessary. She seems to be mulling something over as she watches you.\n\n \n\n \"In fact, maybe I'll have a chat to Jake,\" she says finally. \"It might take a real man to knock some sense into him. No offense.\"\n\n \n\n She titters, turning her attention back to her nails. Lost in thoughts that bring a smirk to her face. And your own mind dwells on her final comment, pondering exactly what she meant.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You sigh deeply, the guilt setting in. \"I needed a hall pass from him. To investigate the boy's lessons.\"\n\n \n\n Emily narrows her eyes. \"What did you say?\"\n\n \n\n You hesitate, choosing your words carefully. \"Just that if he didn't speak to Harrow about getting me a hall pass, I'd tell everyone about the photos he’s been taking of girls.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s eyes narrow further. \"Blackmail?\"\n\n \n\n You shrug. \"He kind of deserved it.\"\n\n \n \n \n Emily’s expression hardens. \"That's not the point,\" she mutters. \"I don't care how much of a creep he is. You shouldn't act like everyone else does in this town.\"\n\n \n\n You hear the tone of your voice grow defensive. \"You think it's okay what he's been doing?\"\n\n \n\n \"Of course not!\" she retorts, matching your tone. \"But that doesn't give you the right to bully him. There's plenty of other people at school who deserve to be treated worse. You're just picking on him because he can't fight back.\"\n\n \n\n \"I can't believe you're defending him!\" you spit.\n\n \n\n Emily's nose turns up, almost snarling. \"Oh please,\" she replies. \"You don't care about what he's done. You're just using it to justify you being like... one of them.\"\n\n \n\n Silence sets in, but Emily doesn't look away. Only after a long moment does she break the tension by taking a deep breath and closing her eyes.\n\n \n\n \"Don't become like everyone else, . What's the point in us doing all of this if we're just going to blend in anyway.\"\n\n \n\n Without looking back at you she turns back to her books, leaving you standing there.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily lets out a sharp cackle. \"He's just a loser,\" she spits. \"I don't blame you for taking advantage of that.\"\n\n \n\n You give her a look, conflicted between winning Emily to your side and hearing this tone from your sister. \"I didn't enjoy it.\"\n\n \n\n That makes her raise an eyebrow. \"Oh really? Come on, . Tell me there wasn't a rush inside as you watched his face fold. He must have been heartbroken. He fancies you, you know?\"\n\n \n\n \"What?\" you can't help but yelp back.\n\n \n\n \"I mean, us,\" she clarifies. \"Me. Honestly it gets so hard to keep all this clear in your head.\" She leans back against the sofa, her smirk widening. \"Don't you agree?\"\n\n \n\n When you shift awkwardly, she titters. Her eyes sparkle with something familiar. You recognise the cause immediately - the power of your carefully chosen words. *Like blackmail.*\n\n \n\n She returns to looking at her nails, seemingly done with the conversation. \"Good work,\" she mutters.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You sigh, rubbing the back of your neck. \"I didn’t mean to make things worse for you.\"\n\n \n\n Emily tilts her head slightly, watching you with quiet expectation. She doesn’t answer right away, waiting.\n\n \n\n You exhale. \"I needed to get into the AV cupboard. So I made Dennis give me his key. I told him that if he didn’t, everyone would find out about the photos he’s been taking of girls.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s lips part slightly, her brows knitting together.\n\n \n\n \"You blackmailed him?\"\n\n \n\n Her voice isn’t immediately angry. It’s more measured, like she’s still trying to decide how she feels about it.\n\n \n\n You shift under her gaze. \"I didn’t think it would be that big of a deal. He’s the one doing something wrong.\"\n\n \n\n Her fingers tap lightly against her arm, silent for a moment before she exhales. \"And now he’s furious with me, because of what you've done in my place.\"\n\n \n\n \"I'm sorry,\" you try again. \"What can I do to fix it?\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily’s expression softens, and for a moment, she just watches you. The disappointment lingers, but so does something else that almost looks like hope.\n\n \n\n \"Just... be better.\"\n\n \n\n She crosses her arms, glancing away. \"There aren’t enough people in this school who actually consider how others feel. And I don’t want you turning into them.\"\n\n \n\n Emily sighs, rubbing at her arm. \"Dennis is awkward, yeah. But that doesn’t mean he deserved to be treated badly. Just...\" She hesitates, then looks at you again. \"Please don’t be like everyone else here. Charlton’s already got enough people like that.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice drops slightly. \"Just be better.\"\n\n \n\n You meet her gaze, nodding. \"Yeah. I promise.\"\n\n \n\n Her shoulders loosen, her lips pressing into something close to a smile.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily lets out a sharp laugh, shaking her head.\n\n \n\n \"Fix it? , what exactly do you think needs fixing?\"\n\n \n\n She leans back against the sofa, her smirk widening. \"You got Dennis to do us a favor, whether he wanted to or not. Nothing to fix.\"\n \n\n Her expression flattens, amusement giving way to something colder.\n\n \n\n \"If you keep second-guessing yourself like this, people are going to start seeing me as weak.\" She tilts her head, her eyes narrowing slightly. \"And that’s not a good look for me.\"\n\n \n\n She picks up her magazine again, flicking to a new page with a decisive snap.\n\n \n\n \"Don’t make a habit of this whole... guilt thing, . It’s not very becoming.\"\n\n \n\n With that, she doesn’t even glance up again, the conversation effectively over.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You hesitate, then exhale, rubbing the back of your neck. \"Yeah,\" you admit. \"I might have… said something to her.\"\n\n \n\n Emily raises an eyebrow. \"What did you do?\"\n\n \n\n You shift your weight slightly, trying to frame it in the best possible way. \"I needed the gym key. So I, uh… persuaded her.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s expression sharpens. \"Persuaded her?\"\n\n \n\n You clear your throat. \"I had some photos of her. In the gym. Cleaning.”\n\n \n\n Emily frowns, inviting you to continue. “She doesn’t clean fully clothed, if you know what I mean. And I told her that if she didn’t help me, well… you know other people would see them.\"\n\n \n\n There’s a beat of silence. Emily stares at you, unblinking. \"You blackmailed her.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice isn’t angry at first. Just flat. Disbelieving. She exhales sharply, sitting up straighter. \"You do remember that’s exactly what that school does to its students, right? It forces people to do things they don’t want to do. And now you’re doing the same thing.\"\n\n \n\n You don’t respond, feeling the tension hanging in the air.\n\n \n\n \"Heather already has to play by the school's rules,” Emily continues, anger now in her voice. “And now she has to play by yours too? Jesus, .\"\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, eyes dark with disappointment.\n\n \n\n \"I can’t believe you’ve become that person.\"\n\n \n\n She doesn’t wait for your response. She just stands, grabs her tea, and heads upstairs without another word.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You hesitate, then exhale, rubbing the back of your neck. \"Yeah,\" you admit. \"I might have… said something to her.\"\n\n \n\n Emily raises an eyebrow. \"What did you do?\"\n\n \n\n You shift your weight slightly, trying to frame it in the best possible way. \"I needed the gym key. So I, uh… persuaded her.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s expression sharpens. \"Persuaded her?\"\n\n \n\n You clear your throat. \"I had some photos of her. In the gym.

And I told her that if she didn’t help me, well… you know other people would see them.\"\n\n \n\n There’s a beat of silence. Then, to your surprise, she actually laughs. \"So that’s what’s got her all twitchy?\" \n\n \n\n She leans back against the sofa, smirking. \"Heather got herself into that situation. If she didn’t want to be blackmailed, she shouldn’t have been in that gym. Doing that.\"\n\n \n\n You say nothing, studying your sister carefully.\n\n \n\n \"There are other ways to get out of punishment at Charlton,\" she continues. \"But Heather is too timid to look after herself. And now she’s facing the consequences for it.\"\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, looking at you with something close to approval.\n\n \n\n \"Good work, .\"\n\n \n\n She returns to looking at her nails, completely unbothered.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You shake your head. \"I have no idea what Heather’s problem is.\"\n\n \n\n Emily studies you carefully. \"She wouldn’t even look at me,\" she re-iterates. \"I’ve never had a conversation with her in my life, and suddenly, she acts like I’m radioactive.\"\n\n \n\n You shrug, keeping your expression neutral. \"She’s always been timid,\" you say. \"Maybe she’s just struggling recently.\"\n\n \n\n Emily narrows her eyes slightly. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n \n\n Your mind races, trying to expand upon your throw-away lie. \n\n \n\n \"I’ve just… noticed things,\" you say quickly. \"She’s shy to the point of paralysis. She probably has a ton of anxiety. Maybe she’s having a bad week. Or a bad month.\"\n\n \n\n You pause, then add gently: \"You need to give her some leniency, Em.\"\n\n \n\n Emily blinks, considering. After a moment, she nods.\n\n \n\n \"Maybe you’re right,\" she mutters, exhaling. \"I mean, I don’t know what’s going on with her.\"\n\n \n\n She leans back into the sofa. \"You’re kind to think about what she might be going through.\"\n\n \n\n You force a small smile, as she gives you a warm smile as she looks at you with admiration. \"I won’t take it personally, then.\"\n\n \n\n You can only nod. She believes you. And she’s impressed at how much support you’re showing Heather and her issues. \n\n \n\n Even if you’ve made them up entirely.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You shake your head. \"I have no idea what Heather’s problem is.\"\n\n \n\n Emily studies you carefully. \"She wouldn’t even look at me,\" she re-iterates. \"I’ve never had a conversation with her in my life, and suddenly, she acts like I’m radioactive.\"\n\n \n\n You shrug, keeping your expression neutral. \"She’s always been timid,\" you say. \"Maybe she’s just struggling recently.\"\n\n \n\n Emily narrows her eyes slightly. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n \n\n Your mind races, trying to expand upon your throw-away lie. \n\n \n\n \"I’ve just… noticed things,\" you say quickly. \"She’s shy to the point of paralysis.

Or a bad month.\"\n\n \n\n You pause, then add gently: \"You need to give her some leniency, Em.\"\n\n \n\n Emily stares back at you for a moment. Then laughs. It’s not her usual laugh. It’s sharp. Almost mocking.\n\n \n\n \"What? You’re blaming it on issues?\"\n\n \n\n You shrug, keeping your expression neutral. \"She’s shy to the point of paralysis. She must have tremendous anxiety. She probably has bad days. Or weeks.\"\n\n \n\n Emily rolls her eyes. \"Sounds like she’s just weak.\"\n\n \n\n You blink, struggling to digest what she’s just said.\n\n \n\n Emily tilts her head, smirking slightly. \"People who can’t handle pressure don’t deserve a break, . That’s just how it works. She’ll either learn how to survive, or she’ll get eaten alive.\"\n\n \n\n She leans forward slightly, her voice softer but pointed.\n\n \n\n \"And you? You need to learn that, too.\"\n\n \n\n There’s something unsettling about how calmly she says it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You exhale slowly and move to sit next to her. Emily flinches back slightly. She doesn’t move away. But she doesn’t lean in, either.\n\n \n\n Taking a deep breath, you start talking. \"I learned from Heather that Beach gives a key to regular losers in PE. So they can clean the gym after lessons. I failed PE on purpose to get close to him. To get the key. And things got carried away.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s breath catches. She stares at you in horror. “You… slept with him?”\n\n \n\n “No!” you spit out. “Not that.” After seeing her continuing look, you add. “Something else.” \n\n \n\n You remember back to your encounter with Beach. Too late you realise that you’re running your tongue over your lips. Emily instantly reacts with revulsion. \n\n \n\n “That’s…” she tries. “I can’t.”\n\n \n\n Silence hangs in the air. You wait for her to look back at you. But she doesn’t, rubbing her face with her hands.\n\n \n\n “I can’t believe what I’m hearing,” she says, still not meeting your eyes. “It’s bad enough that you failed one of my lessons on purpose. The whole reason I gave you the amulet was to help my studies.” \n\n \n\n Her shoulders tremble. She finally looks back to you. Her brown eyes cold. \"And you’ve done that with one of my teachers?”\n\n \n\n She laughs, a bitter, broken sound. \"Did you even think about what that would mean for me? Do you even care about me anymore?\"\n\n \n\n You press your lips together. \"I did it to get access to the gym. To help rid you of these curses.\"\n\n \n\n Emily shakes her head and stands abruptly. \"I don’t believe you anymore. You’re disgusting. I don’t know what’s happened to you, but I can't even look at you anymore.\"\n\n \n\n She walks away.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You exhale slowly and move to sit next to her. Emily flinches back slightly. She doesn’t move away. But she doesn’t lean in, either.\n\n \n\n Taking a deep breath, you start talking. \"I learned from Heather that Beach gives a key to regular losers in PE. So they can clean the gym after lessons. I failed PE on purpose to get close to him. To get the key. And things got carried away.\"\n\n \n\n Emily leans back, crossing her legs. Her brows narrow. “You fucked him, didn’t you?”\n\n \n\n “No!” you spit out. “Not that.” After seeing her continuing look, you add. “Something else.”\n\n \n\n You remember back to your encounter with Beach. Too late you realise that you’re running your tongue over your lips. Emily snorts with derision.\n\n \n\n “You tramp,” she spits. \"Did you ever consider you’re risking my reputation with this type of behavior? What that would mean for me if people found out? Do you even care about my place in Charlton?\"\n\n \n\n You inhale. \"I did it to get access to the gym,\" you try.\n\n \n\n Emily laughs. \"I don’t believe you.\"\n\n \n\n You freeze, staring at her. A cruel grin spreads on her face. \"You’re starting to enjoy it, aren’t you? Being a submissive little girl. Sucking off your teachers like a cheap little slut.”\n\n \n\n The words catch you. You don’t know how to respond.\n\n \n\n Her smile fades, replaced only with disdain. \"But that’s not me. If you want to indulge in some student teacher fantasy, find a way to do it as yourself. But don’t risk ruining my life.\"\n\n \n\n She stands up. \"I have a future here. Unlike you.\"\n\n \n\n Emily walks off.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You exhale slowly and move to sit next to her. Emily flinches back slightly. She doesn’t move away. But she doesn’t lean in, either.\n\n \n\n Taking a deep breath, you start talking. \"I learned from Heather that Beach gives a key to regular losers in PE. So they can clean the gym after lessons. I failed PE on purpose to get close to him. To get the key. But nothing happened.\"\n\n \n\n Emily raises an eyebrow, almost hopeful. “Nothing?”\n\n \n\n “Nothing,” you lie.\n\n \n\n She takes a deep breath. You can sense some anger leaving her. \"Then why did Coach Beach say those things?\"\n\n \n\n You shrug. \"Because he’s a pervert. He’s just pushing his luck, Em. Look --\" You pull out the gym key and wave it in the air. \"I got what we needed. That’s the end of it.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s eyes flick between you and the key. She takes another deep breath, then relaxes, sinking deep into the sofa.\n\n \n\n \"I thought you…\" She shakes her head. \"Did something with one of my teachers. As me. I thought the school had gotten to you, too.\"\n\n \n\n You force a smile, trying to fake a laugh. “I wouldn’t do that, Em. I would never risk your reputation like that.”\n\n \n\n You lean towards her a little before continuing. “Hey, I’m sorry for failing your PE lesson on purpose. It was just a means to an end.”\n\n \n\n Emily nods, offering you a polite smile. “It’s okay,” she says quietly. “I forgive you. I’m just glad I was wrong.”\n\n \n\n She reaches over and squeezes your hand. \"I’m glad I’ve got you on my side.\"\n\n \n\n You smile at her, reassuring. She finally lets go and returns her attention elsewhere, picking up a magazine.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You exhale slowly and move to sit next to her. Emily flinches back slightly. She doesn’t move away. But she doesn’t lean in, either.\n\n \n\n Taking a deep breath, you start talking. \"I learned from Heather that Beach gives a key to regular losers in PE. So they can clean the gym after lessons. I failed PE on purpose to get close to him. To get the key. But nothing happened.\"\n\n \n\n Emily raises an eyebrow, a crooked smile lingering. “Nothing?”\n\n \n\n “Nothing,” you lie.\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, as she watches you. \"Then why did Beach say those things?\"\n\n \n\n You shrug. \"Because he’s a pervert. He’s just pushing his luck, Em. Look --\" You pull out the gym key and wave it in the air. \"I got what we needed. That’s the end of it.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s eyes flick between you and the key. She then smiles, sinking deep into the sofa.\n\n \n\n \"I’m impressed, . That’s how you do things around here. Tease, but don’t give in. Girls who don't understand that end up working at Dicks. Or worse.”\n\n \n\n You force a smile, trying to fake a laugh. “I wouldn’t do that, Em. I would never risk your reputation like that.”\n\n \n\n You lean towards her a little before continuing. “Hey, I’m sorry for failing your PE lesson on purpose. It was just a means to an end.”\n\n \n\n Emily laughs. “Oh I don’t care about that.” she replies. “Just keep it up. You’re doing a better job at being me than I do.\"\n\n \n\n She grins and picks up a magazine.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You take a breath. \"I needed to get closer to the cheerleaders,” you tell her. \"They might know something about the curse. But to get in with them, Christina demanded that I prove my place in the pecking order.\"\n\n \n\n Emily stares. She presses her fingers to her temples. \"So, let me get this straight. You publicly shamed my best friend… just to impress Christina?\"\n\n \n\n You pause for only a moment, then silently nod.\n\n \n\n She closes her eyes and sighs. \"Do you even hear yourself?\" she says, quietly.\n\n \n\n You open your mouth to respond, but she cuts you off. \"You’re becoming just like them.”\n\n \n\n “Christina and her friends ruin people for sport. They toy with them, humiliate them, make them feel worthless. And now, apparently, you’re doing it too.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes glisten, but she refuses to let herself cry. \"I don’t have any friends, . Michelle was the closest thing I had. And you just… ruined that.\"\n\n \n\n She stands abruptly, brushing past you without another word.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You take a breath. \"I needed to get closer to the cheerleaders,” you tell her. \"They might know something about the curse. But to get in with them, Christina demanded that I prove my place in the pecking order.\"\n\n \n\n Emily raises an eyebrow. There’s a hint of a smirk on her face. \"So, you put Michelle in her place?\"\n\n \n\n You pause for only a moment, then silently nod.\n\n \n\n She rolls her head around, clicking her neck. \"I have to say, … I’m impressed.\"\n\n \n\n You blink, caught off guard.\n\n \n\n \"You know,” she continues. “I never really considered the benefits of having you in my life. But if you can do things like this? Maybe it’s not so bad, having you play me after all.\"\n\n \n\n Your stomach twists. She’s actually happy with your choice.\n\n \n\n \"Getting close to Christina is a great idea,\" Emily continues. \"She knows everything that happens in that school. And being in her circle? That’s where I belong. The in-crowd. It’s where I should have been from the start.\"\n\n \n\n She grins at you. \"And thanks to you, I’m finally there.\"\n\n \n\n She turns back to her magazine, as if nothing out of the ordinary happened at all. Leaving you standing there.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You take a breath. \"I had to, Em,” you tell her. \"It’s part of the plan to get close to the cheerleaders. To see what they know about the school and magic.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes flicker, daring you to go on.\n\n \n\n \"Like those girls said… I improved your social standing. Christina would have been impressed. She’ll accept you more now.\"\n\n \n\n Emily laughs once. Short, bitter, and disbelieving. \"Liz is the only reason we even know what’s really going on at Charlton, . And now she won’t speak to me. Never mind that she’s one of the few people who actually gives me the time of day. She was literally the only person I could talk to about everything that’s happening.\"\n\n \n\n She stares at you, expression unreadable. You have nothing to say to calm her down.\n\n \n\n Without a response, she rises off the sofa and walks towards the stairs. \n\n \n\n \"You’re ruining my life,” she says as she passes you. \n\n \n\n Moments later, you hear her bedroom door slam.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You take a breath. \"I had to, Em,” you tell her. \"It’s part of the plan to get close to the cheerleaders. To see what they know about the school and magic.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes flicker, daring you to go on.\n\n \n\n \"Like those girls said… I improved your social standing. Christina would have been impressed. She’ll accept you more now.\"\n\n \n\n Emily holds her stare for a moment longer, before a grin spreads on her face. \"You know… those girls were right.\"\n\n \n\n She leans back against the sofa, crossing her arms. \"Liz tries so hard with her outfits and makeup to stand out. But really? She’s just an outcast. Always has been. Always will be. She doesn’t have a future. She’ll just be on the edge for the rest of her life, trying to convince herself she’s in the right and everyone else is the problem.\"\n\n \n\n She smiles at you. \"I don’t need people like that in my life. She introduced us to magic. Now she’s outgrown her usefulness. You were right to use her to get closer to Christina and the cheerleaders. They are society, after all.\"\n\n \n\n She leans back into the sofa, opening her magazine again. \"Good work, ,” she mutters as she begins reading. “Keep it up.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You swallow hard. \"I needed the gym key,\" you say carefully. “And Jake wanted that to give it to me.”\n\n \n\n Emily scoffs. She shakes her head, eyes glistening. \"You did something like that… for a key?\"\n\n \n\n You don’t respond.\n\n \n\n Emily lets out a choked laugh, but there’s nothing funny about it. \"With Jake?\" Her voice rises slightly, cracking. \"God, he’s disgusting. And now he thinks I’m one of those girls.\"\n\n \n\n She runs a shaking hand through her hair. \"You could have found another way. But instead, you did… that?\"\n\n \n\n You nod. No words come to your lips. For a long moment, Emily stares back at you. \n\n \n\n Breaking the silence, finally, she exhales sharply. \"This town,\" she says, with measured frustration. “That school. Look what it’s doing to us. Look what it’s doing to you. Can you honestly tell me that two months ago, you would have even dreamed of doing something like that?\"\n\n \n\n The question hangs between you, suffocating. You have no answer.\n\n \n\n Emily stares at you for another second, then shakes her head.\n\n \n\n \"I don’t know you anymore.\"\n\n \n\n She turns and walks away.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You swallow hard. \"I needed the gym key,\" you say carefully. “And Jake wanted that to give it to me.”\n\n \n\n Emily laughs. Not mocking, not cruel. Just amused. \"You fooled around with him… for a key?\"\n\n \n\n She leans back the stair banister, studying you as she folds her arms. \"Wow. I can’t believe the thing in front of me is still my . Can you imagine two months ago you being such a slut?\"\n\n \n\n The last word stings. Emily’s eyes sparkle, as if she knows the weight of the word she used. \"You gave it away for something so small,\" she adds.\n\n \n\n “Emily, I --” you begin. But she cuts you off, her smile turning cold. \n\n \n\n \"Have you ever heard of Dicks?\"\n\n \n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n \"The girls at school talk about it,” she purrs. “A seedy place. Where drop-outs go after they run out of options. Maybe you should just give up on all of this. You clearly don’t mind selling yourself out for not much. Why not actually get paid for it?\"\n\n \n\n You stare at her, horrified. \n\n \n\n Her smirk fades. \"Just don’t do it as me anymore,\" she says, voice suddenly sharp. \"I still want my reputation to remain intact.\"\n\n \n\n She walks off, leaving you standing there.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You let out a slow breath. \"I don’t know why I did it,\" you admit. \"I just wanted to. He’s got a certain… appeal.\"\n\n \n\n Emily watches you carefully. Then her expression softens slightly. \"It’s starting to affect you too, isn’t it?\"\n\n \n\n You frown.\n\n \n\n \"The school,” she clarifies. “The curses. This town.\" She exhales, rubbing at her arm. \"Two months ago you wouldn’t have even dreamed of saying that. Let alone acting on it.”\n\n \n\n “I didn’t even consider that it would get to you too,\" she adds softly.\n\n \n\n You still say nothing. Meeting her eyes. Feeling your own tears forming. \n\n \n\n Emily sniffs, sucking in her emotions. \"I’m not going to forget what you did,\" she says. \"But I get it. All too well. Every day, there’s a draw. To do things. To behave in certain ways. It’s exhausting.\"\n\n \n\n She holds her look on your own glistening eyes. There’s understanding in there, beneath the betrayal and anguish. \n\n \n\n \"Maybe you should take a break from school,\" she murmurs. \"I can handle going for a couple of days.\"\n\n \n\n She meets your gaze, voice softer.\n\n \n\n \"Just… look after yourself, okay?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You let out a slow breath. \"I don’t know why I did it,\" you admit. \"I just wanted to. He’s got a certain… appeal.\"\n\n \n\n Emily watches you carefully. Then grins. \"You little minx.\"\n\n \n\n She laughs, shaking her head. \"I was wondering how you were adjusting, but now I see it. You’re starting to see the benefits of Charlton’s ways, aren’t you?\"\n\n \n\n You look up at your sister, trying to make sense of her words. There’s no irony there. She is being serious. \n\n \n\n \"A little charm,” she continues, her voice purring. “A little flirting. A few favors for the boys. It makes things so much easier than the grind. Why bother trying to be the best when you can just use what you’ve been naturally given?\"\n\n \n\n She taps a finger against her lips, considering. \"Maybe I should take Jake up on his offer. Sample him myself.\"\n\n \n\n She laughs again, shaking her head.\n\n \n\n \"You’re going to fit in here just fine, . Just make sure you're discreet.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You take a slow breath. You try not to look down at the photo.\n\n \n\n \"Olaf has access to everywhere in the school,\" you begin. \"He has a skeleton key to every room. So instead of wasting time trying to find another way, I convinced him to give it to me.\"\n\n \n\n Emily derisively laughs. \"Convinced him?\" Her fingers dig into the table, gesturing to the photo. \"Is this how you convinced him?\"\n\n \n\n You open your mouth, but she cuts you off. \"You’re abhorrent. Look at this.” She shoves the photo toward you. \"I look like a porn star. You let him see me like this.\"\n\n \n\n You try to reassure her. \"Olaf keeps the photos for his collection. They won’t get out.\"\n\n \n\n \"That’s not the point,” Emily snaps. She stands abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. \"He’s seen me like this. He’s seen everything. And you had no right to give him that.\"\n\n \n\n She clenches her jaw, letting the words hang in the air. When she speaks again, you note that her venom has been lessened, just a bit.\n\n \n\n \"I can’t even imagine what he does while he’s in his cot, looking at them. Or rather, I can. And I don't want to.\" \n\n \n\n Her shoulders tremble, but she looks at you summoning as much confidence as she can muster. \"My body --\" she swallows, voice tight, \"is not a doll for you to use. When you are me, you act as I would. That means no flaunting. No flirting. No posing for lurid photos. Got it?\"\n\n \n\n You can only nod. \n\n \n\n She inhales sharply, then shakes her head. \"I thought I didn’t need to tell you that,” she mutters. \"I thought you had more respect for me. Clearly, I was wrong.\"\n\n \n\n She walks off.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You take a slow breath. You try not to look down at the photo.\n\n \n\n \"Olaf has access to everywhere in the school,\" you begin. \"He has a skeleton key to every room. So instead of wasting time trying to find another way, I convinced him to give it to me.\"\n\n \n\n Emily slams her hand against the table. The photo crinkles beneath her palm. \"I don’t care if this would stop every single curse forever,\" she spits. She snatches the photo up, holding it between two fingers like it disgusts her. \"Look at this.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes blaze. \"I look like the school slut.\"\n\n \n\n She throws the photo onto the table. \"Do you have any idea what this would do to my reputation if people saw this?\"\n\n \n\n You try to explain. \"Olaf keeps the photos for himself. They won’t get out.\"\n\n \n\n Emily lets out a sharp laugh. \"You think things like this stay secret for long? Charlton is kill or be killed. If anyone sees that, my school life is ruined.\"\n\n \n\n You try again. \"I did it to help remove the curses --\"\n\n \n\n Emily cuts you by pushing her chair back, suddenly rising up to her feet. She leans over the table, scowling at you. \"I don’t care.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice is low, sharp. Dangerous. \"My body isn’t a plaything for your sick indulgence,\" she spits. \"Charlton only favors respectable girls. You’re not going to ruin that for me.\"\n\n \n\n She stares back at you, letting the words hang. Then a smile forms on her face. \"And if you do. If I end up a social pariah? Maybe that amulet will just go missing one of these days. While you’re me.\"\n\n \n\n You freeze. Her smile widens, sweet and venomous. \"Unless,” she says, pausing, as she pretends to mull something over. “I’ve heard rumors at school of a few places outside of town. Places where people pay for girls who act like that.\" She gestures to the photo. \"Maybe that’s the life you really want.\"\n\n \n\n She turns on her heel.\n\n \n\n \"But it’s not for me.\"\n\n \n\n She walks away.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You let out a sigh, taking a seat beside her. \"I'm sorry, Em. It was Christina. She wanted me to prove myself. Make it clear whose side I was on.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's eyes widen, disbelief flickering across her face. \"Whose side?\" she snaps. \"Jennifer isn't some random stranger. You deliberately hurt her just to impress Christina?\"\n\n \n\n \"I thought it was the only way to get close to Christina,\" you admit quietly. \"I didn't think Jen would take it this badly.\"\n\n \n\n Emily rises suddenly, her fists clenched in frustration. \"You didn't think at all! She’s practically family. What's going to happen next time she comes around? You expect me to fix this for you?\"\n\n \n\n You hesitate. \"Look, Jen will forgive us. Just apologise --\"\n\n \n\n Emily cuts you off sharply. \"I shouldn't be apologising. You should be making this right.\" She shakes her head, turning away. \"I can’t believe how short-sighted you're being.\"\n\n \n\n Without another word, she storms out, leaving you alone with the weight of what you've done.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You let out a sigh, taking a seat beside her. \"I'm sorry, Em. It was Christina. She wanted me to prove myself. Make it clear whose side I was on.\"\n\n \n\n Emily laughs aloud, clearly entertained by your candour. \"You actually did that? You chose Christina over Jennifer?\"\n\n \n\n \"I thought it was the only way to get close to Christina,\" you admit quietly. \"I didn't think Jen would take it this badly.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's eyes glitter approvingly. \"You know what? I agree. [Jennifer's cute / Jennifer’s nice], but she's replaceable. You should start looking at who else is available around town. Someone more useful.\"\n\n \n\n You arch an eyebrow. \"Like who?\"\n\n \n\n Emily smirks knowingly. \"Maybe Annie, that secretary at your work. She seems fun. Give it some thought. Decide if Jennifer is really the best choice for you.\"\n\n \n\n She turns away, picking up her phone with a satisfied smile. \"I'm impressed, by the way. Good job thinking what’s going to benefit us.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You hold Emily's gaze steadily, pushing down your guilt as you spin your explanation. \"Jen hasn't been herself lately,\" you say softly, feigning concern. \"She’s been distant and weird around me too, holding back and not talking about what's bothering her. Honestly, I don’t know what's up with her lately.\"\n\n \n\n Emily tilts her head, the hardness in her eyes softening into concern. \"Really? I hadn't noticed,\" she says, visibly relaxing as her suspicion shifts. \"Has she said anything? Do you think something's wrong with her parents, maybe?\"\n\n \n\n You seize the chance, shaking your head sadly. \"I don't know, Em. She keeps things to herself lately. Like there's a wall up or something. It's been difficult.\"\n\n \n\n Emily nods sympathetically, a softness replacing her earlier guarded expression. \"I'm sorry. That sounds tough,\" she murmurs gently, reaching out to pat your hand reassuringly. \"If you need someone to talk to, you know I'm here for you.\"\n\n \n\n As she settles back into the sofa, turning her attention to a book on the coffee table, you feel a pang of remorse. You've salvaged the moment and won Emily over, but at the cost of deceiving her further. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You shake your head dismissively. \"Jennifer's just been acting weird lately, holding things back. She's being distant. I don't know what's going on with her.\"\n\n \n\n Emily tilts her head, watching you carefully. \"Is that right?\"\n\n \n\n You nod earnestly. \"Yeah, she's definitely hiding something. It's making things difficult.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's smile suddenly fades, replaced by a cold glare. \"You really think I can't see through that pathetic attempt at a lie?\"\n\n \n\n Caught off guard, you falter. \"Em -\"\n\n \n\n \"Save it,\" Emily snaps sharply. \"I don't know why you're trying to feed me this nonsense, but it's embarrassing.\"\n\n \n\n She rises abruptly, irritation clear in every movement. \"If you’re going to lie to me, at least do it convincingly. I expect better from you.\"\n\n \n\n Without another glance, she leaves the room, disappointment lingering in her wake.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You sit down heavily, reluctantly meeting Emily's suspicious gaze. \"Alright, look. I... might've taken Florence's book.\"\n\n \n\n Emily stares at you, eyes widening. \"You stole her book? Why would you --?\"\n\n \n\n You cut her off gently, raising your hand in a calming gesture. \"The amulet, remember? It needs a precious object to make transformations work.\"\n\n \n\n She recoils slightly, shaking her head in disbelief. \"Florence? Why? What could Florence possibly help you investigate?\"\n\n \n\n \"She knows everyone in Charlton,\" you explain calmly, \"and people trust her. She could open doors I'd never get through otherwise. And I'd use a Forget spell afterward, so there wouldn't be lasting damage.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's jaw tightens, her voice suddenly hard, almost brittle. \"Do you even hear yourself? You've lost control, . What is this doing to you?”\n\n \n\n “It’s for us, Em,” you try. “It’s to help. All of it.”\n\n \n\n She frowns, eying you carefully. “Are you sure about that? Honestly, I don't know what to believe anymore.”\n\n \n\n Emily grabs her jacket roughly, rising without another word and storming from the room, leaving the echo of her accusation hanging heavily between you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You sit down heavily, reluctantly meeting Emily's gaze. \"Alright, look. I... might've taken Florence's book.\"\n\n \n\n Emily pauses, eyeliner pencil still in hand. She tilts her head curiously. \"Interesting. Mind telling me why?\"\n\n \n\n You cross your arms, keeping your voice steady. \"The amulet. You know how it works. I needed something precious to Florence to become her. And Florence knows practically everyone in town. Imagine the doors she can open.\"\n\n \n\n Emily taps the eyeliner thoughtfully against her cheek, a slow smile spreading. \"Florence is well-connected. Clever idea, using her.\"\n\n \n\n She sighs theatrically, though still smiling. \"You could have thought about it a bit more, though. The place is perfect for dates. You've made it slightly uncomfortable for me now.\" She eyes you carefully, then laughs softly. \"But I'll manage.\"\n\n \n\n She leans in conspiratorially, her voice dropping to a whisper. \"Besides, maybe Fresh Pot is a little childish for meeting boys at. Brendan Glove asked me out recently. Maybe I’ll suggest somewhere more private. I think he’s got a car.\"\n\n \n\n You see her eyes sparkle, as her thoughts drift away. “Thanks . Maybe there’s a silver lining to being blacklisted from Fresh Pot after all.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You shake your head slowly, feigning confusion. \"I honestly don't know why Florence would act like that. She's probably just stressed or something.\"\n\n \n\n Emily narrows her eyes slightly. \"She seemed pretty certain I'd done something. Are you sure you didn't say anything?\"\n\n \n\n You offer an apologetic shrug. \"Look, Em. Florence has never struck me as particularly smart. Maybe she's embarrassed about struggling with her book and took it out on you.\"\n\n \n\n Emily hesitates, clearly wavering. \"You think so? She seemed genuinely upset.\"\n\n \n\n You step closer, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"You know I'd never do something to hurt you, Em. Maybe she's having a bad day and took it out on you. I'm sorry you got caught in the crossfire.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's expression softens, and after a moment, she sighs. \"Yeah, maybe you're right. Sorry. I guess I'm a bit on edge. Things around here have been weird lately.\"\n\n \n\n You offer her a gentle smile, though guilt gnaws quietly at your chest. \"We're in this together, okay?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You attempt a casual shrug, forcing a look of mild confusion. \"I have no idea why Florence reacted like that. She's probably embarrassed about struggling with her book. She never struck me as especially bright.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's eyes immediately narrow, cutting through your casual demeanor. \"Really? You think Florence - who practically spends all her working time reading - is annoyed by a book? She might not be smart, , but reading is her passion.\"\n\n \n\n “I don’t know, Em,” you reply, with hesitation. “I don’t know what to say.”\n\n \n\n Emily’s gaze grows icy as she looks at you, piercing. Her lip twitches slightly. \"Or maybe,” she begins. “Maybe you needed something personal for the amulet, didn't you?”\n\n \n\n You freeze, unsure of how to respond. A cold smile spreads on her face. “You took her book, didn’t you?\"\n\n \n\n \"Em,” you falter, unable to quickly recover from her direct accusation. “That's not --\"\n\n \n\n She interrupts sharply. \"Stop. I don't care about Florence, but I care about how your stupidity affects me. Brendan Glove asked me out to Fresh Pot. Now you've made things awkward.\"\n\n \n\n She rises swiftly, eyes narrowing dangerously. \"Maybe I'll suggest we skip coffee altogether. Find someplace private instead. I’m sure Brendan won't mind. He has a car to park up in, after all.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice is sharp with implied threat, eyes flashing with irritation as she pushes past you, leaving a cold chill in her wake. “Just stop screwing around with my life, . I need to make a life here too.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You sigh softly, guilt prickling at your conscience. \"Alright. It was probably me. I might've upset Andrea while… you know, pretending to be you.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's expression darkens slightly, disappointment clear in her eyes. \"Andrea? Really, ? She has enough to deal with at that hotel without us making things harder.\"\n\n \n\n \"I know, Em,\" you reply earnestly. \"I didn't mean to. I was trying to push the investigation forward, get some answers. I didn't think about how it might make Andrea feel.\"\n\n \n\n Emily regards you steadily, clearly conflicted. \"You have to think about these things, . These aren't just pawns; they're people, with feelings. You can't just mess with them for answers.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, genuinely remorseful. \"You're right. I'm really sorry, Em. I'll try to fix things with Andrea, somehow.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s gaze softens at your sincerity, and she sighs softly, picking up her notebook again. \"Thanks for being honest, at least. Just… be more careful from now on, okay?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You hesitate, choosing honesty. \"Alright, Em. It was probably me. I… might've upset Andrea.\"\n\n \n\n Emily rolls her eyes dramatically, setting down her nail file. \"Really, ? I couldn't care less about Andrea's feelings. But you're sabotaging my chances of working there.\"\n\n \n\n \"What?\" you reply, caught off guard.\n\n \n\n She huffs, exasperated. \"You know how few decent jobs there are in Charlton? I was hoping to get some hours at the hotel. My clothes are practically falling apart, and that place actually pays.\"\n\n \n\n She pauses thoughtfully, a mischievous smile playing on her lips. \"Plus, I bet I'd look amazing in one of those French Maid outfits.\"\n\n \n\n You don't quite know how to respond. Emily quickly grows serious, eyes narrowing. \"Stop messing around with my reputation, . If you keep doing things like this, we're going to have problems.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You shake your head gently, feigning ignorance. \"Andrea's just quiet, Em. She's not exactly forthcoming. Maybe the hotel's just getting to her.\"\n\n \n\n Emily frowns slightly, not convinced. \"She might be quiet, but she's sweet. Andrea wouldn't just brush me off for no reason. What did you really do?\"\n\n \n\n You double down softly, though uncertainty seeps into your voice. \"Honestly, Em, I didn't do anything. She's probably having a bad day, that's all.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's expression hardens, her eyes searching yours. \"You know, before all this started, you never would've lied to me. What's happening to you, ?\"\n\n \n\n She stands abruptly, looking away. \"You're not just hurting Andrea, you're hurting me too. Maybe think about that next time you're tempted to mess with someone else's feelings.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You casually shrug, keeping your tone indifferent. \"Andrea's just meek, Em. She's always letting people walk all over her. Probably had a rough day at the hotel.\"\n\n \n\n Emily slowly nods, accepting this. \"That’s true. She's basically Charlton's favourite doormat. Could've been anyone giving her a hard time.\"\n\n \n\n She leans forward slightly, a smirk spreading across her lips. \"Honestly, I don't understand what her issue is. She barely has to lift a finger. Dust a few shelves, fluff a few pillows, and the guests adore her for it.\"\n\n \n\n You glance at Emily, confused. \"What exactly do you mean?\"\n\n \n\n Emily arches an eyebrow knowingly. \"Have you seen the way they dress the maids there? It's hardly for manual labour, is it? They're just making the most of their assets.\" She laughs softly, clearly entertained. \"It's easy money. And probably a bit of fun, if you know how to play it.\"\n\n \n\n She returns to her nails, shaking her head with amusement. \"Andrea needs to lighten up. Charlton is a much easier place when you understand the game.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You offer an apologetic smile. \"Honestly, Em, I think people might react better. Blonde hair might make things easier around here. You know how Charlton can be.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's expression hardens instantly, clearly irritated by your reasoning. \"You think that makes it okay? That you can just change things about me because it's convenient?\"\n\n \n\n She steps back, shaking her head in disbelief. \"This isn't a game, . I’m not some doll you get to dress up however you like because it's easier for you.\"\n\n \n\n “Just believe me, Em,” you tell her. “I had to do this. It’s important. For what we’re doing.”\n\n \n\n Emily raises an eyebrow. She’s not convinced. You take a deep breath and exhale.\n\n \n\n \"I’m sorry,\" you say again, softly. \"I should’ve thought about it more.\"\n\n \n\n Emily sighs heavily, clearly annoyed. \"Whatever. I'll have to dye mine now to match. But next time, ask me first.\" She grabs the shoebox and storms out, leaving a lingering chill behind her.\n\n \n\n You sit down on the sofa, watching TV. About an hour later Emily walks down the stairs, her hair now matching the colour of your own. She sits down next to you in silence, clearly not happy with how she looks.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You offer Emily a confident smile. \"Honestly? People will probably love it. Blonde’s bubbly, carefree. It's exactly what Charlton likes.\"\n\n \n\n Emily hesitates, intrigued. Slowly, she begins to smile, clearly warming to the idea. \"Bubbly and carefree, huh?\" Her eyes sparkle with newfound interest.\n\n \n\n You nod. “Sure. And I had to do this. It’s important. For what we’re doing.”\n\n \n\n Emily nods, but you can see her attention is elsewhere. On your hair. Her brain ticking.\n\n \n\n \"I’m sorry,\" you say again, softly. \"I should’ve thought about it more.\"\n\n \n\n She moves closer to you, barely acknowledging the words, lightly touching her own hair. \"Well, if Charlton wants bubbly… I can be bubbly. It might be nice to surprise people.\"\n\n \n\n “I guess I’m going to have to raid mum’s bathroom supplies,” she says. “No time like the present. Wait here.”\n\n \n\n You wait patiently as Emily leaves the room, a renewed bounce in her step. When she returns some time later, she’s freshly blonde to match you. Clearly pleased with herself, she spins dramatically, striking a playful pose.\n\n \n\n \"Well?\" she asks brightly, slipping effortlessly into a carefree tone. \"Does it look good or what?\"\n\n \n\n You nod, watching as she giggles, admiring herself in the reflection of the window.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You look at Emily reassuringly, your voice gentle. \"It doesn't matter what they think, Em. You're still you, no matter your hair color.\"\n\n \n\n Emily hesitates, frowning uncertainly. \"It’s easy for you to say,” she says quietly. “People here judge the littlest things around here. They’ll see it as a statement. They’ll expect… different things from me.”\n\n \n\n “You don’t need to give in, Em,” you tell her. “It doesn’t matter what people see you like.”\n\n \n\n A sad smile creeps up on Emily’s face. “What if… and what if I don’t recognise myself anymore? That is a big change, .” You watch her gulp. “You look… like someone else.”\n\n \n\n You think you understand the subtext, given what you thought when you saw it for the first time. Stepping closer, you place a hand comfortingly on her shoulder. \"You are still you, Em. Blonde, brunette -- none of that changes the person you are inside.\"\n\n \n\n She considers your words carefully, visibly relaxing. \"Are you sure?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “Absolutely.”\n\n \n\n This is enough to bring a smile back to her face. “Thanks, . It’s just… Charlton makes me nervous sometimes. I guess I better look through mum’s bathroom supplies. See if she's still got some hair dye to match.” she says. “No time like the present. Wait here.”\n\n \n\n Later, when she returns with her freshly dyed blonde hair, you nod warmly. \"See? Looks like you. Still you shining through.\"\n\n \n\n Emily smiles gratefully, uncomfortable in her own skin, but clearly comforted by your sincerity. \"Thanks. I needed to hear that.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You offer Emily a gentle smile. \"Look, Em, you're still the same person underneath. Hair colour won't change that.\"\n\n \n\n Emily frowns immediately, her eyes narrowing. \"Maybe I don't want to be the same person, . Maybe I'm tired of being the boring bookworm.\"\n\n \n\n You blink in surprise, caught off guard by her sudden irritation. \"Em --\"\n\n \n\n \"No,\" she interrupts sharply, frustration clear. \"There I was, thinking you were finally understanding me, but you've missed the whole point. I don't want you to act like the same shy, quiet Emily. I'm not that person anymore.\"\n\n \n\n “Em,” you try. “I didn’t mean -”\n\n \n\n “I don’t think you know what you mean, anymore, ,” she spits. “You keep talking about how you’re doing all this to help me. But do you even know who I am, anymore?”\n\n \n\n You struggle to answer. Emily rolls her eyes and stands up. “Whatever. Let’s see if mum still has a dye kit in her cupboard.”\n\n \n\n She storms off upstairs, returning later with bright blonde locks, her expression proud but defiant. You cautiously comment, \"It looks good, Em.\"\n\n \n\n She stares you down fiercely. \"I know it does.”\n\n \n\n “Are you still upset about your hair, then?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “It was never about the hair, ,” she replies. “Just about you. Start seeing me as I am now, not how you remember me. I'm not going backwards.\"\n\n \n\n She switches on the TV and turns her attention from you to a reality show, leaving you watching her without words.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You sigh, attempting a reassuring smile. \"Look, Em, cheerleaders get special privileges around Charlton. Fewer classes, better grades, less pressure. It’ll make things easier for you.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's eyes narrow immediately. \"You think I care about perks? You think that's a reason to make me look like I've changed who I am?\"\n\n \n\n You try to reach out to her, but she steps back sharply. \"You're supposed to be helping me, not turning me into exactly what I despise.\"\n\n \n\n \"I'm sorry,\" you say quietly, trying to soften her anger. \"I thought --\"\n\n \n\n \"You thought wrong,\" Emily snaps, voice shaking slightly. \"I thought you understood me. Clearly, you don't.\"\n\n \n\n You stare back at your sister, watching her eyes wander over the uniform. “I would never do this,” she mutters, shaking her head.\n\n \n\n There it is. The real issue. You’re not just infiltrating the cheerleaders. You’re rewriting Emily’s life while you do it.\n\n \n\n Emily exhales sharply, rubbing her temples. “Whatever,” she mutters, voice thick with frustration. “It’s not like I can stop you.”\n\n \n\n She returns to the kitchen table and doesn’t look up as she takes another bite of cereal. The conversation is over. But the feeling in your chest lingers.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You offer Emily a confident smile. \"The cheerleaders have it easier, Em. They barely have to study, and their grades stay high. They have influence. We won't need to worry about your lessons nearly as much.\"\n\n \n\n Emily pauses thoughtfully, then begins smiling again, clearly intrigued. \"You know… that's actually pretty smart,\" she muses. \"Less schoolwork means more time for fun things. I won’t have to worry about curses, either.\"\n\n \n\n That stops you for a second. “Wait…” you begin.\n\n \n\n She rises from the kitchen, barely listening to you. She walks around you slowly, inspecting the cheerleader uniform. \"You know, maybe this is exactly what I needed. A bit of school spirit. And honestly? I bet the boys are going to love it.\"\n\n \n\n Emily grins, excitement creeping into her voice. \"I think I could really pull this off. I might even give some of the guys a surprise tomorrow.\" She giggles lightly, clearly embracing her new role.\n\n \n\n \"Thanks, ,\" she says cheerfully, bouncing lightly on her heels. \"This might just be the best idea you've ever had.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You step closer, keeping your voice gentle but firm. \"Em, it's not about perks or popularity. It's about getting closer to the cheerleaders. To Christina. This could be my chance to figure out what's really going on at that school.\"\n\n \n\n Emily studies you cautiously, hesitation flickering in her eyes. \"You honestly think it'll help? Because dressing up like them… it feels like giving up. I would never do this.\"\n\n \n\n There it is. The real issue. You’re not just infiltrating the cheerleaders. You’re rewriting Emily’s life while you do it.\n\n \n\n You place a reassuring hand on her shoulder, feeling her tension ease just a fraction. \"I promise, I'm doing this for us. If you can just hold on a little longer, I swear I'll figure out how to stop the school and the curses.\"\n\n \n\n She searches your face carefully, skepticism still lingering, though softened. \"Is that still your focus, ? Truly?\"\n\n \n\n You nod earnestly. \"Absolutely. It always was. It still is.\"\n\n \n\n Emily finally sighs, resignation settling in her features. \"Fine,\" she says quietly. \"I'll pretend to be a cheerleader until you find out what's really going on. Just… don't lose sight of why we're doing this, okay?\"\n\n \n\n You give her a reassuring smile. \"I won't. I promise.\"\n\n \n\n She nods slowly, finally relaxing. \"Fine. Then I'll pretend to be a cheerleader until you figure it all out.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You try to reason with Emily, explaining carefully, \"Em, this uniform - it gets me close to Christina. It lets me investigate them, find out what they know about the curses.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's eyes flash with irritation. \"Investigate them? Are you serious? I’m finally part of the in-crowd. Do you have any idea what happens to me if they think I'm double-crossing them?\"\n\n \n\n You hesitate, caught off guard by her reaction. \"That’s why we’re doing this. I'm doing this for us, Emily. For you.\"\n\n \n\n Emily scoffs harshly, stepping forward aggressively. \"No, you're not. You're putting my reputation at risk. Christina’s acceptance means security here. Without her, I’m nobody. Without Christina, I’m nothing in this town.\"\n\n \n\n You try again, gently, \"But we need answers. We need to know about the magic. The curses --\"\n\n \n\n Emily cuts you off abruptly, eyes flashing with irritation. \"I don’t care about the curses. I’m now a cheerleader. You’ve sorted out my grades, already.”\n\n \n\n The person sitting at the table is now scowling at you. You try to think of the words to express your concern. “But don’t you want to stop what’s going on? Sort out the school?”\n\n \n\n “Who cares about the school,” she retorts. “Everyone else should look after themselves. I'm looking after me. Fitting in here is what matters. I don't need you jeopardising that.\"\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, clearly disappointed. \"Don't screw this up for me, . Or you'll regret it.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n\n \n \n \"Hey,\" you say. \"About this date.\"\n\n \n\n Emily sighs. \"What about it?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n \n <> \n \n Ask for her help - *You need to be in Emily's form to get help with the date*\n \n \n \n \n \"Hey,\" you say. \"About this date.\"\n\n \n\n Emily sighs. \"What about it?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n “Hey Em,” you say. “I was wondering if you could help me with something.”\n\n \n\n She looks up at you from the sofa. “Sure, what’s on your mind?”\n\n \n\n \n \n “I’ve found a way to stop one of the curses,” you begin. “It’s in the AV Cupboard, but it’s always locked. Dennis has the key. I can borrow it. But he wants a date.”\n\n \n “I need his help getting into the boy's lessons,” you begin. “He said he'll get me a hall pass, but he wants a date.”\n\n \n \n\n “Absolutely not,” Emily says. “I’m not going on a date with him. He’s a pervert.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n Tell her you're going as her - *You need to be in Emily's form to go on a date with Dennis*\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n Emily looks uncomfortable, shifting on the spot as you gently suggest, \"Maybe just wear a bit of make-up. Just enough so Dennis buys it.\"\n\n \n\n She stares at you incredulously, clearly insulted. \"Make-up? You want me to put on make-up so I look good for Dennis?\"\n\n \n\n You hold your hands up defensively. \"It's just to make the whole thing believable, Em. It’s not about you or him. It’s about blending in.\"\n\n \n\n She scoffs sharply, shaking her head in disbelief. \"You're actually serious. You expect me to doll myself up, to impress someone I don’t even want to be seen with?\"\n\n \n\n \"Em, I --\"\n\n \n\n She cuts you off sharply, irritation flashing through her eyes. \"Fine. Whatever gets you his precious help. Just don't pretend you're still doing this for me.\"\n\n \n\n Without waiting for your reply, she storms upstairs to the bathroom. You hear her slamming drawers angrily. After a tense few minutes, Emily returns, subtle make-up carefully applied. But the look in her eyes remains cold and deeply disappointed.\n\n \n\n \"Happy now?\" she asks tersely, her tone clearly indicating the conversation is over.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You carefully suggest, \"Maybe you should wear a little make-up, Em. Just to make the date convincing enough that Dennis helps.\"\n\n \n\n Emily arches an eyebrow, clearly amused rather than offended. \"So, make him think I’m actually into him? Clever.\" A slow smirk forms on her lips. \"I suppose I could play along.\"\n\n \n\n You watch as her irritation fades, replaced by quiet amusement. She seems genuinely intrigued by the idea, even if it's just Dennis.\n\n \n\n \"You really think some mascara and lipstick could help me twist Dennis around my finger?\" she asks thoughtfully. \"Hmm. That actually might be fun.\"\n\n \n\n She stands up decisively, her earlier hesitation entirely replaced by newfound enthusiasm. \"Wait here. I'll be right back.\"\n\n \n\n Emily disappears upstairs. After several minutes, she returns, her face perfectly made up, eyes dramatically framed, lips glossy and full. She twirls playfully, giving you an exaggerated wink.\n\n \n\n \"What do you think?\" she teases, clearly enjoying herself. \"Will Dennis be suitably dazzled?\"\n\n \n\n You nod carefully. She grins, genuinely pleased. \"Thanks for the suggestion, . Always nice to get dolled up.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You offer a cautious smile. \"Maybe you could dress up a bit? Just to make sure Dennis helps.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's face tightens visibly, eyes narrowing with irritation. \"Dress up? Like, wear something nice for Dennis?\"\n\n \n\n You quickly clarify, feeling her tension. \"Just to sell the idea. The quicker you convince him, the quicker it'll be over.\"\n\n \n\n She sighs bitterly, clearly unhappy. \"Fine.\"\n\n \n\n Emily turns sharply and disappears upstairs. You wait awkwardly, the silence uncomfortable. After several minutes, she returns wearing a modest sundress, her arms folded defensively over her chest, eyes wary and deeply uncomfortable.\n\n \n\n \"Well?\" she asks tersely, clearly unhappy. \"Will this do?\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You smile encouragingly. \"Why not dress up a bit? If you have to go, at least make the most of it.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's eyes immediately brighten, clearly delighted by the suggestion. \"Finally, a good idea. At least I can have some fun with this.\"\n\n \n\n She practically skips upstairs, clearly excited by the prospect. After several minutes, she returns confidently, now dressed in a striking mini-skirt, a pair of stylish ankle boots, and a tight crop top that emphasizes her figure. She spins lightly, clearly pleased with herself.\n\n \n\n \"What do you think?\" she asks playfully, clearly enjoying your reaction. \"Think this is enough to get Dennis to eagerly help?\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n Emily flinches visibly, her expression shifting to open disgust. \"Excuse me? You seriously want me to dress up more provocatively? For Dennis?\"\n\n \n\n You try to speak, but she's already shaking her head, stepping back defensively. \"Forget it. I’m not degrading myself further, even to get Dennis on side.\"\n\n \n\n She moves to leave, clearly hurt by your request. \"Let's just get this over with. I don't want to talk about this again.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You give her a reassuring nod, speaking gently. \"You look good, Em. Really. It’s perfect.\"\n\n \n\n She hesitates, seeming genuinely relieved. \"You think so?\"\n\n \n\n \"Definitely,\" you reply honestly. \"Dennis won't know what hit him. Just enough to convince him.\"\n\n \n\n Emily exhales slowly, her posture easing slightly. \"Okay. Let's just get this over with.\" But her eyes soften a bit.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You pause awkwardly, clearing your throat. \"Maybe… tone it down just a little, Em? It's just Dennis. You don't want to give him the wrong idea.\"\n\n \n\n Emily's face immediately shifts into irritation. \"Excuse me? You're the one who told me to dress up in the first place.\"\n\n \n\n She crosses her arms defensively, clearly offended. \"You don't get to suddenly be modest. I look great, and you know it. Make up your mind.\"\n\n \n\n She sighs sharply, shaking her head in disappointment. \"Let's just get this stupid date over with.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You nod appreciatively. \"Honestly, Em, you look amazing. Dennis won’t know what hit him.\"\n\n \n\n Emily beams, clearly delighted by your praise. \"Glad you finally noticed. Maybe you're picking up a thing or two from being me after all.\"\n\n \n\n She steps closer playfully, clearly amused. \"So, am I ready to impress the nerd?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n Emily stares at you blankly, clearly stunned by your request. \"You're joking, right? You seriously want me to dye my hair blonde because Dennis asked for it?\"\n\n \n\n You shift awkwardly, uncomfortable beneath her harsh stare. \"It's just to make sure he's convinced. It'll make things easier for us.\"\n\n \n\n Emily crosses her arms defensively, eyes blazing with anger. \"Make things easier? For who? Him? You're asking me to play out some pervert's fantasy now?\"\n\n \n\n You hesitate, feeling your stomach churn at the accusation. \"It's not like that, Em. It’s just temporary. One evening.\"\n\n \n\n She lets out a bitter, incredulous laugh, shaking her head in disbelief. \"I can't believe you're actually making me do this. For Dennis, of all people.\"\n\n \n\n \"Em, I’m sorry -\"\n\n \n\n \"Save it,\" she snaps, cutting you off sharply. She storms upstairs without another word.\n\n \n\n Nearly an hour later, Emily returns. You gasp at how she looks. Her hair is golden blonde, radiant and glistening. But the difference it makes is deeper. Instead of a mousy bookish girl, the blonde hair makes her look carefree and bubbly. Whereas previously Emily would have looked at home in a library, the girl in front of you looks like she should be cheering alongside a football game.\n\n \n\n \"Well, I hope you’re happy,\" she mutters bitterly. \"We better both get used to it. Hair dye doesn’t just wash out. I now have to look like this every single day. And when you’re me, you do too.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You cautiously suggest, \"Dennis specifically asked for you to be blonde. Maybe you could dye your hair to seal the deal?\"\n\n \n\n Emily's eyes widen instantly, excitement flashing through her expression. \"Blonde? Seriously?\" she asks, a slow grin forming. \"You know, I’ve always wondered what it would be like.\"\n\n \n\n You blink, surprised by her eager response. \"You're... okay with that?\"\n\n \n\n She laughs softly, tossing her hair playfully. \"Are you kidding? Sure, Dennis is a creep, but blonde might actually be fun. Besides, if I'm stuck doing this date, I might as well enjoy it.\"\n\n \n\n Emily practically skips upstairs, excitement replacing any lingering hesitation. You wait quietly, and eventually she returns.\n\n \n\n You gasp at how she looks. Her hair is golden blonde, radiant and glistening. But the difference it makes is deeper. Instead of a mousy bookish girl, the blonde hair makes her look carefree and bubbly. Whereas previously Emily would have looked at home in a library, the girl in front of you looks like she should be cheering alongside a football game. Her smile is bright and playful as she twirls to show it off.\n\n \n\n \"Well?\" she asks teasingly. \"Do blondes really have more fun?\"\n\n \n\n You offer a cautious nod, and she beams confidently. \"Good. Because we're both stuck with this look now. Every time you decide to be me.\"\n\n \n\n She winks mischievously. \"Hope you're ready to handle the attention.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You give Emily a gentle, reassuring smile. \"Em, you'll be fine. Just a quick coffee, get his help, and get out. You're ready for this.\"\n\n \n\n Emily sighs heavily, clearly not convinced but finally nodding with reluctant acceptance. \"Fine. I won't be long.\"\n\n \n\n You watch her gather herself together quietly, slipping out of the house without another word. You spend the evening trying to distract yourself. Watching TV without really absorbing it, tidying up just to keep your hands busy. Yet your mind keeps drifting back to Emily. Guilt gnaws at you, your imagination lingering uncomfortably on what you've asked her to endure.\n\n \n\n Eventually, the sound of the door opening jolts you from your restless pacing. Emily steps back inside, her expression weary, guarded. She meets your eyes briefly, but says nothing.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You offer Emily a confident nod, giving her an encouraging smile. \"You're definitely ready for this, Em. Just think of it as practice. It’ll be easy.\"\n\n \n\n Emily smirks playfully, clearly amused by your encouragement. \"Aw, are you worried about me? Don’t be. I can handle Dennis. Who knows, maybe I'll even have a little fun!\"\n\n \n\n You grimace slightly, causing her to laugh, eyes sparkling with mischief. \"Relax, . I promise I'll behave. Well, mostly.\"\n\n \n\n With a playful wink, she leaves the house, closing the door lightly behind her. You spend the evening distracting yourself - half-watching TV, tidying the living room- but your thoughts keep wandering to Emily, wondering if she's alright, how the date's going. It's oddly difficult to concentrate, your mind uncomfortably restless.\n\n \n\n Eventually, the door clicks open again, and Emily walks in, an amused smile on her lips. Her eyes gleam as she catches sight of your anxious face, clearly enjoying your unease.\n\n \n\n \"You weren't waiting up for me, were you?\" she asks teasingly, clearly entertained by your reaction.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Emily stands in the doorway, clutching the key tightly in her hand. Her cheeks are flushed, and she seems unusually quiet as she approaches you. \"I got your key,\" she murmurs softly, placing it gently into your hand. \"And he'll talk to Harrow.\"\n\n \n Emily stands in the doorway, clutching the key tightly in her hand. Her cheeks are flushed, and she seems unusually quiet as she approaches you. \"I got your key,\" she murmurs softly, placing it gently into your hand.\n\n \n Emily stands in the doorway, cheeks are flushed. She seems unusually quiet as she approaches you. \"I got him to ask Harrow about your hall pass.\"\n\n \n \n\n \"Thanks, Em,\" you say carefully. \"Everything okay?\"\n\n \n\n She hesitates, biting her lip nervously. \"Dennis kissed me. Like, he just... kissed me.\"\n\n \n\n Your eyes widen. \"Dennis kissed you? Are you alright?\"\n\n \n\n Emily exhales slowly, staring thoughtfully into the distance. \"I don’t know. It felt...nice? Like, really awkward, but also kind of sweet.\" Her voice drops. \"Maybe dating isn't as terrible as I thought.\"\n\n \n\n She glances away shyly, clearly affected by the experience. You can feel the shift in her, subtle but undeniable. “Maybe I should lighten up a bit more,” she adds. “Anyway, good night.”\n\n \n\n She bounces up the stairs. Bounces.\n\n \n \n Emily struts into the room, tossing the key carelessly toward you. \"Here’s your precious key,\" she says with a visible shudder. \"And he'll talk to Harrow. Honestly, Dennis is revolting.\"\n\n \n Emily struts into the room, tossing the key carelessly toward you. \"Here’s your precious key,\" she says with a visible shudder. \"Honestly, Dennis is revolting.\"\n\n \n Emily struts into the room, throwing herself down on the sofa. \"He's going to speak to Harrow about that pass,\" she says with a visible shudder. \"Honestly, Dennis is revolting.\"\n\n \n \n\n You raise your eyebrows, noting her disgust. \"Was it that bad?\"\n\n \n\n \"Worse,\" she says with a deep grimace. \"He tried to kiss me, the creep. As if I’d lower myself to that. I practically had to shove him away.\"\n\n \n\n You wince slightly. \"Sorry, Em. You okay?\"\n\n \n\n Emily gives a dismissive wave, irritation still clear on her face. \"I survived. But you're lucky I put up with it at all. Let’s not make this a regular thing. He better not expect a repeat performance. I just hope no one from school saw us.\"\n\n \n\n Without waiting for a reply, she goes the stairs towards her room.\n \n \n \n \n \n Emily approaches you quietly, her expression thoughtful and slightly flushed. She hesitates, then slowly holds out the brass key etched with the Charlton crest. \"I got it,\" she says quietly, avoiding your eyes. \"And he'll talk to Harrow.\"\n\n \n Emily approaches you quietly, her expression thoughtful and slightly flushed. She hesitates, then slowly holds out the brass key etched with the Charlton crest. \"I got it,\" she says quietly, avoiding your eyes.\n\n \n Emily approaches you quietly, her expression thoughtful and slightly flushed. She hesitates, then slowly exhales. \"He'll talk to Harrow,\" she says quietly, avoiding your eyes. \"About the hall pass.\"\n\n \n \n\n You exhale with relief. \"Thanks, Em. Are you alright?\"\n\n \n\n She nods softly, biting her lip. \"You know… it wasn't as terrible as I expected. Dennis was actually...nice. He was sweet, even.\" Her cheeks colour a little more. \"He even asked me out again.\"\n\n \n\n You watch her carefully, noticing the subtle change in her tone. \"And what did you say?\"\n\n \n\n \"I said maybe,\" she admits shyly, her eyes fixed on the floor. \"I mean, it wasn't all bad. Maybe dating isn't so awful after all. Maybe I just need to loosen up.\"\n\n \n\n You feel a pang of worry, realising Emily may have been influenced more than you'd anticipated. She gives you a polite smile, then heads upstairs towards her room.\n\n \n \n Emily strides towards you, her eyes narrowed with barely-contained annoyance, practically thrusting the brass key into your hand. \"He'll talk to Harrow,\" she snaps. \"And here's your key.\"\n\n \n\n \"You did it!\" you say with relief.\n \n \n Emily strides towards you, her eyes narrowed with barely-contained annoyance, practically thrusting the brass key into your hand. \"Here's your key,\" she snaps.\n\n \n\n \"You got it!\" you say with relief.\n\n \n Emily strides towards you, her eyes narrowed with barely-contained annoyance. \"He'll talk to Harrow,\" she snaps.\n\n \n\n \"You did it!\" you say with relief.\n \n \n \n\n She grimaces openly. \"Yeah, along with an earful about how Dennis wants another date. Seriously? As if I'd willingly endure that again.\"\n\n \n\n You give her a sympathetic look. \"So you won't see him again?\"\n\n \n\n Emily scoffs loudly, rolling her eyes dramatically. \"Please. I did my part. Dennis can keep dreaming. I'm not going near him unless it's absolutely necessary.\"\n\n \n\n She tosses her hair dismissively, shaking her head. \"Next time, you do the dirty work. At least he won’t make eyes at you every second.\"\n\n \n\n Emily rolls her eyes, then heads up towards her room.\n \n \n \n \n Emily walks inside slowly, eyes cast downward, avoiding your gaze entirely. She sighs heavily as she sits down.\n\n \n\n \"No luck?\" you ask softly.\n\n \n\n She shakes her head slowly. \"Dennis saw right through it. He knew I wasn't into it. Said he could tell I didn't want to be there. He wouldn't help.\"\n\n \n\n You exhale slowly. \"I'm sorry I put you through that for nothing.\"\n\n \n\n She nods bitterly, staring at her lap. \"Me too. This whole thing was pointless. I know I had ulterior motives, but really, am I that repulsive that he couldn’t enjoy a date with me?”\n\n \n\n “Is that what you’re taking from this?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She shrugs. There is a wounded expression on her face. “I don’t know. I just… maybe I should consider my appearance more.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice is cold, disappointment heavy in her tone. She stands abruptly and heads towards her room, leaving you alone to grapple with her reaction.\n\n \n Emily storms inside, her face tight with annoyance. She tosses her purse onto the sofa angrily, pacing slightly as she glares at you.\n\n \n\n \"No luck?\" you ask nervously.\n\n \n\n \"Of course not,\" she snaps. \"That nerd was smarter than he looks. Kept going on about how I wasn't 'genuine.' Well obviously I wasn't. He's pathetic, and I made sure he knew it.\"\n\n \n\n You wince, sensing her frustration. \"Sorry, Em. I'll find another way.\"\n\n \n\n She scoffs openly, clearly irritated. \"You better. Honestly, , this was humiliating. I don’t appreciate you putting me in these situations.\"\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, still pacing angrily. \"Figure something else out next time, because I'm done playing nice.\"\n\n \n\n Emily storms off to her room. You hear the door slam shut behind her.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"Yeah, if it makes you feel good, go for it,\" you say, keeping your tone casual.\n\n \n\n Emily’s shoulders relax instantly, a bright smile tugging at her lips. “Really? I thought so too,” she says, smoothing her clothes down one last time before turning to you fully. “I mean, it’s just a little effort, right? Nothing weird.” She grins and gives a small twirl, as if testing how the outfit moves. “Maybe I should pick up a few new things too… just a little update.”\n\n \n\n \n She steps closer, nudging you playfully. “Guess you do have good taste,” she teases. “Maybe I’ll start asking you before I pick things out.” There’s an ease between you, the warmth of sibling trust still present, even as Charlton’s influence begins to take hold.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n She pauses for a moment, running her fingers along the hem of her top. “I mean, it’s not like I needed your opinion or anything,” she adds, her tone casual, but with an edge of independence. “But… thanks.” There’s no hostility, just a quiet assertion that she made this choice for herself, not for anyone else. She turns back to the mirror, giving her reflection one last look before moving on.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"You never used to care about that stuff,\" you say, watching her reaction.\n\n \n\n Emily’s expression shifts, just for a moment. Her fingers pause where they were adjusting her hem, a flicker of something uncertain crossing her face. “Well, maybe I should have,” she says after a beat, the words coming slower, like she’s testing them out herself. “People notice these things, you know?\"\n\n \n\n \n She glances at you again, searching for something in your expression. “I mean… you don’t think it’s weird, do you?” she asks, a little quieter now. There’s still hesitation in her voice, the need for reassurance. Even with Charlton’s influence creeping in, she still values what you think.\n\n \n\n Her fingers drift back to her hair, smoothing out an invisible flaw. “I dunno, maybe I’m just overthinking it.” She gives a small laugh, but it doesn’t quite reach her eyes. “I just… thought it’d be nice to care about how I look, for once.” She doesn’t sound fully convinced, but there’s a quiet vulnerability in the way she says it, like she’s waiting for you to tell her it’s okay.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Her lips press together for a second before she exhales, shaking her head. “It’s just clothes,” she mutters, brushing a stray hair behind her ear. “I can try new things if I want.” She doesn’t sound angry, just firm. Like she’s already decided this is something she’s going to do, whether you approve or not.\n\n \n\n She lingers by the mirror, adjusting her sleeve before turning away. “You don’t have to like it,” she adds, not looking at you. “It’s not about that.” There’s no heat in her voice, just a quiet certainty. Then, with a final glance at her reflection, she moves on, leaving the conversation behind her.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"You’re right, why not go out?\" you say, keeping your tone relaxed.\n\n \n\n Emily’s face immediately brightens. “Exactly!” she says, swinging her legs off the couch and standing up. “I mean, what else am I supposed to do? Sit around all day and stare at the walls?” She gives herself a quick glance in the nearest reflective surface, adjusting the way her clothes fall on her frame, like she’s already thinking about how she’ll present herself to the world outside.\n\n \n\n \n She grins and nudges your shoulder playfully. “See, this is why you’re not totally hopeless,” she teases. “Maybe I’ll bring you back something while I’m out.” It’s a small comment, but there’s an easy warmth behind it - like she genuinely enjoys having you on her side.\n\n \n\n As she moves toward the door, she pauses for just a second, running her fingers through her hair one last time. “You know, I should do this more often,” she muses, mostly to herself. The thought lingers, but she doesn’t wait for an answer before heading out.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n She smirks, flipping her hair back over one shoulder. “Knew you wouldn’t care.” There’s no real bite to it, just a casual dismissal, like she expected you to agree all along.\n\n \n\n She takes a moment to straighten out her top, smoothing down the fabric before heading for the door. “Whatever. Later,” she calls over her shoulder, not even waiting for a response. It’s clear she’s already moved on to thinking about what’s next.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"People are going to notice,\" you say, watching her reaction.\n\n \n\n Emily’s enthusiasm falters for just a moment. “Why would they?” she asks, leaning back slightly. The question isn’t defensive, but there’s a challenge in it, like she wants you to prove there’s a reason she shouldn’t.\n\n \n\n \n She studies you, waiting for a real answer. You sigh.\n\n \n\n “Look, if I go to school as you, people might see you in town. Best case, they’ll think it’s weird for a student to be out during the day. Worst case, they’ll bring you back to school. And how will we explain that?\"\n\n \n\n She exhales through her nose, sitting back down with a slight huff. “Ugh, fine, I’ll stay in.” There’s no real frustration in her voice, just mild disappointment, but she lets it go easily enough.\n\n \n\n Still, she lingers, absentmindedly adjusting the way her clothes sit before settling back down. “I just don’t get why it’s a big deal,” she mutters, more to herself than to you. “I mean, what’s the point of being here if I can’t actually do anything?” The restlessness hasn’t left her - just been pushed aside for now.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n She rolls her eyes, slumping back onto the couch. “Oh, please,” she scoffs. “Who even cares?” But the way she shifts in place suggests she knows the answer.\n\n \n\n You sigh. “Look, if I go to school as you, people might see you in town. Best case, they’ll think it’s weird for a student to be out during the day. Worst case, they’ll bring you back to school. And how will we explain that?\"\n\n \n\n For a moment, she drums her fingers against the armrest, staring off toward the window like she’s still debating it. Then, with a heavy sigh, she flops back. “Fine, whatever.” Her tone is dismissive, but the spark of excitement from earlier is gone.\n\n \n\n She adjusts her clothes with a little more care than necessary, smoothing out wrinkles that aren’t there. “Guess I’ll just sit here and stare at the walls some more,” she mutters under her breath. It’s clear she’s not happy about it, but for now, she’s staying put.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"You’re probably right,\" you admit, watching the way she relaxes at your words.\n\n \n\n Emily’s smile brightens, and she lets out a small laugh. “See? That’s what I’m saying.” She pushes away from the couch, running a hand through her hair with a quiet hum. “It’s just fun. What’s the point of acting all awkward about it? Guys like a little confidence.”\n\n \n\n \n She steps closer, linking her arm with yours for a brief, casual squeeze. “You do get it,” she says, grinning. “You should get it. Like, when was the last time you went on a real date?” She tilts her head, eyes playful. “Maybe I should set you up with someone… if Jennifer’s too busy.”\n\n \n\n She lingers by the mirror, adjusting a strand of hair. “I mean, I used to overthink it too,” she muses. “But it’s so much easier just to go with the flow. It’s not like I’m getting married or anything.” She laughs, but there’s a certainty in her voice - it’s clear she’s fully embracing this new mindset.\n\n \n \n Emily turns away, returning to staring in the mirror. There is a hint of your sister there, but you realise that it's now been replaced. A large part of the person in front of you... belongs in Charlton.\n\n \n\n \n You need to speak to Gladys. Fast.\n\n You need to find help. Fast.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n She tilts her head at you, as if studying your face. “Huh,” she says after a beat, smirking faintly. “Didn’t think you’d actually agree.” There’s something almost amused in her tone, like she’s reassessing you.\n\n \n\n “Though, seriously,” she adds, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “You might want to take notes. Charlton boys love a girl who knows how to flirt.” She winks, and for a moment, you can’t tell if she’s joking.\n\n \n\n She turns back toward the window, adjusting her clothes with a satisfied little tug. “Anyway, I’m so done stressing over this stuff.” Her posture is looser now, more assured. She isn’t just saying it - she truly believes it.\n\n \n \n Emily turns away, returning to staring in the window. There is a hint of your sister there, but you realise that it's now been replaced. A large part of the person in front of you... belongs in Charlton.\n\n \n\n \n You need to speak to Gladys. Fast.\n\n You need to find help. Fast.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"That doesn’t sound like you,\" you say carefully.\n\n \n\n Emily lets out a short, breathy laugh, shaking her head. “Oh, come on,” she groans, rolling her eyes. “It’s flirting. I’m not exactly running off to elope.”\n\n \n\n \n She hesitates, glancing at you. “You really think it’s weird?” she asks, her voice quieter now. The confidence from earlier falters just slightly, and for a brief moment, she seems uncertain - like she’s waiting for you to tell her it’s okay to still question things.\n\n \n\n She exhales, brushing her fingers over the seam of her sleeve. “I don’t know,” she admits, a little softer now. “I do like the attention… but I guess I never cared much about that before.” Her lips press together, like she’s trying to figure out whether that even bothers her.\n\n \n \n Emily turns away, turning to stare in the mirror. There is a hint of your sister there, but you realise that it's now been replaced. A large part of the person in front of you... belongs in Charlton.\n\n \n\n \n You need to speak to Gladys. Fast.\n\n You need to find help. Fast.\n \n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Her expression hardens just a little. “Seriously? You’re acting like I’m doing something wrong,” she says, crossing her arms. “I was just talking. It’s fun. It’s not my fault you don’t know how to play along.”\n\n \n\n She turns away, running her fingers absently through her hair before shaking her head. “Whatever. If you want to be weird about it, go ahead,” she mutters, her tone dismissive but just a little forced. “I’m fine.”\n\n \n \n Emily turns away, turning to stare in the mirror. There is a hint of your sister there, but you realise that it's now been replaced. A large part of the person in front of you... belongs in Charlton.\n\n \n\n \n You need to speak to Gladys. Fast.\n\n You need to find help. Fast.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"I guess there’s nothing to worry about,\" you say, forcing the words out.\n\n \n\n Emily beams, crossing her legs as she leans forward. “See? You get it,” she purrs. “I mean, it’s just so obvious once you stop fighting it. I can do whatever I want here.”\n\n \n\n \n She nudges you playfully, grinning. “Honestly, you should be thanking me. I used to be such a mess. Can you imagine if I’d kept wasting my time worrying about dumb stuff like college?” She gives a dramatic shudder. “Ugh. I’d rather die.”\n\n \n\n She flips open the magazine again, scanning the pages with practiced ease. “But now?” She hums in satisfaction. “I have options.” Her fingers trail over an article about dressing to impress. “Charlton gives you exactly what you deserve.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at your sister. Finally admitting the truth to yourself. Emily isn’t just changing. She’s gone.\n\n \n\n And if Charlton has already taken her, then you need to figure out if there’s any way to stop it before it takes you, too.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n She lets out a small, knowing laugh. “I knew you’d come around eventually,” she says, flipping her hair back. “I mean, really, what choice did you have? You live here. Might as well enjoy it.”\n\n \n\n She goes back to the magazine, flicking through the pages with a pleased little hum. “Now, what should I wear for my first shift?” She grins, half to herself. “I mean, I could start at the salon, but the bar… that could be interesting.”\n\n \n\n Her voice is light, teasing, but there’s something in the way she says it that makes your stomach turn.\n\n \n\n You stare back at your sister. Finally admitting the truth to yourself. Emily isn’t just changing. She’s gone.\n\n \n\n And if Charlton has already taken her, then you need to figure out if there’s any way to stop it before it takes you, too.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"You don’t even sound like yourself anymore,\" you say, unable to hide the unease in your voice.\n\n \n\n Emily sighs, like she’s dealing with a particularly slow student. “Ugh, again with this?” She places a hand on her hip, looking at you with amused pity. “You really don’t get it, do you?”\n\n \n\n \n She shifts slightly, considering you for a moment. “I am myself,” she insists, her brown eyes steady. “Just… better. I’m happier, I’m confident, and everything just works now. Why is that such a bad thing?”\n\n \n\n She watches your face, waiting for you to argue, but when you don’t immediately respond, she sighs, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “You’ll understand eventually,” she says, her tone softer now. “You have to. Charlton gives you things if you just let it.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at your sister. Finally admitting the truth to yourself. Emily isn’t just changing. She’s gone.\n\n \n\n And if Charlton has already taken her, then you need to figure out if there’s any way to stop it before it takes you, too.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Her expression cools, the warmth draining slightly. “God, you sound like a jealous loser.” She rolls her eyes, flipping open the magazine again. “I’m fine. Better than fine.”\n\n \n\n She turns a page with exaggerated patience, not even looking at you anymore. “You’re the one who’s miserable,” she murmurs. “And honestly? That sounds like a you problem.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at your sister. Finally admitting the truth to yourself. Emily isn’t just changing. She’s gone.\n\n \n\n And if Charlton has already taken her, then you need to figure out if there’s any way to stop it before it takes you, too.\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You don’t answer right away. There’s something off about this. About the way she’s acting, the ease in her voice.\n\n \n\n \"Emily, where did you get this?\"\n\n \n\n She hesitates, then sighs. \"There’s a place. One of the girls at school told me about it.\" She leans back against the sofa, tapping a nail against the side of the snuffbox.\n\n \n\n “What place?”\n\n \n\n Emily sighs. \"It’s a bar. The Red Room. It’s out of town. Not far, but… far enough.\" She shrugs, like it’s not a big deal. \"I went to check it out.\"\n\n \n\n Your stomach tightens. \"You left Charlton? Who gave you this?\"\n\n \n \n “A guy,” she replies, hesitantly. “Called Old Scrumpy Jack.”\n\n \n\n “Old Scrumpy Jack?” you stammer in disbelief. “What sort of name is that, Em?”\n\n \n\n Emily’s eyes flick to yours, something unreadable behind them. Then she laughs softly, shaking her head. \"You’re acting like I wandered into some dangerous back alley.\" She gestures vaguely at the box. \"This is safe. It’s meant to help. You take it, and it reduces the impact the school has on you. That feeling like you’re constantly being nudged into something? That haze? It cuts through it.\"\n\n \n\n She offers it out to you, her expression expectant. \"Do you want to try it?\"\n\n \n\n “Try what?”\n\n \n\n “The man - Scrumpy Jack - gave me specific instructions. You take a sniff, then I do. And you’ll find that we share the burden you’re carrying. I’ve been thinking - you shouldn’t have to do all of this whilst I sit at home, waiting? I did this for you.”\n\n \n\n You give Emily a hard look. She is smiling, almost pleading with her expression. Whatever she is holding, it’s coming from a good place. But you sense the energies of magic emanating from the snuffbox. Potent and raw.\n\n \n\n “This is magical, Em,” you tell her. “I don’t know if we want to mess with it.”\n\n \n\n “You mess with magic everyday,” she replies. “What’s the harm in trying it? I want to help.”\n\n \n\n You look at her again. She seems eager. Almost hanging on this to contribute to your investigation somehow.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n You hesitate, your gaze flicking between Emily and the box. The scent of the powder - something faintly floral, almost sweet - lingers in the air, just enough to be noticeable.\n\n \n\n \"You’re sure this works?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n Emily’s fingers tighten slightly around the snuffbox as she lifts it closer. \"I wouldn’t offer if I wasn’t.\"\n\n \n\n There’s something expectant in her expression. Not just excitement, but relief, like she’s been waiting for you to trust her with this.\n\n \n\n \"We take it together,\" she says. Her brown eyes hold yours, searching. \"You shouldn’t have to do this alone.\"\n\n \n\n She tilts the box slightly, the red powder shifting like fine sand within the container. \"So?\" she asks, voice softer now. \"Are we doing this?\"\n\n \n\n You only hold out for a moment longer, then nod. She grins. “Alright. I go first.”\n\n \n\n You watch with nervousness as Emily turns the snuffbox to face her. She gives you one last look before leaning over it, and holding one nostril closed with her spare hand, takes a snort from the box hanging between you. \n\n \n\n For a moment, you can almost see the faint traces of yellow energy shoot up into her body, before fading away as the powder enters her bloodstream. She looks up at you, a new smile forming on her face. Her pupils have dilated slightly.\n\n \n\n “Now… you”, she says, holding out the box.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You hesitate for only a moment longer before reaching for the box.\n\n \n\n Emily’s grin widens slightly, her pupils still blown from the effects of the powder she just inhaled. She watches intently as you lean forward, mirroring her earlier movement.\n\n \n\n Waiting for just a moment longer, you hold one nostril shut and inhale.\n\n \n\n \n The powder hits instantly. Warmth spreads from the back of your throat, tingling down your limbs like static beneath your skin.\n\n \n\n Then - a pull.\n\n \n\n You gasp as something seeps out of you, a golden glow escaping from your skin like smoke being siphoned away.\n\n \n\n The energy moves slowly at first, curling into the air before drifting toward Emily. Then, suddenly, it lurches, a rush of golden light flowing out of your chest and straight into hers.\n\n \n\n Emily inhales sharply, her body stiffening for just a second before she exhales in a soft, breathy giggle.\n\n \n\n Your stomach clenches. Emily never giggles like that.\n\n \n\n She shifts on the sofa, fingers absentmindedly playing with a loose strand of her hair, twisting it between her fingers. There’s something strangely assured about her now - not more confident, exactly, but more… at ease. Relaxed. Less concerned.\n\n \n\n \"Did it work?\" she asks, tilting her head. Her voice sounds the same, but there’s a lilt to it now, a slight singsong quality that wasn’t there before.\n\n \n\n You barely hear her. Something is wrong. In yourself. You feel lighter. But not in a good way.\n\n \n\n There’s a strange absence inside you, a hollowness you can’t quite define. Your heartbeat feels a little too slow, your breath just a little too shallow. Your posture is different. Shoulders less square, your movements softer, more fluid. Then, instinctively, you adjust your sleeves. Deliberate, careful, delicate.\n\n \n \n You freeze.\n\n \n\n You’ve never moved like that before.\n\n \n\n Your fingers twitch slightly, the remnants of that subconscious action still lingering. And the way you’re sitting - it’s... different.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n The powder hits instantly, a rush of warmth flooding your chest, coiling through your limbs.\n\n \n\n Then - movement. You see it. Magic, visible, living.\n\n \n\n At first, it moves out of you, just as it had with Emily. But then it stops, swirling in the air, hanging between the two of you like a cloud of smoke.\n\n \n\n It lingers for only a second before it rushes forward, splitting in two. Half surging into Emily, half surging straight back into you.\n\n \n\n You inhale sharply as heat blossoms under your skin, something twisting deep inside. Your heartbeat pounds, quickened, too fast, too strong.\n\n \n\n Emily lets out a soft breath, her smile curling at the edges.\n\n \n\n \"That’s it,\" she murmurs, watching you with something almost delighted.\n\n \n\n You shudder as the warmth settles, spreading through your body like it’s always belonged there. Something feels different, off, but not wrong.\n\n \n\n Emily stretches, rolling her shoulders as if easing into her own transformation. There’s a new confidence in the way she moves now, a quiet satisfaction.\n\n \n\n \"This will help you,\" she says simply, like it’s obvious.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \"Emily,” you stammer. “What did we just do?\"\n\n \n\n She blinks at you, frowning slightly, but it doesn’t last. She just shakes her head, smiling in a way that’s almost dismissive.\n\n \n\n \"I told you. It helps, doesn’t it?\"\n\n \n\n She gestures toward you vaguely, her expression open, airy, completely untroubled. Like nothing about this feels strange to her at all.\n\n \n\n \"It worked, right? You feel better?\"\n\n \n\n You open your mouth - to argue, to demand an explanation, to undo whatever just happened - but stop.\n\n \n\n Because no one forced you.\n\n \n\n Emily may have offered it, but you were the one who took it. The consequences are yours to own.\n\n \n\n Emily giggles, putting the powder away. She seems breezy. Carefree. You might feel more grounded, but the magic has had an impact on Emily too.\n\n \n\n And that's on you.\n\n \n You swallow. \"Help me what?\"\n\n \n\n Emily raises a brow, amused. \"Integrate. You want to belong in Charlton, don’t you?\"\n\n \n\n She gestures toward you, and you feel it - the lingering sensation in your skin, in your very being, shifting ever so slightly toward something more... aligned.\n\n \n\n \"This is me helping, . You can fit in. Be the best you.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice is calm, certain. And as you sit there, pulse still racing, you realize she genuinely believes it.\n\n \n\n You begin to object, you feel the anger rising. But Emily’s smile disarms you before you can speak. You realise that whilst Emily may have offered it, you were the one who took it.\n\n \n\n The consequences are on you.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You don’t reach for the box. \"We don’t need it, Emily.\"\n\n \n\n Her smile falters, just slightly. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n You exhale, choosing your words carefully. \"I know you’re trying to help. And I appreciate it. Really, I do. But we don’t need this. We don’t need to use more magic than we’re already using.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s fingers tighten around the snuffbox, her expression flickering between confusion and frustration.\n\n \n\n \"But this could make things easier,\" she insists, sitting forward slightly. \"You don’t have to do everything alone. I could take some of the weight off of you.\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"I don’t want you to have to deal with this, Em.\"\n\n \n\n Emily blinks at you, something unreadable in her expression. \"But… I want to.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice is quieter now, less certain than before. The confidence she had when she first presented the snuffbox is slipping away, replaced by something more vulnerable.\n\n \n\n \"You’re always the one carrying everything,\" she murmurs. \"You’re the one dealing with Charlton, with the magic, with the weirdness. And I just --\" She exhales sharply, pressing her lips together. \"I just wanted to help.\"\n\n \n\n You sit down beside her. \"You do help,\" you say gently.\n\n \n\n She lets out a short breath, shaking her head. \"Not really.\"\n\n \n\n \"Yeah, really.\" You glance at her, meeting her gaze. \"You being here? Having someone who knows what is going on. What is really going on? That helps more than you know.\"\n\n \n\n Emily doesn’t answer right away. She looks down at the snuffbox, running a thumb along the edge of it.\n\n \n\n \"I just hate seeing you deal with all of this on your own,\" she admits after a pause.\n\n \n\n \"Then don’t,\" you say. \"We’ll deal with it together.\"\n\n \n\n Emily looks at you again, studying your face, then exhales. \"Together, huh?\"\n\n \n\n \"Yeah.\"\n\n \n\n Her lips press together, but then, slowly, she nods. She doesn’t push the snuffbox toward you again. Instead, she closes it, setting it down on the table.\n\n \n\n \"Okay.\"\n\n \n\n Her disappointment lingers, but something else has settled between you now. She gives you a smile, one full of emotion. And sibling love.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You look at what Emily is holding out towards you. The first thing you notice is how pristine the cover is. Sleek, glossy, like a textbook that belongs in an upscale school. This definitely didn’t come from Charlton.\n\n \n\n “What’s that?”\n\n \n\n \"It’s something I got from my last school,” she replies. “Back in the city. Back home.\"\n\n \n\n You frown, trying to understand. She sees your expression and offers a smile. \"I’m sure things have changed since you were at school. Curricula change over time. If you’re struggling, maybe it can help? Even in Charlton, they have to base their lessons on something.\"\n\n \n\n She sighs before continuing. \"I can’t understand a lot of it. It was beyond me, even back then. But you might be able to. There’s things that have changed since you sat in lessons. Just give it a read. Maybe something in there can help you keep my grades up.”\n\n \n\n There’s something hesitant in her tone, like she’s not used to admitting when she needs help.\n\n \n\n But she’s offering it to you. Not just the book, but a way for you to help her, too.\n\n \n The magazine shines under the dim lighting, its glossy cover crisp from careful handling. The title, A New Woman, stands out in bold, elegant font. The lead cover story is “*15 Fashion Tips For The New Season*.”\n\n \n\n Emily grins slightly as she offers it to you. \"This is important.\"\n\n \n\n You blink at her. \"A magazine?\"\n\n \n\n She nods. \"Not just any magazine. It’s A New Woman. It’s like the bible for Charlton girls. This one talks about style. If you’re going to fit in as me, you need to work on your fashion sense.\"\n\n \n\n You glance down at it. Despite having a style that would look dated beyond the 1960s, the cover girl is effortlessly styled, smiling with polished confidence. \n\n \n\n \"Where did you get this?\"\n\n \n\n \"From Pete’s Pharmacy,” Emily replies. “They always have them in stock.\"\n\n \n\n That makes you pause. You flip the magazine over, eyes scanning the fine print near the barcode. Publisher: Sally Hope Publishing, Charlton.\n\n \n\n *Charlton.*\n\n \n\n You stare at the magazine again. Almost surprising to you, there’s no hint of magic woven into the magazine, no sense of mystical curses. As far as you can tell.\n\n \n\n You look up at Emily, but she’s watching you expectantly, like she genuinely thinks this is something you should appreciate. \"It’s a nice thing to give you, isn’t it?\" she says brightly.\n\n \n\n You glance once again at the magazine. Somehow, her words do not make you feel any better.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n\n \n You exhale and sit down, taking the book from Emily and flick open the pages.\n\n \n\n The words on the page feel dense at first - complex theories, advanced formulas, essays that feel just out of reach. But as you settle in, it starts to make sense.\n\n \n\n Time passes, the room quiet aside from the occasional sound of Emily shifting beside you.\n\n \n\n The more you read, the more you realize that you weren’t taught any of this at school.\n\n \n\n And yet, even in Charlton, the teachers would have to acknowledge this knowledge. If Emily can apply it properly, it might help her keep ahead in class.\n\n \n\n “Looks like you’ve found something of value?” Emily says, bringing you out of your focus. \n\n \n\n You look up - realising Emily is now standing. “Sorry. I got into it.”\n\n \n\n She smiles at you. “Don’t let me stop you. I’m just going to bed.”\n\n \n\n You nod. “I might just finish this chapter.”\n\n \n\n She giggles. “Still the book worm. Enjoy - good night!” \n\n \n\n You smile as Emily goes up to her room. Then you turn back to the book and continue to read for a bit, almost smiling as you realise how much you thought you knew has been revised. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You exhale and sit down, taking the magazine from Emily and flick open the pages.\n\n \n\n The pages are filled with sleek layouts, style guides, beauty tips, and social etiquette rules. You skip through to the main cover story and begin reading the main article.\n\n \n\n It seems pointless and trivial. As you read the introduction, you wonder how long you’ll have to keep this up, in order not to offend Emily.\n\n \n\n But quickly, you find yourself drawn into it. You find yourself lingering on certain sections. How to dress to impress, how to present confidence, how to read social cues. \n\n \n\n The sense of superficiality never passes, but you can’t deny that you’re learning. As time drifts by, you note at least a few things that you would otherwise have not considered. \n\n \n\n You sense Emily looking at you from beside you, clearly pleased. \"See?\" she says, tilting her head. \"It’s good, isn’t it?\"\n\n \n\n You offer her a polite smile. She giggles. “I’m going to go up to my room, but feel free to finish it. Just leave it on the side when you’re done.”\n\n \n\n You casually nod and watch Emily ascend the stairs. In spite of your initial impressions, you return to the article, finding yourself spending a bit more time considering your appearance before finally putting it aside.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n You shake your head. \"You should keep this, Emily.\"\n\n \n\n Emily falters. \"But it could help you.\"\n\n \n\n You exhale, offering her a small smile. \"I’ll get by. You need it more than I do. I appreciate the offer, but even if you get one thing from it, it’s better for you to learn than me.\"\n\n \n\n You see her wincing. “But I don’t get it.”\n\n \n\n Smiling, you open the book up on the coffee table. “Look, it’s not so hard. Let me show you.”\n\n \n\n You spend some time talking Emily through some of the more basic concepts. Surprisingly, you find Emily was right. There’s things in this textbook that you weren’t taught. But together, you and Emily work through the textbook, solving questions together. \n\n \n\n You notice she is still struggling with the material - her fingers hovering over the words, her eyes flicking over the same paragraph multiple times. But at least by the time she tells you she’s going to bed, she’s at least learned a thing or two.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Emily pouts slightly when you push the magazine back toward her.\n\n \n\n \"You don’t want it?\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"I can get by. There’s other ways to solving our problems than me knowing how to dress to impress.”\n\n \n\n “Besides,” you add, seeing the disappointment on her face. “You should keep it. It seems important to you\"\n\n \n\n She hums, but doesn’t argue. She looks back at the magazine, then nods. “Okay,” she says.\n\n \n\n She flips it open again, settling deeper into the sofa. You glance at her as she starts reading. She looks... engrossed. Something about the way she studies the pages, the way her fingers trace the layout, feels different.\n\n \n\n You don’t remember her ever being like this. Until recently, it would have been a book. Now, the contents of the magazine seems like it’s the centre of her world.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n **Your home**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home.png]\n\n \nYour family home has an open-plan kitchen within the living room. A large table separates the kitchen space from the lounge area, which boasts a big sofa and a giant TV at the other end.\n\n \n\n \n You make your way down the stairs, heart pounding a little harder than you’d like to admit.\n\n \n\n Emily sits at the kitchen table with a cup of tea. When she sees you, she doesn’t look surprised. She exhales softly, setting her cup down.\n\n \n\n \"I took the amulet,\" she says simply.\n\n \n\n You cross your arms. \"Yeah, I figured that out.\"\n\n \n\n She meets your gaze, something unshakable in her expression.\n\n \n\n \"You’re not helping, . You’re just… pretending.\" She shakes her head, pressing her lips together. \"You need to start taking this seriously. Because I can’t do this anymore. I can’t face another day there. So you’re going to go to school today. As me. Whether you like it or not.\"\n\n \n\n There’s exhaustion in her voice, something raw and weary. She’s not trying to be cruel. She’s just desperate.\n\n \n\n She folds her arms. \"I’m not giving it back. Not until you promise me that you’ll go.\"\n\n \n You make your way down the stairs, heart pounding a little harder than you’d like to admit.\n\n \n\n Emily looks up at you, a smug, satisfied expression on her face. She doesn’t even bother hiding the amulet. It’s sitting beside her, resting casually on the armrest like it belongs there.\n\n \n\n \"I took the amulet,\" she says, almost cheerful.\n\n \n\n You narrow your eyes. \"Yeah. I can see that.\"\n\n \n\n She leans back, stretching lazily. \"I don’t think I need your help anymore.\"\n\n \n\n Her casual dismissal sends a cold prickle down your spine. You raise an eyebrow at her, tension hanging in the air.\n\n \n\n \"School isn’t so bad,” she says, nonchalantly. “Actually… I kind of like it.\"\n\n \n\n You stare at her, mouth dropping open. \"But you hate school. That school, I mean.\"\n\n \n\n Emily grins, shrugging. \"Not anymore.\"\n\n \n\n Her fingers tap lightly against the amulet. \"And I don’t see why you should go in my place. Why should you get to experience the best days of my life when I can just… enjoy them myself?\"\n\n \n\n She looks at you expectantly, waiting for you to argue.\n\n \n\n \"So,\" she says, voice light, sweet even. \"I think I’m just going to hold on to this.\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You let out a slow breath. \"Fine.\"\n\n \n\n Emily blinks, caught off guard. \"You mean it?\"\n\n \n\n \"Yeah,\" you sigh. \"If it’s hurting you so much, I’ll go to school today.\"\n\n \n\n Her shoulders loosen slightly, relief flickering across her face. “And you’ll take it seriously? You won’t cause me anymore trouble?”\n\n \n\n Your eyes linger on the amulet. Then you nod. “I promise.”\n\n \n\n Emily eyes you carefully, judging you for a long moment. Eventually, she takes a breath, picks up the amulet and slides it over the kitchen table.\n\n \n\n \"Good,\" she murmurs. “I didn’t want to do this, . But I mean it. You’re not helping.”\n\n \n\n You can only wait a moment before reaching over and snatching up the amulet. A little too eagerly. You look back at Emily, seeing her eyes narrowing. “I’ll try.”\n\n \n\n Emily stands, brushing past you. \"I guess I’m housebound today. Don’t be late for school.\"\n\n \n\n Your sister walks up the stairs, leaving you alone.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You watch her for a long moment, then exhale. \"Fine. Go then.\"\n\n \n\n Emily smiles brightly, delighted. \"Knew you’d come around,\" she says, tossing the amulet back toward you like an afterthought. \n\n \n\n You barely catch it before it hits the floor.\n\n \n\n She stands, stretching. She looks excited, almost giddy. \"Alright, well. Have fun at work, .\"\n\n \n\n She practically skips away, humming to herself.\n\n \n\n You glance down at the amulet. The weight of it in your palm feels heavier than it should.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You shake your head. \"No. Give it back.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s expression hardens. \"You’re not listening.\"\n\n \n\n \"No, I am,\" you say. \"I get why you did this, but I need the amulet. You can’t just take it from me.\"\n\n \n\n Her fingers tighten into fists. She looks away, breathing hard. \"You don’t get it. You don’t know what it’s like to be in that place every day.\"\n\n \n\n You don’t argue. You just hold out your hand.\n\n \n\n For a moment, it looks like she’s going to refuse. Then, with a frustrated noise, she shoves it toward you.\n\n \n\n \"Fine.\"\n\n \n\n She storms off out of the door before you can say anything else, bound for the school she desperately hates.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You look her dead in the eyes, barely keeping your anger under control. \"Give it back, Emily.\"\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, mock innocence in her eyes. \"Make me.\"\n\n \n\n You take a step forward. Her expression shifts. For the first time, she actually looks irritated.\n\n \n\n “That school is messing with you,” you warn her. “So much that you don’t see it anymore.”\n\n \n\n “Maybe it is,” she spits back. “Or maybe I’m just growing up. And you just can’t accept it.”\n\n \n\n “You don’t sound like a mature adult to me right now,” you reply.\n\n \n\n She glares at you, anger clearly spread across her face. \"God, fine.\" She rolls her eyes and throws the amulet at you.\n\n \n\n You barely catch it before it hits your chest. \"Go to school, then. Go pretend to be me, if it makes you feel better. If you ask me, I think you’re enjoying it a bit too much.\"\n\n \n\n She flips open her magazine and goes right back to reading, but her eyes constantly look up at you. “Waiting for something?” she taunts you.\n\n \n\n You hold the amulet firmly in your hands. In spite of her words, you feel you can’t back out now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You step closer, eyes locked on the trinket. \"Emily, what are you doing?\"\n\n \n\n She doesn’t flinch. She doesn’t hesitate. Instead, she glares at you. \"I’m done being the only one who can’t use magic.\"\n\n \n\n Her words hit like a slap. There’s anger behind them, but worse than that. She's hurting.\n\n \n\n \"You get to wave your hand and make things happen. You get to fight back. And I’m just supposed to sit here and let you handle everything? I’m supposed to just… hope you know what’s best for me?\"\n\n \n\n Her hands ball into fists. \"I found someone who could actually help.\"\n\n \n\n A chill runs down your spine. \"Who?\"\n\n \n\n Emily scoffs. \"Oh, because only your friends can know about magic?\"\n\n \n\n She gestures at the trinket.\n\n \n\n \"Her name’s Siobhan. She works at that carnival that just came to town. And unlike you, she actually listened to me.\"\n\n \n\n You take a breath, steadying yourself. \"Emily, this thing -\"\n\n \n \n \"It’s a bracelet.\" She cuts you off, defiant. \"And once I activate it, I’ll have my own power. I’ll be able to stop these curses. Without you.\"\n\n \n You step closer, eyes locked on the trinket. \"Emily, what are you doing?\"\n\n \n\n She doesn’t flinch. She doesn’t hesitate. Instead, she glares at you. Emily smirks, leaning back slightly, completely unfazed by your reaction. \"You wouldn’t get it, .\"\n\n \n\n Her voice is light, airy - almost mocking.\n\n \n\n \"I found someone who could help me. Siobhan. She works at that carnival that just came to town.\" She gestures at the trinket. \"She was more understanding than you’ve ever been.\"\n\n \n\n You swallow hard, feeling the magic radiate from the bracelet, dangerously unstable. \"Emily, you don’t know if this will stop the curses.\"\n\n \n\n \"No,*you* don’t know,\" she counters, her smile sharpening. \"This isn’t about stopping them.\"\n\n \n\n Your breath catches. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n Emily tilts her head, twisting a loose strand of hair between her fingers. \"Why stop them, when I can make them work for me?\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes glint in the candlelight, and a shiver runs down your spine. \"I’m going to shape things the way they should be. And you? You’re either with me… or in my way.\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You hesitate.\n\n \n\n The urge to tell her this is dangerous is paramount. That she’s playing with something she doesn’t understand. But then you see the way her hands tremble. The way her voice shakes with frustration. You didn’t realize she had reached her breaking point.\n\n \n\n Maybe this… maybe this would be better for everyone.\n\n \n\n \"Okay.\"\n\n \n\n Emily blinks, startled. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n You sigh. \"I’m sorry. I didn’t realize how much this was hurting you. If this is what you need -\"\n\n \n \n She doesn’t wait for you to finish.\n\n \n\n Emily places a hand over the bracelet, her voice steadying as she speaks. \"A desperate gift, for those whose greed overpowers their need, bind this bracelet's power to me and only me.\"\n\n \n\n Whose greed overpowers their need?\n\n \n\n You barely have time to react before a surge of energy explodes outward.\n\n \n\n A blinding flash of light fills the room.\n\n \n\n Darkness takes you.\n\n \n You hesitate, then nod. \"Maybe you’re right.\"\n\n \n\n Emily frowns. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n You sigh. “We need all the help we can get. A little more magic -”\n\n \n\n She doesn’t wait for you to finish.\n\n \n\n Emily places a hand over the bracelet, her voice steadying as she speaks. \"A desperate gift, for those whose greed overpowers their need, bind this bracelet's power to me and only me.\"\n\n \n\n Whose greed overpowers their need?\n\n \n\n The moment she speaks the words, the magic ignites.\n\n \n\n A crimson glow bursts outward, wrapping around her like a second skin.\n\n \n \n The air crackles with power.\n\n \n\n Then, a flash of light.\n\n \n\n Darkness takes you.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You come to with a sharp inhale, the feeling of cold wood beneath you grounding you as your mind slowly catches up.\n\n \n\n Your vision is blurry at first, colors bleeding together in the living room. The scent of smoke and burnt-out wax fills the air.\n\n \n\n As your head clears, you look around. The candles are all blown out. The chalk markings on the floor are smudged and broken. But the magic lingers.\n\n \n\n And at the center of it all, Emily sits, grinning. Her fingers brushing over the bracelet on her wrist.\n\n \n\n She glows.\n\n \n\n Not just figuratively. There’s still a soft shimmer of magic clinging to her, a faint golden hue that pulses and settles into her skin.\n\n \n\n You push yourself up, still dazed. \"Emily…?\"\n\n \n\n She looks up at you, and something is different. Her smile is brighter. Carefree. Almost… vacant.\n\n \n\n \"I feel protected,\" she murmurs, flexing her fingers as if testing out the energy within her.\n\n \n\n \"Like the curses can't touch me anymore.\"\n\n \n\n The way she says it, so casually, so assured, makes your stomach twist.\n\n \n\n You study her closer, and that’s when it hits you. It’s not just the magic. It’s her. The way she holds herself - looser, more relaxed. The way she tilts her head, a practiced ease to it. The way her lips curve into a soft, effortless smile.\n\n \n\n You swallow hard. She looks more like she fits into the town than ever.\n\n \n\n She stands, still fiddling with the amulet. Her posture seems straighter, more pronounced. She walks across the room, hips swaying, a bounce in her steps. \n\n \n\n “Time to show Charlton what I’m made of,” she murmurs, a sultry tone to her voice.\n\n \n\n Without another word, she walks past you and walks upstairs to her room.\n\n \n You come to with a jolt, gasping for breath. The air feels thick, charged, like static clinging to your skin.\n\n \n\n Blinking hard, you try to orient yourself. The room is dim, but the candles are out. The chalk circle is broken, the markings distorted. But that’s not what draws your attention.\n\n \n\n Emily sits in the middle of the ritual space, cross-legged, head tilted back slightly as she watches the bracelet on her wrist. She’s grinning. And she’s glowing.\n\n \n\n Not just from residual magic. There's power to her. It hums around her, a soft crimson shimmer still flickering at the edges of her skin, seeping into her like it belongs there.\n\n \n\n You push yourself upright. \"Emily?\"\n\n \n\n She finally looks at you, eyes gleaming. \"I feel powerful.\"\n\n \n\n She flexes her fingers, her movements slow, deliberate. Like she’s savoring the sensation. \"Like the curses are mine to play with.\"\n\n \n\n Your chest tightens and you watch as she lifts her wrist, admiring the bracelet like a prized possession. Something is wrong.\n\n \n\n She’s changed. Not just magically, but in presence. Her smile is wider. More confident. Too confident. Her posture is practiced, poised. Effortless.\n\n \n\n She stands, still fiddling with the bracelet. She walks across the room, hips swaying, a bounce in her steps. \n\n \n\n “Time to show Charlton what I can do,” she murmurs, a sultry tone to her voice. \n\n \n\n Without another word, she walks past you and walks upstairs to her room.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n You move before she can activate it. Emily screams as you lunge forward, breaking the chalk circle and snatching up the bracelet.\n\n \n\n But the moment your fingers close around it crumbles into ash. The remnants fall through your fingers, landing like sand on the floor.\n\n \n\n Emily stares at the remnants, her face shocked, then furious. \"You just couldn’t let me have this, could you?\" she snaps.\n\n \n\n You don’t answer. You can’t.\n\n \n\n She lets out a bitter laugh, shaking her head. Then sighs. \"There’s no point going on anymore.\"\n\n \n\n You frown, something uneasy settling in your stomach. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n \n\n Emily looks at you, darkly. \"With school, I mean.\" Her voice is flat, defeated. \"There’s no point in trying. I can’t win.\"\n\n \n\n “I can help,” you plead.\n\n \n\n “Can you?” she asks. “I don’t see you helping. At all.”\n\n \n\n She turns away, shoulders hunched. \"I may as well just accept it. You win, Charlton. I’m done with trying to resist. I may as well just flunk out now, get a full time job at the hotel as a maid or something.\"\n\n \n\n You open your mouth. To say what, you don’t know. But before you can speak, she walks past you, heading upstairs.\n\n \n\n “Do what you want. I don’t care, anymore.”\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You don’t hesitate, lunging forward, breaking the chalk line and grabbing the bracelet.\n\n \n\n Emily screams in rage, but it’s too late. The moment your fingers close around it the magic dies. The bracelet turns to ash. The remnants fall through your fingers, landing like sand on the floor.\n\n \n\n Silence fills the room.\n\n \n\n Then Emily laughs coldly. \"You really are pathetic, .\"\n\n \n\n She glares at you, something venomous in her gaze. \"You’re holding me back. Keeping magic all to yourself.\" Her voice lowers, biting. \"Fine. But don’t expect me to play along anymore.\"\n\n \n\n “Emily,” you try. “What’s got into you?”\n\n \n\n “Like you care,” she spits. “I just wanted power. Like yours. But you’re so scared of sharing it. That you’ll lose the only thing that makes you special.”\n\n \n\n She crosses her arms. \"I’ll fail. Our parents will be furious. And then? Your perfect little plan to escape Charlton will be ruined.\"\n\n \n\n She turns away, heading upstairs without another word.\n\n \n\n “Can’t wait for you to see my next report card,” she says.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"I was invited to the school today,” you tell your sister. “Had a meeting with Lydia Carmichael. The career advisor.\"\n\n \n\n Emily frowns slightly. \"Aren't career advisors supposed to talk to students?\"\n\n \n\n You shrug. \"Apparently not in Charlton.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s expression shifts into something wary. \"Okay... So, what was this meeting about?\"\n\n \n\n \"Because you're doing well in school, they want to give you an internship.\"\n\n \n\n Emily’s wariness deepens. \"What kind of internship?\"\n\n \n\n This causes you to exhale. “At Thompson’s Repairs,\" you explain. \"On Friday afternoons. You’ll be working reception with Annie. As a secretary.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily groans, shaking her head. \"A receptionist?\" She exhales sharply. \"Is that the idea of work experience in this town?”\n\n \n\n You raise your eyebrow and smile a little. Emily sighs. “Why am I even surprised?”\n\n \n\n “Come on,” you try to assure her. “You know the plan. Keep your grades up. Graduate. Then the world is yours.”\n\n \n\n “I know,” she admits. “But doing what Annie does every day. Do I really need to sink to making coffee for Mr. Thompson and doting on sleazy salesmen for grades? It feels so… cheap.”\n\n \n\n “Just focus on the end goal,” you say. “It’s not long until you get through your final year. And you get to skip on Friday afternoons too.” \n\n \n\n She looks away, lips pressed into a thin line. Then, with visible reluctance, she nods. \"Fine. If it helps my grades, I guess I’ll do it. Thanks for sorting it out. At least I won’t have to put up with the boys perving on me in that gym.\" \n\n \n\n The final thought is enough for Emily to lose some of her skepticism. “Thanks again,” she says to you, more genuinely.\n\n \n Emily brightens immediately, eyes lighting up with excitement. \"Seriously? Finally, a way out of that stuffy school and into the real world!\"\n\n \n\n She grins. \"A secretary position is, like, one of the best jobs a girl can get, anyway. This could give me a head start for when I finally graduate. And will Gordon and Clive be around in the afternoons? Clive seems fun, and Gordon’s got… an appealing look.\"\n\n \n\n You give her a flat stare. \"This is to increase your grades, Emily.\"\n\n \n\n She waves a dismissive hand. \"Yeah, yeah, I know.\" Then, with a giggle, she muses, \"I guess I’ll need to swing by Evans’ Department Store for a wardrobe refresh. Mr. Thompson probably expects his secretaries to dress to impress. What type of skirt does Annie usually wear?\"\n\n \n\n You don’t answer. Emily flashes you a grin, still clearly thrilled by the prospect of spending time at Thompson’s Repairs.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “I got a call from Charlton School,” you tell her. “About you.\"\n\n \n\n She pauses, turning with a curious frown. “Me? What about?”\n\n \n\n “It was the school receptionist. She said your grades have been improving. Said your teachers were impressed.”\n\n \n\n Emily smiles faintly, proud but wary. “Okay… so what’s the catch?”\n\n \n\n You clear your throat. “Mr. Stitch offered you extra lessons. On Tuesdays. At lunchtime.”\n\n \n\n \n Her face falls. “Of course he did. More strange lessons from a strange school.”\n\n \n\n You tilt your head. “You’re not happy?”\n\n \n\n “I don’t know,” she says. “It just feels... off. The school is trouble. You know it. I’d bet my life this won’t be good for me.”\n\n \n\n “I get it,” you say. “But Emily, you’ve been noticed. By the headmaster. That kind of attention - turning it down? That would raise suspicion.”\n\n \n\n She crosses her arms, thinking. She is far from convinced.\n\n \n\n “If you go,” you add, “you can just play the part. Get your grades boosted. Look like a model student. That draws attention away from you, not toward you.”\n\n \n\n Emily shifts uneasily. “Do I really have to go?”\n\n \n\n You hesitate, then offer gently, “If it means that much to you… I’ll go. I’ll use the amulet. You stay home. I’ll sit in Stitch’s office for you.”\n\n \n\n She blinks, taken aback. Then she nods, slowly. “You’d really do that?”\n\n \n\n “Of course.”\n\n \n\n For the first time in the conversation, her shoulders relax. “Thanks,” she murmurs. “I don’t like this. But if you’re there, at least for some of them, we’ll both be able to deal with it.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Emily groans, flopping onto the sofa. “Ugh, seriously? Extra lessons? With him?”\n\n \n\n You try to ease the tension. “It’s only once a week. It could really help your grades.”\n\n \n\n She gives you a look. “The only good part of school is lunch. That’s when I get to see people. Now I’ve got to waste it sitting in Mr. Stitch’s creepy office?”\n\n \n\n “You don’t know that it’ll be bad,” you say carefully. “If you do well, you’ll impress the headmaster. That could --”\n\n \n\n “Oh my god, listen to yourself,” she snaps, laughing in disbelief. “Impressing teachers? As if I care about that. And what if anyone finds out? I’ll be branded a geek. Are you going to sign me up for weekend library trips next? Or maybe I can join a little computer club too?”\n\n \n\n You sigh, frustrated. “Emily, come on. This isn’t about that. It’s about --”\n\n \n\n “If you’re so enthusiastic about it,” she cuts you off, standing, “you go.”\n\n \n\n You blink. “What?”\n\n \n\n “I’ll stay home. Read a magazine. You can sit in Stitch’s office and be the perfect little pupil.”\n\n \n\n She waves her hand dismissively and sighs. “Whatever. I’ll see how I feel on the day.”\n\n \n\n You’re not sure if she’ll show up to the lesson. If she doesn't, you realise, you might have to step in here yourself to protect her.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \"I got called into Thompson’s office today,\" you begin.\n\n \n\n Emily gives you a look. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n You nod. \"He said it’s not working out. The system’s still a mess. Orders, invoices, suppliers. He rattled off everything that’s gone wrong. He’s putting Annie behind-the-scenes and wants me to cover reception.\"\n\n \n\n Emily frowns. \"Seriously?\"\n\n \n\n \"Seriously,\" you say. \"He’s getting a guy called Theodore to do some freelance development. Meanwhile, I sit behind the desk, smile at customers, answer phones. For all intents and purposes, I’m now a receptionist. \n\n \n\n Your sister stares back at you. Words not coming.\n\n \n\n “I just...” you say, sighing. “I don’t know how to do this anymore, Em. Keep my work performance up and help you.\"\n\n \n\n Your shoulders slump as you shake your head. \"I’m trying to investigate the school, but this job keeps a roof over our heads. If I lose that... it doesn’t matter what happens to you at school. If only I could be in two places at once.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily looks at you in a strange way. Thoughtful. A little wary. \"Maybe there is.\"\n\n \n\n You blink. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n \"A way to be in two places at once.\" She meets your eyes. \"Look, I know it sounds crazy. But after everything we’ve been through - the amulet, magic, the curses - can you really say it’s impossible?\"\n\n \n\n You start to protest, but she cuts you off.\n\n \n\n \"Just think about it. Magic is real. There has to be a spell out there. Something that could help. You should talk to someone.\"\n\n \n\n “What are you suggesting?” you ask her. “That I make a clone of myself?”\n\n \n\n Her brown eyes gaze deep into you. “Sort of. But instead of a clone… maybe there’s a better use of my time than sitting around whilst you’re at school.”\n\n \n\n Her voice is steady, serious. You can tell she’s not joking. “If you can transform,” she adds. “Why can’t I?”\n\n \n Emily looks up at you, unimpressed. \"You had one job. Provide a roof. And now that’s too much?\"\n\n \n\n You grit your teeth. \"That’s not fair.\"\n\n \n\n She rolls her eyes. \"Maybe I should go to work while you go back to school.\"\n\n \n\n Her words hang in the air. You frown. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n \n\n She raises her eyebrows. \"Maybe you should talk to someone. Someone who knows something about all this magic you’re messing with. And you go to school, as me. And I’ll take your job.\"\n\n \n\n “You’re not suggesting --” you begin.\n\n \n\n “I am,” she cuts you off. “I have enough to worry about without the threat of being out on the street. If you can’t stump up and manage to balance school with your job, then maybe I should give it a go.”\n\n \n\n She looks back at you, almost challenging. \"Think it over. Not like it could make things any worse.\"\n\n \n \n\n You stand in stunned silence, her words echoing in your brain. Could Emily really do this?\n\n \n\n Would you want her to?\n\n \n\n If you do, you need to talk to someone. Someone who understands magic. Someone who might be able to help.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n “Can I ask you a favour?” you begin. “I need someone to cover a shift. At the hotel.”\n\n \n\n \n She turns slowly to face you. Her brow furrows. “Someone?”\n\n \n\n “We need the cash, Em,” you say. “Please.”\n\n \n\n She sighs. “That place gives me the creeps.”\n\n \n\n You nod. “I know. But it’s necessary. Just one shift. We could really do with the extra money.”\n\n \n\n She looks at you, uneasy. “I don’t like it. I’ve seen what it’s like. But… fine.”\n\n \n\n Without another word, she gets up, grabs her coat. “No time like the present,” she says, resigned to the request.\n\n \n\n Giving you a polite smile, she walks out the door.\n\n \n She turns slowly to face you. She stares at you, outraged. “Oh, someone? You want me to work there? In that uniform?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “It’s necessary.”\n\n \n\n Emily scoffs. “You’re unbelievable.”\n\n \n\n You nod. “Just one shift. We need the money.”\n\n \n\n Emily throws her hands up, sighing dramatically. “Always with you, money. When are you going to think about me?”\n\n \n\n “I do,” you begin. “With the school…”\n\n \n\n You trail off at the sight of her scowl. Once she’s sure you’re not going to pursue that matter further, she grabs her coat and storms out.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You glance over at Emily. “Think you could cover another shift tonight?”\n\n \n\n \n She sighs, already knowing what you’re going to say. “At the hotel again?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “Just for tonight. We’re a bit short.”\n\n \n\n Her lips press together, reluctant. “That place makes my skin crawl…”\n\n \n\n But after a moment, she stands. “Fine. I’ll get my coat.”\n \n \n She groans, tossing her phone aside. “Ugh. Again?”\n\n \n\n “We need the money,” you reply.\n\n \n\n She rolls her eyes, dragging herself up from the couch. “Whatever. Let me grab my coat.”\n\n \n\n She mutters something under her breath as she heads for the door, but doesn’t stop.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You spend the evening half-watching TV, but your mind drifts constantly. Imagining Emily at the hotel. In that uniform. Under Lennox’s watchful gaze. With Pierre barking orders. You wonder how she’s handling it.\n\n \n\n Eventually, the door clicks open.\n\n \n\n \n She steps in quietly, cheeks flushed, eyes slightly glassy.\n\n \n\n “How’d it go?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She shrugs, trying to seem fine. “Pierre… that chef. He's not a nice man. I just kept my head down. Washed dishes. Got through it.”\n\n \n\n There’s a pause.\n\n \n\n “I guess… I can go again. If you need me to.”\n\n \n\n “Only if you feel comfortable doing it,” you reply.\n\n \n\n She shrugs. “I just need to get used to that kind of attention. That’s what girls in Charlton do, right?”\n\n \n\n She trails off, not meeting your eyes. And walks upstairs, silently.\n \n \n She tosses her bag on the sofa. “Well, that was horrific,” she mutters.\n\n \n\n You look up.\n\n \n\n “I had to deal with Pierre. That cook. He’s such a pervert,” she says with a shudder. “But I made decent tips, at least. And no one saw me. Thank God.”\n\n \n\n She smooths down her coat, trying to shake off the night. “If I have to keep doing this, at least it’s in the kitchen. Out of sight.”\n\n \n\n “Thank you,” you say, quietly.\n\n \n\n She looks to you, pulling at her hair. It looks greasy. “I need a shower. Good night.”\n\n \n\n You watch as she walks upstairs, leaving you alone.\n\n \n \n \n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n “I wanted to let you know,” you say. “I’ve taken the job. At the Charlton Hotel.”\n\n \n\n \n She pauses, blinking. “You’ve taken the job? As me?”\n\n \n\n You nod.\n\n \n\n Emily frowns. “That’s… weird. I mean, you working there as me? That hotel gives me the creeps. I’ve heard the stories about how they treat the maids.”\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, more anxious than annoyed. “I hope you know what you’re doing. I wouldn’t want to work there.”\n\n \n\n Then she stops. Her brow furrows. “Wait. That’s not what you meant, is it?” She crosses her arms. “You don’t actually expect me to work there… do you?”\n\n \n That gets her attention. “As me?” she asks, eyes wide. “You’ve taken a maid job at the Charlton Hotel as me?”\n\n \n\n You nod.\n\n \n\n Emily makes a strangled sound. “Do you know what people would say if they saw me in one of those uniforms? At that place? I have a reputation, you know. And people talk.”\n\n \n\n She folds her arms, clearly disturbed. “I hope you know what you’re doing. I wouldn’t want to work there.”\n\n \n\n Then she freezes. Her eyes narrow. “Wait. That’s not what you meant, is it?”\n\n \n\n Her tone sharpens. “You don’t mean you expect me to work there… do you?”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n She exhales, a little relief in her shoulders. “Oh. Okay. That’s… different, I guess.”\n\n \n\n Still, her brow creases. “I don’t know what they’ll expect from you, though. That place is strange. The uniform, the way they talk to the girls… it just feels off.”\n\n \n\n You try to offer reassurance. “It’s just a part-time job. Some extra cash. And another way into the hotel.”\n\n \n\n She doesn’t look convinced. “I hope you know what you’re doing.” Then, more softly: “I wouldn’t want to work there.”\n\n \n\n You smile. “You won’t have to.”\n\n \n\n She gives you a grateful look. “Thanks.”\n \n \n She stares at you like you’ve just grown a second head. “Wait… you want to go work there? As me?”\n\n \n\n You nod.\n\n \n\n Her eyes narrow. “Why would you even want to do that? I thought you were trying to get us out of all this, not dive deeper.”\n\n \n\n You stay calm. “It’s a way into the hotel. We need eyes inside. Plus, tips.”\n\n \n\n Emily folds her arms. “I don’t care about the money. What I care about is my reputation. You acting like me, in that uniform?”\n\n \n\n She steps closer. “Being a maid… it’s just beneath me. And you’re going to risk ruining my chance to break out of this nerdy little reputation I’ve somehow gotten myself.“\n\n \n\n You frown. “I didn’t know you thought like that.”\n\n \n\n “I can’t be a bookworm all my life,” she replies. “It’s hardly appealing to guys. So whatever reasons you’ve got for doing this weird little activity - and I mean weird - just watch it. I don’t want to show up at school and find out I’ve been making fluttering lashes for tips. It’s so humiliating.”\n\n \n\n She turns, muttering. “Just… watch yourself.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n\n \n Emily’s face falls immediately. “Wait, me? You want me to work there?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “We need the money. And the access. It’s just a few shifts. An evening or two.”\n\n \n\n She shakes her head. “You’ve seen what it’s like. Andrea’s always worn out, and the way they talk to her like she’s some… showpiece.”\n\n \n\n You try to explain, to soften it. “It’s just part-time. You won’t be alone. And I’ll make sure you’re okay.”\n\n \n\n But Emily doesn’t let it go. “You’re supposed to be helping me get through school. This doesn’t help. It’s just more Charlton. And the more I see of it… the harder it is to stay myself.”\n\n \n\n There’s a long pause.\n\n \n\n Then finally, she nods. “Fine. But only because you asked.”\n\n \n “What?” Emily barks. “You want me to do it?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “We need the money. You know that.”\n\n \n\n Emily’s eyes flash. “No. You need the money. Why should I be punished because you can’t keep a job?”\n\n \n\n You bristle. “The only reason I lost my job was because I was investigating the school. For you.”\n\n \n\n There’s a long silence.\n\n \n\n Then Emily mutters, almost to herself, “Maybe I overreacted. Maybe this town’s not so bad.”\n\n \n\n You blink. “What?”\n\n \n\n She waves it off. “Nothing.”\n\n \n\n She glares at you. “Fine. I’ll do your stupid maid job. But if anyone at school sees me in that outfit or hears a rumour, I swear, I’ll make sure you hear about it first.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \"I've been thinking,\" you begin. \"I want you to stop working at the hotel at the weekends. I don't think it's good for you.\"\n\n \n\n \n Emily throws you a look. For the first time in a while, you see hope on her face. \"But I thought we needed the money?\"\n\n \n\n \"There are other ways to get money, Em,\" you say. \"Ones that don't rely on you having to put up with... that.\"\n\n \n\n When she looks as if she's going to protest, you interject. \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. If we get really strapped, I'll let you know and you can still work a shift. Just not all the time. Maybe you could spend some of that time studying.\"\n\n \n\n For a moment, you think she's going to continue to challenge you. But then she sighs. A deep sigh, letting out all her anxieties. \"Thanks . I thought I was going to go mad if I did another shift there.\"\n\n \n\n You smile. It's enough for your sister to run up to you, throwing her arms around your neck. You hug her back. You hear a few sniffles from your shoulder.\n\n \n\n After a while, she pulls back. Her eyes are blotchy. She offers you a smile again. This looks like Emily. You're struck by how rare it is to see her these days.\n\n \n\n She nods to you, then retreats, sitting down on the sofa. Her smile not wavering.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n Emily narrows her eyebrows, almost scowling. \"But I thought we needed the money?\"\n\n \n\n \"There are other ways to get money, Em,\" you say. \"Ones that don't rely on you having to put up with... that.\"\n\n \n\n A cold smile appears on her face. \"What if I wanted to put up with that?\" She arches an eyebrow. \"It's not so bad, after all. No one sees me. There's no rumours at school. And at least I get to have a little fun at weekends. That's in short supply around here.\"\n\n \n\n You hold back your frustration. \"I don't think Charlton fun is good for you,\" you reply. \"You shouldn't be working in that uniform, cleaning up after guests. You should be...\"\n\n \n\n Her glare causes you to trail off. \"Should be what? Say it, . You think I should be confined to my room. Studying.\"\n\n \n\n \"You need to graduate,\" you begin.\n\n \n\n \"Maybe I do. Maybe I don't. But school isn't the be all and end all of life. What's the point in being a teenager if all I do is worry about my grades?\"\n\n \n\n You sigh, trying to come to terms with this version of your sister. \"It's just for another year.\"\n\n \n\n Emily lets out a deep sigh, then throws herself down on the sofa. \"That might not be long for you, but it feels like a lifetime to me.\" She pouts. \n \n\n \"You can still work the odd shift,\" you try. \"Just not every weekend. When school allows.\"\n\n \n\n \"And who decides when it allows, I wonder,\" she retorts. When you don't answer, she huffs and turns on the TV. Ignoring you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “I did it to get us both a foot in the door,” you say quickly. “The money’s good, and it’s a way into Charlton Hotel. We need intel. And it’s just a part-time maid job, nothing dangerous.”\n\n \n\n Emily’s expression hardens. “It’s not about the job. It’s about trust. I walk around town and Mr. Lennox is treating me like I’ve already started mopping floors and curtsying.”\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, visibly upset. “And to think you’ve been dressing up like that - as me - without even talking to me first?”\n\n \n\n You try to speak, but she holds up a hand. “I get why you did it. But this wasn’t okay.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Emily stares at you, jaw tight. “You didn’t think to tell me before deciding to tarnish my reputation?”\n\n \n\n You open your mouth to explain, but she’s already shaking her head.\n\n \n\n “What are people at school going to think? That I’m so poor I’ve had to take a cleaning job? Some of the boys might enjoy the thought…” you notice her mind drifting a little, but soon returns to you. “But that’s not the point.”\n\n \n\n She jabs a finger toward you. “A maid job is beneath me. You want to sneak around, fine. But think about my reputation next time.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n\n \n You let out a breath. “I didn’t plan to tell you this way. But… I needed the job.”\n\n \n\n “But… that job,” Emily lets out. “That uniform.”\n\n \n\n You sigh, slumping your shoulders. “It’s just the way things are going, Em. I didn’t enjoy it.”\n\n \n\n But is that really true?\n\n \n\n Emily’s expression softens. She walks closer. “I didn’t know money was that bad,” she murmurs. “You should have said something.”\n\n \n\n You shrug. “It didn’t feel like something I wanted to talk about.”\n\n \n\n She nods slowly. “I still wish you’d told me. But… maybe I could do a few shifts. Ease the burden.”\n\n \n\n You look up in surprise. She shrugs. “You’re not the only one who can wear a short skirt.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Emily crosses her arms. “Yeah, well… what did you think would happen? You take a job where your whole identity is about cleaning up after people and then act surprised when it makes you feel gross?”\n\n \n\n You wince, but say nothing.\n\n \n\n You let out a breath. “I didn’t plan to tell you this way. But… I needed the job.”\n\n \n\n “And that was the one that appealed to you?” Emily retorts, almost smirking.\n\n \n\n You sigh, slumping your shoulders. “It’s just the way things are going, Em. I didn’t enjoy it.”\n\n \n\n “And doing it as me?” she says, with a scowl. “You want to play dress-up, that’s your choice. But next time, leave me out of it.”\n\n \n\n She glares at you a moment longer, slumping on the sofa. Sulking.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n Beginning with the basics, you teach Emily how to answer the phones, greet customers, schedule appointments for Clive and Gordon, and manage Thompson’s calendar. You stumble a lot - it’s all new to you – but you get through the basics. None of it is particularly hard. It’s repetitive. Monotonous. Emily picks it up without a challenge.\n\n \n\n Then the bell above the front door rings.\n\n \n\n Dan strolls in, loud as ever. You can smell the alcohol on his breath from across the desk. \"Afternoon,\" he says, grinning.\n\n \n\n Then Dan’s eyes land on Emily. His grin widens. \"Well, well. Look who it is. The elusive Miss Phillips. I was starting to think your kept you locked up somewhere.\"\n\n \n\n You shift uncomfortably. “Emily’s here to do an internship,” you tell him. “I’m just showing her what she needs to do.”\n\n \n\n “I always saw you as a naughty schoolgirl rather than a teacher, Annie,” Dan snarks, a cruel smile forming. “But I'm sure she's had enough of being taught by the secretary. Maybe you'd like a few lessons from me, love? There's a few things I'd love to teach you.”\n\n \n\n \n You glance over to your sister, watching Emily squirm back into her seat. She tries to avoid his looks, but he moves to hang over the counter and look directly down at her. \"Come on, just being friendly. In fact,” he says, his face coming closer to Emily’s. “She and I should have a little chat. I can tell her about how things really work around here. And Friday afternoons are so dull.”\n\n \n\n “She’s here to work, Dan,” you tell him flatly. “If Mr. Thompson sees her slacking off, it’ll go straight back to the school.\"\n\n \n\n \n “Don’t worry about Thompson,” he replies. Then his voice drops, just a little. \"In fact, maybe she could tell me about why her deserves a second chance. I could have a word with the boss, if I'm so inclined.\"\n\n “Don’t worry about Thompson,” he replies. Then his voice drops, just a little. \"Unless I’m not occupied this afternoon. Then I might find myself in his office. Talking about how her ’s not even getting the basics right. Shame, really.\"\n\n \n\n He grins at Emily, lingering a second too long, the breath of alcohol invading her face. “What do you say, Miss Phillips? Fancy keeping me occupied?\"\n\n \n\n Emily looks up at him, then to you. Waiting for guidance.\n\n \n You glance over to your sister, but you’re surprised to see her coyly looking up at Dan. A girlish giggle escapes her mouth. Dan hears it and grins. \n\n \n\n “See, she’s okay with a little banter,” he tells you, his predatory eyes not moving from Emily. \"What do you say, Miss. Phillips. Fancy a little chat in the back of the office? I’ll let you know how things really work around here.”\n\n \n\n Before Emily can reply, you interject. “She’s here to work, Dan. If Mr. Thompson sees her slacking off, it’ll go straight back to the school.\"\n\n \n\n “Don’t need to worry about Thompson with me around,” he says, but now his words firmly targeted at Emily. “You’re not as big of a stick in the mud as your , are you? Want to see how the closers celebrate their big deals?”\n\n \n\n Looking over to Emily, you notice her relaxed posture and small grin. She runs a fingernail across her lips before she sees you watching. She quickly drops her hand back to her side, trying to regain some composure.\n\n \n\n \n “Don’t worry about Thompson,” he replies. Then his voice drops, just a little. \"In fact, maybe she could tell me about why her deserves a second chance. I could have a word with the boss, if I'm so inclined.\"\n\n “Come on, Annie. Let her out to play. You wouldn’t want me to be on mine own on a Friday afternoon, would you? I might grow bored and have a chat with Thompson about how well is doing with our system. Or how badly, to rephrase.”\n \n\n Emily looks back at you, waiting for your direction. Her creeping smile at the edge of her mouth tells you what she wants to do, but you are sure nothing good can come of it.\n\n \n \n You spend the afternoon walking Emily through more reception tasks. Calendar reminders, rescheduling calls, chasing up Gordon’s notes. She's still attentive, but less tentative now. Either she’s getting the hang of it… or getting too comfortable.\n\n \n\n The bell chimes. Dan again.\n\n \n\n “Look who’s back,” he grins, slouching against the counter, eyes already drifting to Emily. “Was hoping I’d run into you again, Miss Phillips.”\n\n \n\n \n Emily stiffens. Her fingers hesitate over the keyboard as Dan leans in. “Thought maybe we’d pick up our little chat,” he says, voice low. “You seemed real keen.”\n\n \n\n You cut in quickly. “Emily’s still here to work, Dan.”\n\n \n\n \n Dan’s smile fades slightly. “She’s allowed a break, isn’t she?” Then, quieter: “Offer still stands. I could put in a good word about her . See if Thompson would take them back.\"\n\n Dan’s smile fades slightly. “She’s allowed a break, isn’t she?” Then, quieter: “Be a shame if I had to fill Thompson in on how her has been doing lately.”\n \n \n\n Emily looks to you. Nervous, expectant. Waiting for your lead.\n\n \n Emily barely looks up from the desk, but there’s a flicker of amusement in her eyes. She toys with her necklace as Dan leans closer.\n\n \n\n “Good to see you’re still around,” he says. “You learn that trick with your necklace from Annie, or are you born this way?”\n\n \n\n She giggles softly.\n\n \n\n “Reckon she’s earned a coffee, don’t you?” Dan asks, not even looking at you now. “Or we could step into the back and talk about her future here.”\n\n \n\n You step in, your tone sharp. “She’s working.”\n\n \n\n \n Dan's smile fades slightly. “She’s allowed a break, isn’t she?” Then, quieter: “Offer still stands. I could put in a good word about her . See if Thompson would take them back.”\n\n Dan shrugs, unbothered. “Your call. But maybe Thompson needs a reminder of how things used to run smoother.”\n \n \n\n Emily gives you a sly look, waiting for permission.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <>\n\n \n \n You’ve been waiting too long.\n\n \n\n Whatever Dan wanted to “chat” about, it’s taking more than a few minutes. The front desk feels quieter without Emily nearby, but it’s not in a peaceful way. It’s the kind that tightens your chest. You keep glancing toward the door, hoping to hear footsteps. Nothing.\n\n \n\n Then, at last, the door opens.\n\n \n\n \n Emily steps out, head lowered, cheeks pale. She doesn't speak. You hear Dan's voice bellow out as she walks through the door. \"See you again soon, sweetheart.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes flick to you, but only briefly. Instead she sits down in silence. A long moment passes, but you hear her sigh. \"Alright. What's next?\"\n\n \n\n You open your mouth. “Emily…”\n\n \n\n She cuts you off with a look. \"Don't. He's just a creep. Enough said. You were showing my the filing on the server.\"\n\n \n\n You monotonously walk through the details of how to file documents across the network, but your voice is flat and emotionless. Emily keeps her comments to a minimum, focusing on the work at hand.\n\n \n\n The last hour of the day drips away. Soon, it is time for Emily to leave.\n\n \n\n \"I'll see you at home,\" you say. \"I've got to finish up.\"\n\n \n\n She nods. Then silently picks up her bag and walks out the door without a word.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n The door swings open mid-laugh. Dan’s voice is louder than it needs to be: “Maybe next time, you can show me how you do it.”\n\n \n\n Emily stands in the doorway, looking back over her shoulder into the office. Her voice, lowered and sultry, sings with amusement. “Maybe I will.”\n\n \n\n She saunters back to the desk, cheeks flushed, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. There’s a new bounce in her step, something performative in the way she smooths her skirt and pretends not to notice your stare.\n\n \n\n You lower your voice. “You should be careful with him. He’s not --”\n\n \n\n “He’s not that bad,” she interrupts gently, almost dreamily. “Actually kind of charming, once you get past the bluster.”\n\n \n\n For the next hour you walk her through how to file documents across the network, but her attention is elsewhere. She keeps staring back over to the office door.\n\n \n\n The day soon gets away from you and before you know it, Emily's afternoon has passed.\n\n \n\n \"Thanks for today,\" she says as she picks up her bag. \"And thanks for not being, well, overbearing.\" She grins. \"It's nice to have... some fun.\"\n\n \n\n You watch her go without comment. She bounces over to the door with her grin not leaving her face.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n After some time, you hear the office door creak open. Emily steps out, her face carefully blank. She doesn’t look at you, doesn’t say a word. She walks straight to the desk, drops into the seat, and picks up where she left off like nothing happened.\n\n \n\n For a moment, you just watch her. Eventually, you ask, “Everything okay?”\n\n \n\n She doesn’t look up. “Fine.”\n\n \n\n Taking her at her word, you start to show her some complexity in the calendar scheduling system. She follows along, clicking when told, nodding when expected. There’s no conversation. No connection. Just silence filled with keystrokes.\n\n \n\n As the hour ends, Emily gathers her things.\n\n \n\n “Thanks,” she says, still not meeting your gaze.\n\n \n\n And she leaves. You glance over to the door, wondering what Dan said to her this time.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n The door opens with a laugh. Dan’s, loud and satisfied.\n\n \n\n Emily appears a second later, grinning as she steps out. Her cheeks are flushed again. You catch the soft sway of her hips as she walks back to the desk, seemingly unaware of how it looks.\n\n \n\n She slides into her seat, humming something under her breath.\n\n \n\n You keep your voice low. “Be careful with him.”\n\n \n\n Emily just shrugs. “He’s funny.”\n\n \n\n You blink, unsure what to say. But she’s already leaning back in her chair, half-listening as you try to walk her through filing protocols. She keeps glancing toward the door, as if half-expecting Dan to call her back in.\n\n \n\n Eventually, after another hour passes, she stands and grabs her bag.\n\n \n\n “Catch you later,” she says breezily, already moving for the door. “Same time next week?”\n\n \n\n The door clicks shut behind her.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n\n \n \n Dan finally gets the hint, wordlessly leaving and the door swings shut behind him with a smug little click. Silence fills the front office again. Not peace, but pressure.\n\n \n\n You and Emily don’t speak at first.\n\n \n\n Eventually, you clear your throat and gesture to the screen. “We should get back to the scheduling interface. You were asking about recurring appointments?”\n\n \n\n She nods, wordlessly. You ease back into the teaching.\n\n \n\n \n Emily follows along, if a little slowly. Her focus isn’t quite there, and you can see her glancing now and then at the door Dan walked through. More out of dread than distraction.\n\n \n\n You guide her through the double-booking system and how Clive prefers phone confirmation on anything marked 'tentative.' She listens. She's trying. She doesn't say much, but when she does, her voice is steady.\n\n \n\n By the end of the hour, she’s moving with more confidence again. As she gathers her things, she pauses beside you.\n\n \n\n “Thanks,” she says. “For stepping in. I didn’t… I didn’t want to be alone with him.”\n\n \n\n A beat passes. “I mean, not just because of him. But… it was nice for someone to have my back.”\n \n \n\n She smiles and opens the door, stepping out into Charlton.\n\n \n \nYou smile too, but are distracted by an email. From Thompson. You don't read it, but you can see from the header he's complaining about 's performance again. Dan must have had a word.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n Emily takes her seat, but her posture is closed. You resume your explanation, but she’s barely engaging. Her replies are clipped. Her fingers tap impatiently at the edge of the desk when you pause.\n\n \n\n You walk her through the internal memo process, but she doesn’t seem to be listening. When you ask her to repeat something back, she sighs and leans back. “Do we have to do this? I'm more interested in where you got that dazzling lipgloss.\"\n\n \n\n You give her a look. “We should really focus on work, Emily.”\n\n \n\n She pouts, but returns to looking at the screen. Yet after an hour, you have not gotten much further. Emily seems reluctant to learn, almost purposefully derailing your teaching.\n\n \n\n \"Everything okay?\" you try, as the day draws to a close.\n\n \n\n She sighs. “You wouldn't understand,\" she mutters. \"I just want to have some fun. Not sitting behind a desk. Following the rules.”\n\n \n\n She grabs her bag and stands, moving towards the door. “See you, Annie.”\n\n \n\n The door closes gently. But firmly.\n\n \n \nYou grimace, but are distracted by an email. From Thompson. You don't read it, but you can see from the header he's complaining about 's performance again. Dan must have had a word.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n Dan’s exit is a little less dramatic this time, but no less unwanted. The door shuts. Silence returns.\n\n \n\n You look over to Emily. “Calendar system?” She gives the faintest nod.\n\n \n\n \n She listens quietly as you walk her through the process again. She asks fewer questions this time. Not out of boredom. Just restraint.\n\n \n\n There’s a heaviness to her silence, but not bitterness. Just tiredness. She finishes the tasks without fuss.\n\n \n\n When the hour ends, she picks up her bag.\n\n \n\n “Thanks,” she says simply. “For again keeping him out of my face.”\n\n \n\n And she leaves.\n\n \n \nYou watch her go, but are distracted by an email. From Thompson. You don't read it, but you can see from the header he's complaining about 's performance again. Dan must have had a word.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Emily slouches back in her chair as you begin, not bothering to pretend she’s interested. Her eyes glaze over halfway through the example booking flow.\n\n \n\n After trying for some time, you stop explaining. \"Do we have a problem?\"\n\n \n\n She lets out a quiet snort. “No, no problem. Not at all. Just once again, I’m not allowed to have any fun.”\n\n \n\n No eye contact. No thank-you. Just that.\n\n \n\n She stands, pulls her bag over her shoulder, and walks out without another word.\n\n \n \nYou watch her go, but are distracted by an email. From Thompson. You don't read it, but you can see from the header he's complaining about 's performance again. Dan must have had a word.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n\n “Hey,” you start carefully. “I need to ask you for a favour.”\n\n \n\n Emily looks up, soft smile already on her lips. “Sure. What is it?”\n\n Emily sighs, folding her arms. “Another one? These days your favours aren’t just picking up milk on the way home from school.”\n\n \n \n\n You press on. “This one’s important. I need a personal item from Dennis. Something he treasures. To power the amulet. I need to spend some time as him. See what the boys’ lessons are really like.”\n\n \n\n \n Emily gives you a strange look. “That feels odd… thinking about you. As Dennis.”\n\n Emily wrinkles her nose. “Ew. Why would anyone want to be Dennis? Are you sure this is necessary?”\n\n \n \n\n You nod. “It’s the only way.” A pause, then you add, “The thing is, when I asked him, what he really said he wanted was a photo. Of you.”\n\n \n\n \n Emily’s mouth drops open, nose wrinkling like she’s smelt something foul. “That’s disgusting. I don’t even want to think about why he wants that.”\n\n \n Emily bursts out laughing. “That little perv! He wants a picture of me for his private collection? What a loser.”\n\n \n \n\n You stay quiet. Emily notices, her reaction fading from her face. “Oh no,” she murmurs, staring at you. “Don’t tell me. You want me to pose for him?”\n\n \n\n You don’t answer. The silence is enough.\n\n \n\n Emily fidgets, looking away, then back again. Her voice drops, heavy with reluctance. “What exactly is Dennis expecting out of this?”\n\n \n\n You shrug, playing dumb. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n\n She presses: “You know. What sort of photo is he anticipating?”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \"Just whatever he needs to treasure it,\" you say. \"It needs to mean a lot to him.\"\n\n \n\n \n Her mouth falls open, eyes wide. “I can’t believe you want me to do that,” she says, barely above a whisper.\n\n \n\n Guilt burns in your chest, but you push anyway. “It’s important, Em. This could help fight the curse, help the school. Help you.”\n\n \n\n Emily shakes her head, hurt spilling into her voice. “And my self-worth? Is that worth less than your investigation?”\n\n \n\n The words stop you cold. She swallows and continues, quiet but sharp. “You’re the one asking me to flaunt myself for some pervert, let him take a photo, just so you can get something over him. Is this really the only way forward. Or just the easiest for you?”\n\n \n\n You pause, staring at her. She looks up at you, eyes burning with betrayal. “Well?” she presses.\n\n \n\n Quietly, you repeat. “It’s important.”\n\n \n\n Emily exhales through her nose, rolling her eyes. “It’s always important.” Her voice sharpens. “And Dennis? Do you know what that would happen if he showed people?”\n\n \n\n “He won’t,” you reassure her. “Just warn him not to. He’s too enamoured with you to ever betray that.”\n\n \n\n She stares at the floor a long moment, then sighs. “Fine. I’ll pose. I’ll try and catch him at school, or in the library.”\n\n \n\n “Thanks, Em,” you murmur. “It means a lot.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes flick back to yours, dark and wounded. “Seems all I’m good for in this town,” she replies bitterly, before rising and heading upstairs to her bedroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Emily’s grin widens, eyes glittering. “So how far are we talking?” she teases. “Suggestive? Underwear? Nude? Or do you want me to go full-on sex tape material?”\n\n \n\n You stare, shocked at the words tumbling from her mouth. She scolds you with a sharp laugh. “Don’t look so shocked. You’re the one asking me to flaunt myself for some pervert, let him take a photo, just so you can get something over him. Don’t act like you’re innocent.”\n\n \n\n Hesitating, you watch her dangle her foot on the edge of her heel, smiling back knowingly. “Well?” she presses.\n\n \n\n Quietly, you repeat. “It’s important.”\n\n \n\n Emily rolls her eyes. “It’s always important.” Her voice hardens. “And Dennis? Do you know what that would do to my reputation if he showed people?”\n\n \n\n You answer quickly. “He won’t. Just warn him not to. He’s too enamoured with you to ever betray that.”\n\n \n\n Emily snorts. “Just my luck it’s a nerd that’s infatuated with me. Couldn’t have been Brendan you needed to transform into?”\n\n \n\n “Fine,” she says at last. “I’ll give him a little show. Make him blow his load in his trousers. I’ll try and catch him at school, or in the library.”\n\n \n\n “Thanks, Em,” you murmur. “It means a lot.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes turn dark, almost unreadable. “Seems that’s all I’m good for in this town,” she replies flatly, before slipping off the sofa and heading upstairs to her bedroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You exhale slowly. “Nothing fancy. Just stand there. Let him take something simple. Enough that he’ll treasure it.”\n\n \n\n \n Her shoulders sag, relief mixing with frustration. “So you don’t want me to do anything.., improper?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “No. Just being there will be enough for him. Trust me.”\n\n \n\n Emily studies your face, still doubtful. “I still don’t like it,” she says finally. \n \n\n Quietly, you repeat. “It’s important.”\n\n \n\n “Fine,\" she says, letting out a sigh. \"I’ll try to catch him at school, or maybe the library. I’ll keep it simple.”\n\n \n\n “Thanks, Em,” you murmur. “It means a lot.”\n\n \n\n She turns away, voice bitter. “Seems even that’s all I’m good for in this town,” she says, before rising from the sofa and heading upstairs.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n Emily raises an eyebrow, almost amused. “That’s it? Just stand there and let him snap something dull? Where's the fun in that?\"\n\n \n\n You hesitate. “He’ll value it, Em. That’s what matters.”\n\n \n\n She smirks faintly, a sharp edge in her voice. “If you say so. He'll probably faint just having me in his frame.\"\n\n \n\n \"Don't push him too much,\" you try to warn her. \"It’s important.”\n\n \n\n \"Fine,\" she says at last. \"I'll find him. He hangs around the AV room or library, doesn't he? I'll let him get his precious picture.\"\n \n\n “Thanks, Em,” you murmur. “It means a lot.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes turn dark, almost unreadable. “Seems that’s all I’m good for in this town,” she replies flatly, before slipping off the sofa and heading upstairs to her bedroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Hey Em,\" you begin. \"Can I ask you about something?\"\n\n \n\n Emily stares back at you, nodding absently. “What's up?”\n\n Emily gives you a skeptical look. \"Here we go again.\"\n \n \n\n \"I was wondering if you'd mind me borrowing some things from your wardrobe.\" You wince, aware of how odd this all sounds. \"When I'm you, I mean.\"\n\n \n\n She narrows her eyes, staring back at you. \"You want dress differently?\"\n\n \n\n You inhale, pausing to muster the words. \"I just think it would help. In certain situations.\n\n \n\n \n She looks down at herself, eyes lingering on her own clothes. \"Are you saying that I look a bit plain?\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head, trying to course correct. \"Not at all. You look great.\"\n\n \n\n \"But not enough for when you're pretending to be me?\"\n\n \n\n You study her face, noting her wide eyes and top teeth biting her bottom lip. She seems almost upset, unable to quite meet your eyes.\n\n \n\n \"I didn't mean it like that, Em,\" you reiterate. \"It's just...\"\n\n \n\n \"Just you think you can do better?\"\n\n \n\n You look back at your sister, staring back at you in expectation. \"Some situations just need a change,\" you offer.\n\n \n\n Meeting your eyes for only a moment longer, she sighs and shrugs. \"Sure. Fine. Feel free to use it. I guess it's sort of yours when you're me, anyway.\"\n\n \n\n But her own eyes linger on clothes. As if she's regarding them with a fresh perspective. You decide to leave her, but you feel the weight of responsibility set into you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n A smirk forms on her face. \"You starting to enjoy the perks of being me, ?\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head, trying to deflect. \"I just need to dress differently for other situations.\"\n\n \n\n An eyebrow raises. \"But can't you change my clothes when transform?\"\n\n \n\n \"Yes, but -\"\n\n \n\n Emily interrupts you with her sniggering. \"Sounds to me like you've got a taste of playing dress-up,\" she comments after her giggles die down.\n\n \n\n \"Go ahead,\" she continues. \"There's some new skirts in there that you won't have see before.\" A playful smirk returns to her face. \"Might be nice to taste what it's like to show off a bit of skin.\"\n\n \n\n Emily turns back away from you, conversation over. You guess you have gotten permission to go through her stuff. Yet it doesn't feel like a victory.\n\n \n\n Because maybe she's more right than you think.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

Closest I get these days to using my brain is counting out change.”\n\n \n\n “I've been thinking about it, recently. Did you notice anything strange?\" you continue. \"About the lessons.\"\n\n \n\n \"Nothing special,\" she replies. \"Only what happened to Tandi. Have you seen her recently? She's really different.\"\n\n \n “Hey Flo,” you say. “You went to Charlton Upper School, didn’t you?” \n\n \n\n \"Graduated last year,\" she replies.\n\n \n\n “Did you enjoy your time there?” \n\n \n\n She smiles. “Oh yes! I love all those classes. Learning about all those places far away and past history and how businesses work. I still like reading. In my spare time of course. Closest I get these days to using my brain is counting out change.”\n\n \n\n “Did you notice anything strange?\" you continue. \"About the lessons or the teachers.\" \n\n \n\n \"Nothing special,\" she replies. \"There were favourites. Miss DeBussy had a bunch of girls stay behind after school for extra lessons. But not me.” \n\n \n\n \"Anything else?\" you ask. \n\n \n\n “Only the disappearance of Tandi. But you've heard about that, right?\" \n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n “What happened to Tandi?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n Flo looks at you, her trademark smile fading. “She's changed. You remember how she was, don't you? Popular. Pretty, did well at school. She's like a different person now.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “How?”\n\n \n\n “She spends a lot of time with Annie. They go to the Red Room a lot. And...\" The waitress glances around, worried about talking in spite of the shop being empty. \"I've overheard some customers. They've seen her working at Dicks.”\n\n \n\n Florence pauses, then leans further over the counter towards you. “She’s had some work done, if you know what I mean.”\n\n \n\n “I think she now lives out at Misty Falls Caravan Park. Shame. She was really sweet.”\n \n \n “Who was Tandi?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n Flo looks at you, her trademark smile fading. “Tandi was in the year below me,” she says in a hushed tone. “On the cheerleading squad. Popular, pretty, did well at school. Until one day, she just stopped turning up.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “What happened to her?”\n\n \n\n The waitress glances around, worried about talking in spite of the shop being empty. “No one knows for sure. A few months after I graduated, people started seeing her around town again. Just fleeting. Glances. She doesn’t seem to talk to anyone. And she looks different…”\n\n \n\n Florence pauses, then leans further over the counter towards you. “She’s had some work done, if you know what I mean.”\n\n \n\n “I think she now lives out at Misty Falls Caravan Park. Shame. She was really sweet.”\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n \"Sounds interesting,\" you tell her. \"Do you think I could borrow it?\"\n\n \n\n \"What, now?\" Flo replies, raising an eyebrow. \"I wouldn't have expected you to be interested in a book about business.\"\n\n \n\n You nod. \"If you’re struggling with it, it could give you a break. I'd like to try it.\"\n\n \n\n She thinks for a moment, then shrugs. \"Sure, I was struggling with it anyway.\" She pushes the paperback over to you. \"Maybe you can help me understand it. Just make sure to bring it back after you’re done.\"\n\n \n\n You smile and pick up the book, then thank her.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \"Sounds interesting,\" you tell her. \"Do you think I could borrow it?\"\n\n \n\n \"What, now?\" Flo replies, raising an eyebrow. \n\n \n\n You nod. \"If you’re struggling with it, it could give you a break. I’m a fast reader.\"\n\n \n\n She thinks for a moment, then shrugs. “Sure, I was struggling with it anyway.” She pushes the paperback over to you. “Maybe you can help me understand it. Just make sure to bring it back after you’re done.”\n\n \n\n You smile and pick up the book, then thank her.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \"Sounds interesting,\" you tell her. \"Do you think I could borrow it?\"\n\n \n\n \"What, now?\" Flo replies, raising an eyebrow. \n\n \n\n You nod. \"If you’re struggling with it, it could give you a break. I’m a fast reader.\"\n\n \n \n She smiles politely, but shakes her head. “I think I’ll keep trying. Maybe once I’m done though.”\n\n \n\n You look down at the book. For someone who’s been reading for a year, her progress is small. You imagine you’ll be waiting a long time for her to finish.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n You wait until Florence turns back to the coffee machine behind the counter, then quickly reach out and grab the book. Only then do you realise that you don't have any pockets in your trousers to pocket it away. Why did you forget that?\n\n \n\n Not a moment later, Florence turns and puts your coffee down in front of you. She notices immediately. “Is that my book, ?”\n\n \n You wait until Florence turns back to the coffee machine behind the counter, then quickly reach out and grab the book, jamming it into the back pocket of your jeans. \n\n \n\n Not a moment later, Florence turns and puts your coffee down in front of you. She notices immediately. “Where’s my book?” \n\n \n\n No amount of quick thinking can help you with an answer. You watch her pleasant professional attitude fade quickly. “Did you take my book, ?”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n Feeling yourself blush, you put the paperback back on the counter. “I’m sorry, Flo,” you say. “I don’t know what I was thinking.”\n\n \n\n She nods, but takes the book as soon as you put it down and puts it out of reach. “You could have just waited until I was finished with it,” she tells you. “I won’t be reading it forever.”\n\n \n\n You don’t say a word. She snorts and turns her back to you, wiping down the coffee machine. You decide to leave her alone for now.\n\n \n Feeling yourself blush, you reach back into your jeans and put the paperback back on the counter. “I’m sorry, Flo,” you say. “I don’t know what I was thinking.”\n\n \n\n She nods, but takes the book as soon as you put it down and puts it out of reach. “You could have just waited until I was finished with it,” she tells you. “I won’t be reading it forever.”\n\n \n\n You don’t say a word. She snorts at the inference and turns her back to you, wiping down the coffee machine. You decide to leave her alone for now.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n You shake your head. “No, this is my copy,” you say unconvincingly. \n\n \n\n Flo glares at you. “Don’t lie, . You took my book. Give it back!”\n\n \n\n Determined to hold on to the paperback, you shrug. “I don’t know what to tell you, Flo. This is mine.”\n\n \n\n Flo flares her nostrils and grits her teeth. “You…” she trails off, trying to regain her professional composure. “I think you better leave, .” \n\n \n\n She twirls around and grabs a cloth, scrubbing the coffee machine down with more intensity than could ever be needed to clean it.\n\n \n You shake your head. “I thought you moved it,” you say unconvincingly. \n\n \n\n Flo glares at you. “Don’t lie, . You took my book. Give it back!”\n\n \n\n Determined to hold on to the paperback, you shrug. “I don’t know what to tell you, Flo. I don’t have it.”\n\n \n\n Flo flares her nostrils and grits her teeth. “You…” she trails off, trying to regain her professional composure. “I think you better leave, .” \n\n \n\n She twirls around and grabs a cloth, scrubbing the coffee machine down with more intensity than could ever be needed to clean it.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n Channelling your innate magical abilities, you focus on Florence and feel the stirring of magic in her mind. \"Fall asleep,\" you mutter, “and let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n Florence’s perfectly plucked eyebrows raise ever so slightly before she collapses, hitting the floor with a crash. You rush around the counter and see her sprawled on the ceramic floor. \n\n \n\n You squat down and check her pulse and her head for bruises. Fortunately she seems okay, albeit in a deep sleep. You can’t be sure how much of the morning she’ll remember when she wakes up, but you are certain she won’t remember the last few minutes.\n\n \n\n Gently, you slap her cheek and bring her around. Her eyes flicker open, confused as she sees you beside her. “?” she slurs. “What happened?”\n\n \n\n “It’s okay,” you say quietly. “You just fainted.”\n\n \n\n You help her to her feet. She holds on to you for balance. “I fainted?”\n\n \n\n “You work too much,” you tell her. “Maybe take a day off, okay?”\n\n \n\n She nods, her face the picture of confusion. \"Maybe I should,\" she replies.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n \n You take a breath, focusing the spell carefully as Florence stands across from you, her posture impeccable and her hands folded neatly on the counter. The air around her shifts slightly as the magic takes hold, softening the sharp edges of her demeanor.\n\n \n\n \"It’s interesting,\" she says finally, her tone quieter but no less precise. \"I hadn’t really thought about it until now, but… I find our conversations stimulating.\" Her gaze lifts to meet yours, and though her expression remains composed, there’s a warmth in her eyes that wasn’t there before. \"You ask good questions. Not the kind I'm used to from other customers.\"\n\n \n\n Florence taps a finger against the table, her brow furrowing slightly, as though deep in thought. \"Perhaps I’ve misjudged you,\" she adds after a moment.\n\n \n\n Her words come slower now, each one deliberate, but there’s a softness to her tone that balances her professional banter. As she continues talking, it feels like the space between you has shifted. Like, for once, she’s not just listening to respond, but genuinely hearing you.\n\n \n This has failed, as Florence isn't magic.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You glance over at the teenagers in the booth at the back. “What are they doing here?”\n\n \n\n Florence glances up, a fond half-smile playing on her lips. “They’re here most lunchtimes, Jen. Always huddled in whispers, plotting whatever schemes float through their minds.\" She glances over, wistfully. “It feels like ages since I was that young.”\n\n \n\n You look back briefly, before turning again to Flo. “But why aren’t they in class right now?”\n\n \n\n Florence rolls her eyes. “Oh come on, Jen. You should know better than most. They’re cheerleaders. They come and go as they please. Just like you did.”\n \n <>\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "She chuckles. “I am Gladys. Just an owner of a junk shop. Nothing more than that, I’m afraid.”\n\n \n\n \n “You’re lying,” you reply. “I’ve never seen this place before and my friend lives opposite it.”\n \n \n “You’re lying,” you reply. “I’ve never seen this place before and my girlfriend lives opposite it.”\n\n \n \n\n “Maybe you weren’t looking for it,” she tells you. “It has a funny habit of only attracting those who already know about it. I should really do some marketing, but you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. At least, not whilst they're old.”\n\n \n\n \n \n “I did some research,” you try. “And this shop came up. It said you might be able to help me.”\n\n \n “I was told about you,” you try. “And this shop. They said you might be able to help me.”\n\n \n \n\n Gladys grins. “That I can. But you can help an old lady in asking the right questions. Who I am is incidental. What I can tell you is another matter.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “So. Just to be clear,” you tell Gladys. “Magic is real.”\n\n \n\n She laughs. “Yes, dear. By the fact you are here, you must have experienced enough to know that. But that is not your real question, is it?”\n\n \n\n You give her a look. “How does it work?”\n\n \n\n Gladys smiles. “I haven’t the foggiest. It is something deep-rooted in certain people, attached to their very souls. I have a bit of it attached to me, in spite of what face I am wearing. A condition that I’m sure you can sympathise with, can you not?”\n\n \n\n “It does have its limitations,” she continues. “It can be found in anyone, but only a woman can use it. Men are susceptible to it, can be blessed or cursed by it, can use its charmed trinkets. But only a woman can create. Or a soul in a woman’s body, to be specific. A hunch says that may be important to you.”\n\n \n\n She looks you up and down. “I can teach you, if you like. If that’s why you’re here.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “There’s something strange happening at Charlton School,” you tell her. “I was told you could tell me about it.”\n\n \n\n “And what do you mean by strange?” Gladys replies. “Go on. Don't dilly dally, dear. Say it. Out loud.\"\n\n \n\n “Something magical,” you tell her after a moment. \n\n \n\n She grins. “How curious. All you must have been through and still hesitant to state the obvious. Very well. Yes, that school is cursed. Some evil men have perverted power beyond their means and have enforced their own worldview on its pupils. They control and manipulate them with magic. I’m afraid it has been going on for some time.”\n\n \n\n “Almost as much time as I’ve been waiting for someone powerful enough to challenge them. That is what your amulet was made for.” She offers you a toothy grin. “So it seems we’ve both been surprised of late. But I will not be too quick to judge. Appearances can be deceiving.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You take out the amulet from your pocket and show it to her. “A friend of mine bought this from you. Can you tell me about it?”\n\n \n\n She looks at the amulet, a gleam spreading on her face. She holds her hands over it, as if warming them from its energy. “You’re not exactly what I expected,” she says, staring up at you. “But beggars can’t be choosers.”\n\n \n\n “I blessed that amulet with certain powers,” she continues. “Some of them, I think you have already uncovered. But its intent has perhaps been lost on you. Its only directive was that it should find its way to the person with the magical affinity strong enough to put an end to trouble at Charlton School.\" \n\n \n\n “I did wonder when that girl picked it out from my trinkets if I had blessed it correctly. But now you are in possession of it. Even in my old age, magic still has surprises for me.”\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “The lessons at Charlton. What are they doing to the students?” \n\n \n\n Gladys smiles again. “Why to manipulate, of course. Truth be told, I haven’t been to the school in decades. These days I tend to shy away from those men. But things seldom change in Charlton. That is the way they like it. The way they maintain it. It’s all about power and control.”\n\n \n\n “Are you saying the teachers are responsible?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She chuckles. “Some of them, undoubtedly.”\n\n \n\n “But I thought you said that magic could only be used by women?”\n\n \n\n Gladys gives you an appraising look. “Very good, dear. Maybe the amulet was onto something with you, after all. The headmaster and his minions have old-fashioned views, where women know their place and men rule the roost. In their minds the sun never set on The Empire.”\n\n \n\n She leans over the counter, whispering in spite of no one else being here. “There will be a coven. A group of women, under the guidance of the men. Who they are, I don’t know. They could be the female teachers, other staff, students or even women from the town.”\n\n \n\n “They will be instructed by the teachers to curse objects and equipment, curses that make the students as the teachers think they should be. Subservient. Feminine. Or deviant, depending on their desires.”\n\n \n\n “If there were to be a hero in all of this, they would need to lift the curses on those things. And put a stop to whoever was cursing, once and for all.”\n\n <>\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n “Could you teach me to use magic?” you ask directly.\n\n \n\n She raises an eyebrow. “So, you think of yourself as a saviour? The one who will free the school from the curse that plagues its students?”\n\n \n\n “My sister goes there,” you reply.\n\n \n\n You see Gladys eyeing you carefully. “That explains the amulet’s path to finding you. A selfless hero, ready to sacrifice their own well-being in the service of others. Does that sound like you?”\n\n \n\n You shrug. “I just want to help.”\n\n \n\n “You realise that by walking this path, there will be sacrifices?” she asks. “What you’ve experienced so far is just the tip of the spear. As time passes, the blade will push further and further. Without care, who knows what condition you’ll be left in?”\n\n \n\n She notices your weary look. “So tell me, are you sure you’re willing to do what it takes?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Could you teach me to use magic?” you ask her. \n\n \n\n Gladys cackles. “Forgetful, aren’t you? Magic can only be learned by a woman. I’m afraid that in your condition, you would find the lessons frustrating. There are ways around your impediment, however. I’m sure you are aware of an option or two.”\n\n \n\n Her smile fades. “Come back and see me when you are ready. Then we shall see.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n \n \n \"Will you teach me to remove the curses?\" you ask Gladys.\n\n \n\n “Spells are tricky things,” she replies. “They can not be easily nullified. I can teach you how to perform the curse. It is known as Ward. That should suffice to amend its properties. A curse changed to do nothing is effectively not a curse at all.”\n\n \n\n You nod. “If it helps me stop them.”\n\n \n\n Gladys smiles. “Then we shall begin.”\n\n \n\n She motions you towards the rocking chair and you take a seat. She instructs you to concentrate on your power and the warmth it burns inside your body. \n\n \n\n You close your eyes, letting your breathing slow. Becoming ever-aware of the magical energies churning inside of you.\n\n \n\n “Now,” you hear Gladys say. “Reach out. Look for that sensation outside of your body. In me. In the relics and jewellery scattered on stands. In the shop front and the door.”\n\n \n\n You reach out, as instructed. Immediately, you’re struck by presence. Your eyes may be closed, but you can almost see the room. Dark and unlit, but certain things glowing. Burning with magical energy.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Gladys says. “Pick one of the trinkets. Concentrate on it.”\n\n \n\n You focus your attention on a simple dimpled pint glass that glows brightly in your mind’s eye. It rests on the table near the counter. You can feel the heat from its arcane power. \n\n \n\n “Now. Repeat after me,” Gladys says. “I cause this object with power beyond its power. Unseen and unheard, its effects will be felt by none who use it.”\n\n \n\n You brace yourself, ready to say the words.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You look at Gladys directly. “Can you teach me how to remove the curses?” \n\n \n\n “Alas, my dear, you are missing some essential body parts,” she replies. “Or carrying around an extra one. Come back to me when your body is more suited to the use of magic. I suspect that for you, this will not be hard.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n “Can you teach me how to remove the curses?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “Quite the go-getter,” she says to you, but her words trail off.\n \n \n\n \n She stares at you, harshly. Her eyes looking through you, studying. Then her mouth drops open. “That little minx,” she mutters. “You’ve already learned some magic, haven’t you?”\n\n \n\n You look at Gladys and after a moment, nod. \n\n \n\n The tension is broken as she lightly chuckles. “I can feel it within you. She didn’t do a half-bad job. For a child. Be mindful of her enthusiasm. I was a young upstart once. Rushing too quickly can cause unexpected outcomes. And be prone to the attention of others in our community.”\n\n \n She stares at you, harshly. Her eyes looking through you, studying. Then her mouth rolls up as her lips thin. \"You’ve already learned some magic, haven’t you?”\n\n \n\n You look at Gladys and after a moment, nod. \n\n \n\n The tension hangs in the air, before Gladys sighs. “I can feel it within you. Children teaching children seldom leads to good outcomes. Be mindful of the price people will claim for their tutelage. Secrets in Charlton are seldom given freely.\"\n \n \n \n \n\n “As for you,” she continues. “A basic introduction to your inert power is not required. We may move on to more complex things.”\n\n \n \n “Spells are tricky things,” Gladys says, resolving some authority. “They can not be easily nullified. I can teach you how to perform the curse. It is known as Ward. That should suffice to amend its properties. A curse changed to do nothing is effectively not a curse at all.”\n\n \n\n You nod. “If it helps me stop them.”\n\n \n\n Gladys smiles. “Then we shall begin.”\n\n \n\n She motions you towards the rocking chair and you take a seat. She instructs you to concentrate on your power and the warmth it burns inside your body. \n\n \n\n You close your eyes, letting your breathing slow. Becoming ever-aware of the magical energies churning inside of you.\n\n \n\n “Now,” you hear Gladys say. “Reach out. Look for that sensation outside of your body. In me.

You can feel the heat from its arcane power. \n\n \n\n “Now. Repeat after me,” Gladys says. “I cause this object with power beyond its power. Unseen and unheard, its effects will be felt by none who use it.”\n\n \n\n You brace yourself, ready to say the words.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n “Can you teach me how to remove the curses?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “Quite the go-getter,” she says to you, smiling thinly. “I can, but this is hardly rudimentary, though. Let's start with the basics, first. If you choose to be the hero I’ve been waiting for, you’ll need to understand the fundamentals of magic before moving forward.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n “I think I know who is performing the curses,” you tell Gladys. “When I was removing a curse, one of the cheerleaders came in and started questioning me.”\n\n \n\n “Is she aware of what you are doing?” Gladys asks, concerned.\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “I dealt with it.”\n\n \n\n “Good.” Gladys purses her lips and turns to the bookshelf behind the counter, riffling through volumes. “Be light on your feet with your steps forward. You have only begun your journey into the arcane. Those who conjured these curses should not be so easily overcome. I suspect you have not faced the leader of this group.”\n\n \n\n With a thick thud, Gladys drops a withered hardback book on the counter and opens it to a well-eared page. “See. This is what you will encounter.”\n\n \n\n You glance at the open pages. A picture of a pentagram is spread across the fold of the fading paper, with illustrations of young women at each of its five points. Printed around it are words in a language you don’t understand. \n\n \n\n “Five souls, brought together under the sign of the witch,” Gladys narrates. “Each one a threat, but five together magnifies their power tenfold.”\n\n \n\n She taps her cracked nail on the page. “This is your current adversary. Should they continue to interfere, come to me. We shall accelerate your studies to counter them.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “I had a problem with the last curse I found,” you tell Gladys. \n\n \n\n She looks at you with a serious look. “Oh?” \n\n \n\n “A girl called Reagan. One of the cheerleaders. She knew what I was doing. I tried to make her forget, but I struggled. It almost didn’t work.”\n\n \n\n Gladys gives you a smirk. “Unsurprisingly, there are those behind the curses with magical affinity that matches your own.”\n\n \n\n “She also mentioned the Prom,” you add. “Something about it being too important to be disrupted.” \n\n \n\n Gladys mulls this over. “I fear there is a greater work at play than the gradual effects of simple curses. Continue your investigations. We must learn their secrets if we’re to challenge their plans.”\n\n \n\n You nod. “I think I’m ready to learn more. I think I need to if I’m to continue.”\n\n \n\n “I concur,” Gladys replies. “For your own protection, it is time you learned how to manipulate magic. With this comes a new spell, which will allow you to tamper with the building blocks of the self.”\n\n \n\n Gladys sees you frown. “Memories, my dear. You are nothing if not the collection of your experiences, are you not?”\n\n \n\n “We must move quickly, but thoroughly. This will take some time. Are you ready for the next step in your training?”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n “I’m sure,” you tell her, bracing yourself for the lessons.\n\n \n\n “You seem sure of yourself,” Gladys comments. “Most faced with learning the dark arts have a degree of trepidation about them. But you’re not even nervous.” \n\n \n\n \n She stares at you, harshly. Her eyes looking through you, studying. Then her mouth drops open. “That little minx,” she mutters. “You’ve already learned some magic, haven’t you?”\n\n \n\n You look at Gladys and after a moment, nod. \n\n \n\n The tension is broken as she lightly chuckles. “I can feel it within you. She didn’t do a half-bad job. For a child. Be mindful of her enthusiasm. I was a young upstart once. Rushing too quickly can cause unexpected outcomes. And be prone to the attention of others in our community.”\n\n \n She stares at you, harshly. Her eyes looking through you, studying. Then her mouth rolls up as her lips thin. \"You’ve already learned some magic, haven’t you?”\n\n \n\n You look at Gladys and after a moment, nod. \n\n \n\n The tension hangs in the air, before Gladys sighs. “I can feel it within you. Children teaching children seldom leads to good outcomes. Be mindful of the price people will claim for their tutelage. Secrets in Charlton are seldom given freely.\"\n \n \n \n\n “As for you,” she continues. “A basic introduction to your inert power is not required. We may move on to more complex things.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You nod. “I’m sure.” You watch a smile creep across her lips.\n\n \n\n “Precisely what I wanted to hear. Now. Let’s start with the basics. Plus, as a bonus, a little spell that will make people fall asleep and become ever-so forgetful.” She grins. “Perfect if you wish to do a little moonlighting in their bodies, if you were so inclined.”\n\n \n\n Gladys moves you over to an old rocking chair and motions for you to sit down. “Now,” she says after you’ve sat in the chair. “Relax.”\n\n \n\n You listen to Gladys' words for what seems like hours. She speaks to you softly, hypnotically even. You sense your breath grow shallow and become aware of your heartbeat slowing.\n\n \n\n Then. A feeling. Something inside you, warming your lungs. At first a flicker, then a spark. As you concentrate, the energy grows warmer and consistent. A rush of euphoria, an ever-growing sensation, a connection flowing through your organs.\n\n \n\n “That’s right, dear,” Gladys whispers. “Feel it. Feel its power.”\n\n \n\n You concentrate on the growing pulsing in your body. Now you’re aware of it, it only grows stronger.\n\n \n\n \"Now,\" Gladys continues. \"Repeat after me. 'Fall asleep, and let your memories drift as you slumber.' And,\" she says, almost sardonically, \"think of me.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n\n Gladys nods as you express your hesitance. “You are wise to be hesitant. Curiosity did kill the cat. What is asked from you will lend you great power, but there is a price to be paid.”\n\n \n\n “Take your time to consider if this is a path you wish to tread. But I will tell you that the amulet has waited longer than you can imagine to leave this shop. If you choose to reject it, I fear the school will retain its hold over its pupils for a long time.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You utter the words that Gladys spoke to you. This time, you feel the energies of the glass begin to break apart, like a tablet dissolving in water. \n\n \n\n Except, instead of dissipating, you’re able to channel your mind into another form. As it threatens to become unstable, you find you can form it. Shape it. It’s malleable. \n\n \n\n You focus your mind on the words again. The magic embers you can see floating around the object change as you consider the words. None who use it.\n\n \n\n Then, as quickly as the dark imagery of the room appeared, it fades. You open your eyes and find yourself still in the junk shop. \n\n \n\n Gladys is grinning. She looks back at the cup on the table near the counter. “That glass drained the intelligence of anyone who drank from it. Over the years a number of overly friendly men at McTafey’s have become its prey. Alas, no more.”\n\n \n\n You stare at the glass. It looks the same, but it feels different. You see no aura, nor shimmering energy, but you can feel it. Feel it like other objects in the shop. You can tell just what is blessed with magic, and what isn’t.\n\n \n\n “You feel them, don’t you?” Gladys says. Less of a question, more of a statement. “Good. Now you have all you need to find the source of the curse to the school, and change them for the better.”\n\n \n\n You cast your eye over the shop. Not everything is magic. Though hidden amongst the jewellery and crockery are at least two dozen pieces that give off magical energy. They are almost drowned out, however, by the front of the shop, which radiates power.\n\n \n\n “Easy,” you hear Gladys say. “Perhaps awakening your senses here was an oversight on my part. You will find no other place like this in Charlton. We must hope.”\n\n \n\n You push back the wave of nausea, as your new sense adjusts to the sensory overload. “I feel sleepy.”\n\n \n\n Gladys nods. “Perhaps it is time to call this lesson concluded,” she tells you. “Safe travels home, dear. As always, I will be here when you need me.”\n\n \n\n You look back at the old woman and smile politely. Then make your way back out to the street.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n “I’m ready,” you tell Gladys.\n\n \n\n “Very well,” she replies. She motions you to take a seat. “Let us begin.”\n\n \n\n Sitting down, you close your eyes and concentrate on the energies inside your body. Gladys instructs you to reach out with your mind’s eye, feeling the emanations of the magical objects littered around the shop. You consider now that naturally you feel the ebb and flow of magic through everything, but when you focus the world lights up with a hidden layer, like street lamps coming up at dusk.\n\n \n\n “I have opened up a small window into my own mind,” you hear Gladys tell you. “Just a sliver, but enough for you to feel a sensation. Now. Reach out and tell me what you feel.”\n\n \n\n You turn your focus to where you feel Gladys’ presence. You notice a glowing speck of energy that was hidden from you before. You concentrate on it. \n\n \n\n \"Coco puffs,\" you whisper, incredulously. \n\n \n\n You don’t need to see Gladys to know she is smiling. “One of my small vices,” she says. “This morning’s breakfast. What can I say - the teeth I still retain are sweet ones.\"\n\n \n\n “Concentrate on the memory. The magical orbs that bind that memory together. As you did with the curses, try to pull it apart.”\n\n \n\n You look beyond the memory with your mind’s eye. To the fragments that comprise it. The strands of magic that fuse it together. With a flick of your mental wrist, you feel the bond between its elements weaken.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Gladys whispers. “Now. This level of magic is beyond words. Just think. Alter. And change it.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “I’m ready,” you tell Gladys.\n\n \n\n “I would remind you that you are not,” she says. “Return to me as a woman and we shall further your progress.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \"You are right to be cautious,\" Gladys replies to your hesitancy. \"But a word of advice. You have set in motion events that will blossom in spite of your ongoing efforts. Whether they come back to poison you or you can make fruit from your pruning is down to you. \n\n \n\n “And nature, be it physical or magical, does not pause for indecision.”\n\n \n\n Gladys smiles thinly back at you, but says nothing more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You pull apart the memory with your mind, watching mentally as the kernel of the memory fractures into a thousand pieces. One thing pops into your mind. *Toast*.\n\n \n\n The elements begin to fuse again, the yellow and oranges altering to greens and reds as the memory reforms. Toast, you think. Gladys ate toast.\n\n \n\n The memory package wraps itself back up in front of you. Returning to one solid item, a shimmering nugget in Gladys’ mind that still shimmers with magical energy, but what was once yellow is now blue.\n\n \n\n You open your eyes and look at Gladys. She grins back at you with relish. “A dry breakfast,” she murmurs. “But different to my routine. Congratulations.”\n\n \n\n “You know that I changed your memory though?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “Only because I am conscious of what we were doing. That, and I follow a strict regime. In all things. So I can easily identify if a duplicitous individual has been interfering with my mind. Tell me dear, is there anything that seems different to you?”\n\n \n\n You take a breath and survey your surroundings. Nothing in the shop appears different. \n\n \n\n Then you turn inwardly and immediately sense your own mind. Before a black box, dead to the world of magic. Now you see it as a collection of colourful swirls and energy, open to the universe.\n\n \n\n “Your powers have increased,” Gladys tells you. “You can see the open book others see you as. Such is how inviting the unknowing majority are to the powers of magic. Now that you are aware of it, you can begin to close that door.”\n\n \n\n “Will this prevent the effects of the curses?” you ask.\n\n \n\n Gladys chuckles. “Not quite. There are still those who are far more powerful than you. Including those behind the curses. But this is your next step to overcoming their sway.”\n\n \n\n She helps you stand, as you suddenly find yourself exhausted. “This ends the lesson. Continue your work. When required, we shall complete your education. For now, go home.”\n\n \n\n You smile politely to Gladys and nod, leaving the shop as you mull over how exposed your mind feels to the wider world.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You repeat the words Gladys told you, thinking of the old woman as you do so.\n\n \n\n With a rush of energy, you feel the aura within your body shoot forwards. Your eyes flick open and you see a rush of light hit Gladys square in the chest.\n\n \n\n She stumbles, grabbing hold of the counter to maintain her balance. Her eyes roll and for the briefest of moments you think she’s going to collapse.\n\n \n\n A calm quiet fills the room, the only sound Gladys’ breathing. \n\n \n\n After a moment, she chuckles. “That was impressive. For a moment, I thought I was going to fall.”\n\n \n\n You stand up, reaching over to help her, but she casually hushes you away from her. “I’m alright. Alright dear. No harm. You did well.”\n\n \n\n “Did it not work?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She sniggers. “More than expected. I’m no spring chicken, but I’ve been practising magic for longer than you’ve been having hot dinners. Don’t take it to heart. That I almost succumbed to your spell is most promising. Promising indeed.”\n\n \n\n You nod, and wait for Gladys to stand upright. Once steady, she looks at you. “How do you feel?”\n\n \n\n You spend a moment reflecting. The inner energy swirls inside your body, no longer requiring effort. You can sense its power. \n\n \n\n You grin at Gladys. “I can feel it.”\n\n \n\n She nods. “Good. Good. That is enough for this evening. But come see me again. We have lots to uncover.”\n\n \n\n You nod. Gladys smiles at you, with nothing further to say. Understanding, you walk wordlessly to the door. The bell rings as you open it and you walk outside, feeling your newfound power flowing through your body.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “I need to tell you about something,” you say to Gladys. “I think something is happening to me.”\n\n \n\n The old woman’s eyes narrow, alert to danger. “Oh?”\n\n \n\n “I had a dream,” you tell her. “Except it was vivid. Like it was real.”\n\n \n\n Gladys' eyes linger on you. “Tell me dear, what was this dream about?”\n\n \n\n “I dreamed that I was having coffee with my friend,” you begin. “When we first met. Except, we were interrupted by Dan Mandel. From work. He wouldn’t shut up about men being men.”\n\n “I dreamed that I was back on a date with my girlfriend,” you begin. “When we first started dating. Except, we were interrupted by Dan Mandel. From work. He wouldn’t shut up about men being men.”\n\n \n\n “Was this a dream or a memory?” Gladys asks you.\n\n \n\n You hesitate, then shrug. “I’m not sure. I mean, I remember it. It did happen. Just like in the dream. But...”\n\n \n\n “You have a sense it didn’t happen just like that, don’t you?” she asks, flatly.\n\n \n\n As you nod, Gladys smiles sweetly. “Lesson the first. The amulet changes to your perception of reality. These are not just physical transformations you’re experiencing. Surely you’ve noticed it? That some things come easier for you, some harder, depending on how you perceive the person you’ve become. If your own sense of self-perception is faltering...” She trails off.\n\n \n\n You let this sink in. “But I’m still me. I mean, I still know who I am.”\n\n \n\n “Do you?” she asks. “I remember being a thin young lass dancing around fields with male suitors at my feet. But I know in my heart that’s not who I am anymore.”\n\n \n\n “As we become accustomed to our reality, our self-perception changes. We don’t notice it, but we are forever changing. With the amulet, you are pushing that into overdrive. Recall my advice - you may have to make sacrifices to be the hero we need.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n “What about you?” you ask Gladys. “You have powers. Do you see anything different about me?”\n\n \n\n Gladys chuckles. “You overestimate my power. What you’re describing is unknown to me. The amulet is a powerful artifact that fuses spells together. Stacking magic tends to lead to unexpected consequences.”\n\n \n\n You snort, feeling anger rising. “And you’re telling me this now?”\n\n \n\n “I did warn you,” she replies, cutting you down. “This is not to be trifled with lightly. But if you are indeed experiencing changes without knowing of them, we should act fast. I shall begin my research immediately.”\n\n \n\n “Research?” you stammer. “But what about now?”\n\n \n\n “I would advise you not to use the amulet frivolously,” Gladys responds. “If there is any hint of your own sense of self drifting, additional transformations should be avoided wherever you can.”\n\n \n\n You feel your blood boiling. “But I have to use the amulet!” you exclaim. “How else am I going to put a stop to this?”\n\n \n\n “Use caution,” the old lady says. “Look at me. Do you think that I wouldn’t prefer to be in the form of a young woman, with life ahead of her? There are some consequences to magic that are too great to indulge in idle fantasies.”\n\n \n\n \n \n You take a deep breath, feeling tension throughout your body. Gladys looks at you, curious. Then a flash of frustration.\n\n \n\n \"You've had other dreams, haven't you?\" she says. \"This hasn't been an isolated incident.\"\n\n \n\n You look to her, then shake your head. \"I didn't think it was important.\"\n\n \n\n She sighs deeply, closing her eyes for a moment. When she opens them, you see irritation within them. \"I will prioritise my research. Come see me tomorrow. We shall see what we can do.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, cheeks turning a little red. Gladys sighs again, shaking her head. But says nothing more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You take a deep breath, feeling tension throughout your body. Gladys looks at you, curious. Then a flash of frustration.\n\n \n\n \"You've had other dreams, haven't you?\" she says. \"This hasn't been an isolated incident.\"\n\n \n\n You look to her, then shake your head. \"I didn't think it was important.\"\n\n \n\n She sighs deeply, closing her eyes for a moment.

Gladys sighs again, shaking her head. But says nothing more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Gladys turns away from you, flicking through a nearby book. “Now, unless you have any further questions, I should begin my research.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n “I had another dream,” you begin.\n\n \n\n Gladys looks at you curiously. You can see her mulling over her response. “Go on.”\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath. “It was from my first week at my first job. Back in the city.”\n\n \n\n She nods. “And was it, how you remember it?”\n\n \n\n You reflect on her words before answering. “Yes. Except. There’s a nagging feeling that it wasn’t how it happened at all. But I remember it all the same. Just like in the dream.”\n\n \n\n Gladys looks down at the floor of the shop. When her eyes return to meet your gaze, you can see sadness on her face. She reaches down below the counter and takes out a vial, full of red liquid.\n\n \n\n “I have completed my research,” she tells you. \"What you’re experiencing is a form of the spell, Alter Reality. The amulet is infused with elements of it. Clearly, my calculations were incorrect when I enchanted it.”\n\n \n\n You look between her and the vial in her hand, trying to comprehend her words. “What’s happening to me?”\n\n \n\n “The amulet is reflecting your sense of self,” she replies. “As that changes, it’s shaping reality to suit. What was once straight is now curved. To all who see it.”\n\n \n\n “Your dreams are one way magic is having an effect on you,” she says quietly. “They are your memories, changing and reforming. What you do in your dream is what happened to you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \"How is your research coming along?\" you ask, still feeling a tinge of shame for causing Gladys' rare display of frustration before.\n\n \n \n Gladys looks down at the floor of the shop. When her eyes return to meet your gaze, you can see sadness on her face. She reaches down below the counter and takes out a vial, full of red liquid.\n\n \n\n “I have completed my research,” she tells you. \"What you’re experiencing is a form of the spell, Alter Reality. The amulet is infused with elements of it.

What you do in your dream is what happened to you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n “But… you can change me back, right?” you ask her, hearing the desperation in your voice.\n\n \n\n Again, the sad smile appears. “I have no more knowledge of who you are than you do. To me, you are and always have been the young girl that stands in front of me, asking for help.”\n\n \n\n You consider Gladys' words. In spite of everything that’s happened, that truth burns brightly. Aside from that clawing feeling at the back of your mind, you feel like you are just as you are. How you’ve always been.\n\n \n\n “This,” she says, finally acknowledging the vial. “May help. Then again, it may not. In fact it could complicate matters. Like I said, stacking magic upon magic can lead to unexpected effects.”\n\n \n\n She hands you the vial. You look at it curiously, rolling the liquid around. “What is it?”\n\n \n\n “A potion,” Gladys says, with a trace of satisfaction. “Drink it as yourself before you go to sleep. You will experience a dream unlike any other. Where the energies of magic will piece together the fragments of the past. With any luck, you’ll see who you were.”\n\n \n\n “But it won’t change me?” you ask, still trying to understand what you’ve been given.\n\n \n\n Gladys shakes her head. “No. But it will give you insight into what you’ve lost. With the right mindset and the right choices, you may find that you hold on to some pieces when you awake.”\n\n \n\n Gladys sighs dramatically and moves back around to her counter. “My advice, though, is not to use it. You are adding magic on top of magic. It never ends well.\n\n \n\n “Besides,” she adds, looking you up and down. “I think you’ve turned out quite nicely.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I took that potion you gave me,” you tell her with a hint of embarrassment at your actions.\n\n \n\n She looks at you, her sharp eyes evaluating your mood. “And?”\n\n \n\n You nod, the weight of the dream still clinging to your skin. “I saw… him.”\n\n \n\n Her expression doesn’t change, but you see the slight tightening around her eyes. “Who?”\n\n \n\n Your voice is quieter when you continue. “I saw my old self. He… wasn’t what I expected.”\n\n \n\n Gladys exhales through her nose, slow and measured, as if collecting her patience.\n\n \n\n “I did warn you,” she says. “I told you. Stacking magic on top of magic is dangerous. What did he say?”\n\n \n\n You reflect on the memories of your dream. “That he was the fragments of memories from other people. He seemed disgusted with what - with who - I am.”\n\n \n\n “He was hostile?” she asks quickly. \n\n \n\n When you nod, she moves over to a cupboard and takes out a book. She flicks through the pages and spends some moments reading. “How did it end?” she says as she reads. “As much as you can remember.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You take in a deep breath, feeling the old woman's eyes looking at you in spite of her seemingly reading from the book.\n\n \n\n \n \n \"He said, 'Maybe there's hope for you yet,'\" you reply. “And that he’d be seeing me around.”\n\n \n \"He said, 'If you won't fight for yourself, then I'll have to take matters into our own hands.'\"\n\n \n \n\n Gladys looks up from her book. “The visage you saw was a tapestry of people’s memories of you. In the dark recesses of their mind. Stitched together by magic to form a personality. Unfortunately, those memories that remain buried are the potent ones. Anger. Frustration. Hatred. They aren’t the sum total of your old personality. Fused into one, it seems he’s not as friendly as you might have been.”\n\n \n\n “Was it just a dream?” you ask.\n\n \n\n Gladys looks at you, then shakes her head. “The potion conjured him from other people’s memories and placed him on a magical plane. That’s where you visited. He’s bound there for now, but I fear the potion has weakened the walls between planes. From what you’re telling me, he seems resolute in breaking back into reality.”\n\n \n\n A cold chill settles over you.\n\n \n\n Gladys sighs, rubbing her temple. “Which means, unfortunately, he’ll need a body.” Her gaze settles pointedly on you. “And there’s only one option for him.”\n\n \n\n You swallow hard. “Mine.”\n\n \n\n She nods once. “Yours.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at her, unblinking. The silence hangs in the air.\n\n \n\n “It won’t be easy,” Gladys tries to reassure you. “He’ll need your actions, or inactions, to gain traction. Be mindful of how much you desire to know of your former self. Any avenue to your past will be an opening for him. Heed my words of caution - use magic sparingly. And above all, accept who you are.”\n\n \n\n “What if I want to change back?” you ask.\n\n \n\n \n \n Gladys sighs. There is no more frustration. If anything, she looks… resigned.\n\n \n\n “You've already gone so far,\" she states, leaning forward on the counter, her voice low. “The longer you exist like this, the harder it becomes to trace what was.”\n\n \n\n Your stomach tightens. “So… what are you saying?”\n\n \n\n “I’m saying that any further changes will be irreversible and long-lasting.”\n\n \n\n She doesn’t let the words hang for dramatic effect. She just lets them land.\n\n \n\n You grip the edge of the counter, heart pounding. “You mean, if I use the amulet again, I - ”\n\n \n\n “You may push yourself past the point of no return,” Gladys confirms, her expression grim. “Your reality is on the verge of changing completely.”\n\n \n\n The weight of her words settles deep in your bones.\n\n \n\n Gladys folds her arms. “You need to be more cautious. If you want any chance of stopping your Shadow Self, or even holding onto who you are, then you can’t keep using magic recklessly.”\n\n \n\n Her gaze sharpens, her voice turning serious.\n\n \n\n \"I will continue my research, but again. Heed my words. Next time, there may be no going back.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Gladys sighs. “I will continue my research. In the meantime, come see me immediately if anything further occurs.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n She exhales sharply, setting aside the half-burned candle she’d been working on. “It’s happened again, hasn’t it?”\n\n \n\n You nod, rubbing your arms as if trying to shake off the lingering weight of the dream. “I - something changed. I know it did. But I don’t know what.”\n\n \n\n Gladys doesn’t look surprised. If anything, she looks… resigned.\n\n \n\n “The changes are accelerating,” she states plainly, leaning forward on the counter, her voice low. “I can’t be sure how much - reality is rewriting itself. It’s not just your memories shifting. It’s the memories of everyone around you. The longer you exist like this, the harder it becomes to trace what was.”\n\n \n\n Your stomach tightens. “So… what are you saying?”\n\n \n\n “I’m saying that any further changes will be irreversible and long-lasting.”\n\n \n\n She doesn’t let the words hang for dramatic effect. She just lets them land.\n\n \n\n You grip the edge of the counter, heart pounding. “You mean, if I use the amulet again, I -”\n\n \n\n “You may push yourself past the point of no return,” Gladys confirms, her expression grim. “Your reality is on the verge of changing completely.”\n\n \n\n The weight of her words settles deep in your bones.\n\n \n\n Gladys folds her arms. “You need to be more cautious. If you want any chance of stopping your Shadow Self, or just holding onto who you are, then you can’t keep using magic recklessly.”\n\n \n\n Her gaze sharpens, her voice turning serious.\n\n \n\n “I will continue my research, but again. Heed my words. Next time, there may be no going back.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Without waiting, she speaks. “You seem troubled.”\n\n \n\n You hesitate for a moment before stepping closer. “It’s Emily.”\n\n \n\n That gets her attention. She stops what she’s doing and finally looks up, her sharp eyes scanning your face. “Go on.”\n\n \n\n You take a breath, thinking of the words to describe what you’ve seen. The shifts in Emily’s personality, the way she carries herself now, the flirtation, the way she talks about men and how little she cares about school anymore. How she’s completely stopped questioning Charlton.\n\n \n\n “She’s… different,” you finish. “Not just a little, not like she’s growing up. It’s like the town got to her.”\n\n \n\n Gladys listens without interrupting, her expression unreadable. When you finish, she leans back slightly, crossing her arms. “And what exactly are you asking me?”\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \"You’re a witch,\" you press. \"There has to be something you can do, right?\"\n\n \n\n Gladys lets out a slow, measured breath. “I was hoping you wouldn’t ask me that.”\n\n \n\n She gestures for you to follow her deeper into the shop, where the shelves are stacked high with bottles, powders, and aged tomes. “I’ve seen this before. I know what Charlton does to people.” She picks up a small jar, inspecting its contents before setting it down again. “But magic isn’t the answer here.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “Why not?”\n\n \n\n “Because this isn’t just one curse,” she says firmly. “It’s just not a single spell I can wave away. The magic is woven into many aspects of the school. Adding more magic into the mix without solving the root cause?” She shakes her head. “That’s a gamble I’m not willing to take.”\n\n \n\n You open your mouth to argue, but she cuts you off. “Even if I could snap my fingers and ‘fix’ her, what happens next? She’s still in the school. Still under its influence. Still surrounded by everything that’s shaping her into what Charlton wants.” She gives you a knowing look. “You’d be back here in a week, asking me to do it again.”\n\n \n\n She folds her arms. “The only real way to help her is to stop the source of the problem. You need to deal with the school.”\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \"There has to be something else. Some way to help her.\"\n\n \n\n Gladys lets out a quiet sigh, shaking her head. “I don’t think you understand how deep this runs.”\n\n \n\n She gestures around the shop, at the jars and books that line the walls. “Magic could help. I could give you a potion, a charm - something to slow it down. But it wouldn’t be a cure. It would be like throwing a single drop of water into a raging fire. Charlton is stronger.”\n\n \n\n Her gaze hardens. “If you really want to help Emily, you need to stop the school. That’s where the magic is concentrated. That’s what’s reshaping her. And that’s what you should be focusing on.”\n\n \n\n She turns back to the counter, picking up her vials again. “I know that’s not what you wanted to hear,” she says, softer this time. “But it’s the truth.”\n\n \n\n You stand there for a moment, feeling frustration coil in your stomach. Gladys won’t help.\n\n \n\n If you want to save your sister, you’ll have to deal with the school. *Or find another way.*\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"You look tired,\" she says. \"And desperate.\"\n\n \n\n You manage a weak smile. \"That obvious, huh?\"\n\n \n\n She finally glances up. \"More than usual. What’s on your mind?\"\n\n \n\n \"I was wondering... is there any kind of spell that could help someone be in two places at once?\"\n\n \n\n Gladys narrows her eyes. \"Why would you want to be?\"\n\n \n\n You hesitate, then explain everything. The demotion. The receptionist desk. The growing pile of responsibilities and the slipping grip on your investigation into Charlton Upper. The look on your face is all but begging.\n\n \n\n \"I’m trying to balance everything. Work. The school. I can’t do both. Emily suggested maybe there’s a spell. Something where she could take my place while I keep looking into the school.\"\n\n \n\n Gladys straightens slowly, her expression shifting from curious to cold. \"No,\" she says, flatly.\n\n \n\n The abruptness catches you off guard. \"What? Why not?\"\n\n \n\n The old woman looks down at the shop counter, playing idly with a silver necklace, wrapping it around her fingers. \"What you’re asking is called Alter Form. The ability to transform one thing into another. To change the shape and truth of something. It’s not a parlour trick.\"\n\n \n\n You blink. \"Yes. And isn’t that what the amulet does?\"\n\n \n\n Gladys looks up, clutching the necklace tightly. \"Precisely. And look at what a mess it’s created.”\n\n \n\n A sweet defeated smile spreads across Gladys' face. She loosens her grip on the necklace and tosses it aside. “The amulet was forged in desperation,” she continues. “To protect Charlton. There’s not a day that goes by where I don't question whether creating it was the right thing to do.\"\n\n \n\n \"Magic doesn’t just ‘do’ something and stop,” she adds. “It ripples. One change becomes ten. The world tries to correct what it doesn’t understand, and what you end up with isn’t what you asked for. It’s what reality thinks makes sense.\"\n\n \n\n You start to protest, but she lifts a hand, silencing you with just a look.\n\n \n\n \"No more of this talk,\" she says firmly. \"I will not teach you this. Not for something as trivial as poor time management. Unless there’s an urgent and pressing need, you’re not ready.\"\n\n \n\n She meets your eyes, her stare alone shooting down any protest. You realise that unless you have a better reason, you will not learn this spell from her.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Something has happened to me,” you begin as Gladys looks back at you. “I don’t know what happened. I must have blacked out. And when I woke up, I had this.”\n\n \n\n You lift up your top and turn your back to face her, feeling the pink heart tattoo pulsate with magic like blood flowing through veins. Gladys remains silent, but when you glance over your shoulder you see her eyes are locked on the tattoo, whilst her lips curl up tight.\n\n \n\n “Do you know what it is?” you ask, pulling your top back down.\n\n \n\n Her eyes flicker up quickly to meet yours, watching you carefully. “I do not. Only that its arcane properties are obvious and powerful. Curious though, I did not sense it before you revealed it. Tell me everything that transpired.”\n\n \n\n You breathe through your teeth as you shrug. “I’m not sure. I woke up on my doorstep. Clive found me.”\n\n \n\n “The drunkard masquerading as a philosopher?” Gladys asks, eyes narrowing.\n\n \n\n You nod. “He said that I must have had too much to drink. I don’t remember drinking though. I don’t really remember anything. Especially how I got this.”\n\n \n\n Gladys’ eyes drift back to your hips briefly as she purses her lips. “The drunkard is a red herring. In other times, a night of excess would be justification for lost memories. But around here, at this time? Feels like too much of a coincidence, don’t you think?”\n\n \n\n “Can you remove it?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She sniggers through her nose, skin cracking on her face as she smiles. “Does this look like a tattoo parlour? It may be magic, but the blemish is still ink and pigment. I’m afraid you’ll have to live with it, like any youthful regret.”\n\n \n\n “What does it do, though?” you press. “It’s not just a tattoo. I can feel the magic in it.”\n\n \n\n Gladys’ smile morphs to something akin to admiration. “Now. The right question comes. Alas, I have never seen anything like it before. Its intention is unclear, but it radiates energy without revealing itself. Like I said, I failed to sense it.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes drift back towards your back briefly as her voice lowers. “Like a silent whisper, heard only by those listening for it.” \n\n \n\n She shakes her head and focuses back on you. “Be mindful on where you use magic. Someone, or something, is keeping an eye on you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “I had some trouble with a spell,” you begin. “I tried casting it on the school janitor, but it didn’t work.”\n\n \n\n Gladys’ eyes widen. “You tried a spell at school? Around others?”\n\n \n\n Quickly, you shake your head. “It was in the basement. No one saw.”\n\n \n\n She lets out a small sigh, glancing at the floor briefly until she turns her eyes back to you. “That was a risk.” She holds your gaze for a moment longer before continuing. “How did it fail?”\n\n \n\n “I cast it correctly,” you tell her, trying to ignore her scowl. “But it just didn’t take. Almost as if something was protecting him.” You snort. “It’s lucky he’s not the smartest tool in his box.”\n\n \n\n Gladys looks away as you momentarily lose her to thoughts. “I would deduce that something is protecting him,” she says finally. “Even if he’s not aware of it.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes once again focus on you as her mouth twitches with concern. “Be mindful on using magic in that place. Who knows what wards are watching at school.”\n\n \n\n “You think someone knows?” you quickly ask.\n\n \n\n “I think you should be careful on where you practice the dark arts,” Gladys replies curtly. “You are at the beginning of your journey. There are powers at play that exceed your own.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "“I was thinking about joining a gym,” you tell him. “You’re a member of one, aren’t you?”\n\n \n\n Gordon nods, grabbing a box beside his vehicle. “Casey’s. Off Orchid Road. You should come. Never too late to get in shape.”\n\n \n\n As if demonstrating his own level of fitness, he throws the bulky box into the van. You know you wouldn't be able to lift it.\n\n \n\n \n “Look pretty flexible already. So we can start you with some weights. Then cardio. Soon you’ll be long-distance running. Plenty of clubs run through the fields outside of town. Can do personal sessions, if you like. Like I do for your friend, Jennifer.”\n\n \n\n \"You teach Jennifer privately?\" you ask.\n \n \n “Look pretty flexible already. So we can start you with some weights. Then cardio. Soon you’ll be long-distance running. Plenty of clubs run through the fields outside of town. Can do personal sessions, if you like. Like I do for Chambers. You know her?”\n\n \n\n \"You teach Jennifer Chambers privately?\" you ask.\n\n \n \n\n He nods. “She stops by the gym sometimes,” he replies. “Works next door at the department store.”\n \n \n\n Gordon continues to load his van. You eye him carefully, noticing how he appraises your body without hiding it.\n\n \n\n “Stop by in the evening,” Gordon tells you. “We’ll get you fixed up.”\n\n \n “I was thinking about joining a gym,” you tell him. “You’re a member of one, aren’t you?”\n\n \n\n Gordon nods, grabbing a box beside his vehicle. “Casey’s. Off Orchid Road. You should come. Never too late to get in shape.”\n\n \n\n As if demonstrating his own level of fitness, he throws the bulky box into the van. You suspect you’d struggle to even lift it.\n\n \n\n “We can start you with some weights. Then cardio. Soon you’ll be long-distance running. Plenty of run clubs through the fields that test your calves. Bet your pretty girlfriend will appreciate it.”\n\n \n\n \"How do you know Jennifer?\" you ask, caught off-guard by Gordon mentioning her.\n\n \n\n “She stops by the gym sometimes,” he replies. “To chat. She works next door at the department store, doesn’t she?”\n\n \n\n Gordon continues to load his van. You eye him carefully, but sense no ill-intent coming from him. \n\n \n\n “Stop by in the evening,” Gordon tells you. “We’ll get you fixed up.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n \"Hey Gordon, did you go to Charlton Upper School when you were a kid?\" you ask him.\n\n \n\n He nods, bending to pick up some heavy-looking drill boxes. Without elaborating, he turns to the van and slots them in neatly. \n\n \n\n \"What did you think of it?\"\n\n \n\n \"Waste of time,\" he replies. \"Decent gym. Too much reading.\"\n\n \n\n You pause, wondering whether this is worth pursuing. \"Did you find anything about it… strange?\"\n\n \n\n \"Teachers were weird,\" he says, tying some clunky industrial equipment against the wall of the vehicle. \"Always talking about how guys are superior. And you women should know your place.\"\n\n \n\n \"You don't think that?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n He shakes his head. \"Anyone can be strong. Just like anyone can be weak. Teachers don't like that. Only Coach Beach helped me. Helped me get ripped.\"\n\n \n\n Gordon grins, as he picks up a canister of gas in each arm and puts it into the back of the van without straining. \n \n \n \"Hey Gordon, did you go to Charlton Upper School when you were a kid?\" you ask him.\n\n \n\n He nods, bending to pick up some heavy-looking drill boxes.

Didn’t you?”\n\n \n\n You nod, at least knowing that Jennifer did attend the school. “What did you think of it?”\n\n \n\n “Waste of time,” he tells you, calmly. “Did well at sports. Not in classes. Probably different to you.”\n\n \n\n You give a confused look. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n\n “Used to see you around,” he replies. “Hanging around the town. Popular. Skipping school too. Must have had Stitch's special privileges.” \n\n \n\n You look at him, but sense no deception. *Jennifer was skipping school?* There’s a lot about Jennifer that you don’t know, you realise.\n\n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “You went to Charlton Upper, didn't you?\" you ask Gordon. \n\n \n\n Gordon nods. “I did. Lots of weaklings. Brings the team down.”\n\n \n\n You nod too, trying to remain neutral. “What did you think of it?”\n\n \n\n “Waste of time,” he tells you, calmly. “Did well at sports. Not in classes. Only Coach Beach looked out for me.”\n\n \n\n \"I have him for PE too,\" you reply, considering what Emily might say. \"Any advice?\" you ask him.\n\n \n\n Gordon looks at you for a moment. \"Don't come last. Hard lesson for girls.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “You went to Charlton Upper, didn't you?\" you ask Gordon. \n\n \n\n Gordon nods. “I did. Lots of weaklings.

Only Coach Beach looked out for me.”\n\n \n\n “My sister is struggling with PE,\" you tell him.\n\n \n\n Gordon looks at you for a moment. \"Tell her not to come last. If you had gone there, you would know that girls are taught differently to boys. Hard lessons to learn for girls.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"So Gordon,\" you begin, trying to think of how to question him. \"How does this gym compare to the one at Charlton School?\"\n\n \n\n “Better,” he replies. “No slackers.”\n\n \n\n \"Gyms don't force people to come. Too many weaklings in school PE. Brings the team down.”\n\n \n\n “Did you get on with Coach Beach?” you ask him. \n\n \n\n He nods. “Beach helped me. He looks out for you. If he likes you.”\n\n \n\n “Yeah,” you reply. “My sister said.”\n\n \n\n Gordon looks at you for a moment. “Tell her not to come last,” he tells you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n “Many students from Charlton come here?” you ask Gordon.\n\n \n\n He snorts, a spark of frustration fueling his sudden rush of words. “Yeah. Bunch of momma’s boys. Especially the Mayor’s son. Kid thinks I don’t notice hiding small weights between the big ones. Tries to impress the ladies. He can’t bench for shit.”\n\n \n\n “Do you mean Jake?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n Gordon nods. “All talk and no muscles. Should get his head in gear if he wants to impress the scout that’s staying around.”\n\n \n\n You give him a look. “What scout?”\n\n \n\n “Football one,” he tells you. “Staying at the hotel. Looking for talent. Should have just drove through this town.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Many students from Charlton come here?” you ask Gordon.\n\n \n\n He snorts, a spark of frustration fueling his sudden rush of words. “Yeah. Bunch of momma’s boys. Especially the Mayor’s son. Kid thinks I don’t notice hiding small weights between the big ones. Tries to impress you ladies. Can’t bench for shit.”\n\n \n\n “Do you mean Jake?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n Gordon nods. “All talk and no muscles. Should get his head in gear if he wants to impress the scout that’s staying around.”\n\n \n\n You give him a look. “What scout?” \n\n \n\n “Football one,” he tells you. “Staying at the hotel. Looking for talent. Should have just drove through this town.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Many students from Charlton come here?” you ask Gordon.\n\n \n\n He snorts, a spark of frustration fueling his sudden rush of words. “Yeah.

Looking for talent. Should have just drove through this town.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n “So you mentioned before that Jen comes by here sometimes?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He nods. “Your girlfriend, right? Works next door. She trains here. Working on her core.”\n\n \n\n You stare at him, trying to gauge whether he’s hiding anything. There’s no nervousness about his demeanour. Either he’s a great liar or there’s nothing he’s hiding. Still, you find it strange that Jen hasn’t mentioned to you that she’s started going to the gym.\n\n \n\n “You should follow her lead,” he tells you, bringing you out of your thoughts. “Come back regularly.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You let your brow knit, tilting your head slightly as if trying to puzzle out the screen.\n\n \n\n “Oh… right. Yeah, I always get a bit muddled with this system,” you murmur, letting a small laugh slip through. “I think was the only one who knew how it actually worked.”\n\n \n\n \n \n Gordon snorts. “Phillips?” He raises an eyebrow. \"Didn't seem to do much with a second chance.”\n\n \n\n You wince. \"I think they could sort this out easy.”\n\n \n\n Gordon snorts. \"Not sticking my neck out for that loser again,” he mutters. “See you, Annie.”\n\n \n\n He turns and walks off without waiting for a reply.\n\n \n\n You sit in silence and grimace. It looks like you've burned all your bridges that lead to being rehired.\n \n \n Gordon snorts. “Phillips?” He raises an eyebrow, but his tone softens. “Well. Didn’t break as often when they were here.”\n\n \n\n You nod, eyes wide with manufactured innocence. “Yeah. I dunno. I can barely figure out how to set the out-of-office,” you add, tapping a random key for emphasis.\n\n \n\n He folds his arms, grumbling more to himself than to you. “Computers. Too many buttons.”\n\n \n\n You glance at him, voice still sweet and slightly dazed. “Shame they were let go, really. They could’ve sorted this out easy.”\n\n \n\n Gordon pauses, eyes narrowing just slightly. Thinking. “Might mention that to Thompson,” he mutters. “See you, Annie.”\n\n \n\n He turns and walks off without waiting for a reply.\n\n \n\n You sit in silence, the glittery mouse cold in your hand.\n\n \n\n It was just an act, you remind yourself. But something inside of you seems fuzzy. The words came out easier than they should have. The fluttery tone, the soft confusion.\n\n \n\n You’d meant to act like it was hard to understand, but now you’re not sure how much was performance. How much being in Annie's form is impacting you? If you keep doing this - pretending to be too ditsy to follow - will it stop being pretend?\n\n \n\n Will you even be smart enough to do the job when you get it back?\n\n \n \n \n \n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n\n You hesitate for a beat. Then lower your eyes, letting your voice soften.\n\n \n\n “I dunno,” you mumble, half to yourself. “Just feels like things worked a bit smoother when was still around.”\n\n \n\n \n \n Gordon snorts. “Phillips?” He raises an eyebrow. \"Didn't seem to do much with a second chance.”\n\n \n\n You wince. \"I think they could sort this out easy.”\n\n \n\n Gordon snorts. \"Not sticking my neck out for that loser again,” he mutters. “See you, Annie.”\n\n \n\n He turns and walks off without waiting for a reply.\n\n \n\n You sit in silence and grimace. It looks like you've burned all your bridges that lead to being rehired.\n\n \n Gordon grunts. “They knew their way around the systems, yeah.” He adjusts the strap of his overalls, gaze distant. “Didn’t waste time.”\n\n \n\n You tuck a strand of hair behind your ear. Only just realising the gesture felt instinctive. It's almost comforting.\n\n \n\n “I mean… maybe someone should say something?” you offer, gently. “To Mr. Thompson. Not me or anything. Just… maybe.”\n\n \n\n He gives you a long look. Then nods, just once. “Might do.”\n\n \n\n Without another word, Gordon turns and walks away.\n\n \n\n You exhale. That worked. But there’s a strange heaviness in your chest. It was just a trick, wasn't it? The way you dropped your voice, the way you stepped back, made yourself smaller. It was all just an act.\n\n \n\n Fingers comb a strand of hair behind your ear, again. You realise, just like that, it felt natural. Too natural.\n\n \n\n *If you keep deferring like this... what happens when someone tells you to sit. Will you?*\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n\n You meet Gordon’s eyes for a moment. Then look away. “I’ll see if someone can help,” you say quietly. \n\n \n\n Not really a promise. More of a placeholder.\n\n \n\n Gordon grunts. “Right.” He lingers just a second too long, then turns and walks off.\n\n \n\n The office feels quiet again, but your shoulders stay tense. You could've said something. But you weren't sure how to say it. Maybe you just didn't want to cause a scene. Maybe Annie wouldn’t have said anything either.\n\n \n\n The fact of the matter is, nothing came out.\n\n \n\n You reach for the mouse again, hand still trembling slightly.\n\n \n\n *If you don’t speak up now… will you even remember how?*\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n Before you can stop yourself, your voice turns honeyed, your tone lilting. “Oh, Gordon,” you say with a soft little smile, twirling the phone cord between your fingers. “I’m sure it’s not that broken. Maybe it just needs a gentle touch.”\n\n \n\n The words fall out far too easily. You lean slightly forward in the chair without thinking, posture curved, lashes fluttering just a little too much.\n\n \n\n Gordon stares at you with a stone-faced demeanour. He isn't flustered. But he isn't charmed by your wiles either. He just looks... confused?\n \n\n “What’s that meant to mean?”\n\n \n\n You titter, without meaning to, then wave your hand as if to dismiss the moment. “Nothing! Just trying to lighten the mood, you know?”\n\n \n\n He snorts. “Right.”\n\n \n\n There’s a pause. Then he glances once, vaguely, towards the door that leads through the office and to Thompson. But then he shrugs.\n\n \n\n “Doesn’t matter. I’ll figure it out.”\n\n \n\n And with that, he turns and walks off.\n\n \n\n You sit there, blinking. Your heart races and not just from nerves. You didn’t plan that. Didn’t mean to act like that. It just happened. Worse, it felt easy. Natural.\n\n \n\n *It keeps on happening though, doesn't it?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You offer him a small, playful smile. The type you've seen Annie use before to defuse situations.\n\n \n\n “Well, maybe if you smiled more, Gordon, the system would work properly for you.”\n\n \n\n You say it with a light touch, eyes meeting his just a second longer than necessary. You lean back, letting the chair curve your spine, legs crossed with perfect casualness.\n\n \n\n Gordon blinks. He doesn't blush. Instead, his body goes rigid. “Uh huh,” he mutters.\n\n \n\n A moment of silence passes between you. Eventually he shrugs. “Look, never mind. I’ll fix it myself.”\n\n \n\n He turns without another word, the lines of his shoulders a little tighter than before.\n\n \n\n You exhale slowly. That worked. Kind of.\n\n \n\n But even as you return to the screen, you feel a sinking feeling. You’d used your smile like a weapon. Bent your posture to disarm him. And it worked.\n\n \n\n As much as you try to tell yourself otherwise, you're not sure if you were pretending to be Annie. Or just being her.\n\n \n\n *Or is this just you, now?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You offer him a small, practiced smile. Tilt your head slightly, soften your tone.\n\n \n\n “Maybe if you smiled more, Gordon, the system wouldn’t act up so much.”\n\n \n\n You can feel the tension in the air. They were words that Annie might have said, but you missed the warmth and affection that she almost instinctively injects into banter. Instead, it felt like a slight.\n\n \n\n Gordon stares at you for a beat. Then he frowns. Deeply. “Is that some kind of joke?”\n\n \n\n His voice is flat. You look down at the desk, feeling your cheeks redden.\n\n \n\n “I’ll speak to Thompson. Can’t run this place with people mucking about.”\n\n \n \n He doesn’t wait for a reply. Just turns, strides toward the office door and disappears inside.\n\n \n\n You sit there, frozen. The air feels suddenly thin. Your cheeks burn. Trying not to think about the conversation he must be having with the boss.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You straighten in the chair, keeping your voice even but firm.\n\n \n\n “ is on a job this morning,” you say, meeting Gordon’s eyes. “They’ll fix the booking issue as soon as they’re back. I’ll log it now so it doesn’t slip.”\n\n \n\n It’s a clean, practiced deflection. You offer no space for doubt.\n\n \n\n Gordon squints at you. “Since when do they do field work?”\n\n \n\n You shrug, deliberately casual. “New ideas on understanding customers. Thompson’s orders.”\n\n \n\n A beat. Gordon grumbles something under his breath. But he nods.\n\n \n\n “Fine. Just make sure it gets sorted.”\n\n \n\n He turns and walks off, his boots thudding dully across the carpet.\n\n \n\n You let your breath out slowly. Gordon seemed to accept your point. You're quite sure he won't be going to Thompson.\n\n \n\n What brings you more joy is that you feel, for once, that you didn’t have to smile, giggle, or play helpless to get there.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You sit up straighter, crossing your arms as you lock eyes with Gordon.\n\n \n\n “ is handling something more urgent this morning,” you say flatly. “They’ll fix the system when they’re back.”\n\n \n\n Your tone is sharp. Possibly too sharp. Gordon raises an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n “Urgent? Since when?” he says. “System’s broken now.”\n\n \n\n You try again. “Look, it’s covered. You don’t need to take it to Thompson.”\n\n \n\n Wrong move, amateur.\n\n \n\n “I’ll decide what needs taking to Thompson,” he replies, already turning away. “Not my job to babysit office staff.”\n\n \n \n He marches toward Thompson’s office, muttering to himself. You stay rooted behind the desk, heat rising behind your eyes. It wasn’t the wrong idea, but you just pushed it too hard.\n\n \n\n Maybe in your body, with your voice, it would have landed. But in this form, Annie comes off differently. Snapping. Not leading.\n\n \n\n You grimace, trying not to consider the conversation Gordon is now having with Thompson.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You meet Gordon’s gaze for a moment. Then look away. Your shoulders lift in a faint shrug. Nothing more.\n\n \n\n He waits. One second. Two. Then exhales sharply. “Fine. I’ll go straight to Thompson.”\n\n \n\n You open your mouth, but no words come out. By the time you think of something, he’s already walking off.\n\n \n\n The office is quiet again, but your chest feels tight. You didn’t lie. You didn’t flirt. You didn’t try to spin some story. But you just… did nothing.\n\n \n\n You grimace, trying not to consider the conversation Gordon is now having with Thompson.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n Before you can stop yourself, your voice turns honeyed, your tone lilting. “Oh, Gordon,” you say with a soft little smile, twirling the phone cord between your fingers. “I’m sure has a good excuse. But I'd love to help you with whatever you need.\"\n\n \n\n The words fall out far too easily. You lean slightly forward in the chair without thinking, posture curved, lashes fluttering just a little too much.\n\n \n\n Gordon stares at you with a stone-faced demeanour. He isn't flustered. But he isn't charmed by your wiles either. He just looks... confused?\n \n\n “What’s that meant to mean?”\n\n \n\n You titter, without meaning to, then wave your hand as if to dismiss the moment. “Nothing! Just trying to help out, you know?”\n\n \n\n He snorts. “Right.”\n\n \n\n There’s a pause. Then he glances once, vaguely, towards the door to Thompson's office. But then he shrugs.\n\n \n\n “Doesn’t matter. I’ll figure it out.”\n\n \n\n And with that, he turns and walks off.\n\n \n\n You sit there, blinking. Your heart races and not just from nerves. You didn’t plan that. Didn’t mean to act like that. It just happened. Worse, it felt easy. Natural.\n\n \n\n *It keeps on happening though, doesn't it?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n <> \n \n You offer him a small, playful smile. The type you've seen Annie use before to defuse situations.\n\n \n\n “Well, I'm sure a big strong guy like you can figure out expenses by yourself.”\n\n \n\n You say it with a light touch, eyes meeting his just a second longer than necessary. You lean back, letting the chair curve your spine, legs crossed with perfect casualness.\n\n \n\n Gordon blinks. He doesn't blush. Instead, his body goes rigid. “Uh huh,” he mutters.\n\n \n\n A moment of silence passes between you. Eventually he shrugs. “Look, never mind. If you see Phillips, say I'm looking for them.\"\n\n \n\n He turns without another word, the lines of his shoulders a little tighter than before.\n\n \n\n You exhale slowly. That worked. Kind of.\n\n \n\n But even as you return to the screen, you feel a sinking feeling. You’d used your smile like a weapon. Bent your posture to disarm him.

They were words that Annie might have said, but you missed the warmth and affection that she almost instinctively injects into banter. Instead, it felt like a slight.\n\n \n\n Gordon stares at you for a beat. Then he frowns. Deeply. “That a joke?”\n\n \n\n His voice is flat. You look down at the desk, feeling your cheeks redden.\n\n \n\n “I'm not doing women's work. I’ll speak to Thompson. Can’t run this place with people mucking about.”\n\n \n \n He doesn’t wait for a reply. Just turns, strides toward the office door, pulls it open and disappears inside.\n\n \n\n You sit there, frozen. The air feels suddenly thin. Your cheeks burn.

    "text": "You raise your hand quickly before the lesson begins. Harrow catches sight of you immediately, flashing a gleaming smile. “Yes, Miss Phillips?” he says, voice warm and theatrical. “What could possibly be more compelling than the marvels of natural biology?”\n\n \n\n You hesitate under his gaze. “I’d like to be excused from the lesson.”\n\n \n\n He tilts his head slightly. “Excused?” he repeats, the smile never faltering. “Miss Phillips, surely you’re not suggesting you’d rather skip today’s fascinating dive into the instincts of the natural world? The primal elegance of procreation, the biological imperatives of the female form.” He spreads his arms wide, like a magician revealing a final trick. “There’s so much to admire.”\n\n \n\n You shift in your seat. His words are friendly enough, but something in his tone makes it hard to push back. His charm is thick. Heavy. And somehow oppressive.\n\n \n\n Still, you take a breath. You need to see the boy’s version of the segregated lessons.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You reach into your bag and carefully withdraw the hall pass. Harrow’s smile freezes for a split second. His eyes narrow as he takes in the slip, then flick up to meet yours.\n\n \n\n “Well,” he says, the warmth in his voice not quite masking the suspicion beneath. “It appears you’ve been given permission for other priorities.”\n\n \n\n He steps aside slightly, folding his hands behind his back. “Though I must ask. Are you quite sure, Miss Phillips? Today’s lesson is especially illuminating.”\n\n \n\n You nod, even as something in the pit of your stomach makes you hesitate. A quiet itch to stay and watch.\n\n \n\n Harrow’s smile returns. “Very well. Hurry along then. We wouldn’t want to deprive your other commitments of your… presence.” He gestures toward the door with a graceful wave. “I’ll see you next time.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n You shift slightly in your seat, fidgeting. “I’m sorry, sir,” you say, keeping your voice low. “I think I might need to be excused. It’s… women’s stuff. Cramps. I didn’t want to make a scene.”\n\n \n\n For a moment, Harrow says nothing. He presses his fingers together in front of his lips, gaze flicking over you. Then he sighs with an air of theatrical sympathy.\n\n \n\n “Ah,” he murmurs, keeping his voice to a whisper. “The silent sufferings of the fairer sex. Say no more.”\n\n \n\n He crosses to his desk, opens a drawer, and withdraws a small pad of paper. You watch as he scribbles on it, ignoring the looks of other students now watching you.\n\n \n\n Eventually he returns, sliding a slip onto your desk. \"While I can't claim to know what you're going through,\" he whispers, \"I can at least spare you the miracle of marsupial birth on film for one day.”\n\n \n\n You grimace politely.\n\n \n\n “This will excuse you for this lesson only. I expect you to return next time with renewed spirit and... abdominal stability.”\n\n \n\n You nod, taking the slip. “Thank you, sir.”\n\n \n\n He gestures toward the door, his smile slipping just slightly into a smirk. “Stop by Nurse Rancy’s. She’s frightfully good at treating these delicate matters. You’d be surprised what a little institutional intervention can fix.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You raise your hand quickly before the lesson begins.

Make sure you head straight to her office though, Miss.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

I always come last in PE, anyway. This way, I’ll get extra credit for cleaning. I’ll at least pass.”\n\n \n\n “Where’s Coach Beach now?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She shrugs. “Sometimes he comes,” she says quietly. “Sometimes he doesn’t. He gave me a key to the gym. He lets me come and go as I please. I even clean in the mornings too.”\n\n \n\n “You sound like you enjoy it,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n She looks up at you with her large eyes, a smile appearing in spite of clear reluctance. “You get used to it. The smell. The scents. The boys.”\n\n \n\n You let one of your eyebrows rise up. “The boys?”\n\n \n\n Heather nods, replying in a hushed, if a little resigned, tone. “Beach lets his football players watch sometimes. Comment. Not that I blame them. After all, girls are made for boys.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n “What are you doing waiting here, Heather?” you ask her. \n\n \n\n She looks down to the floor, her cheeks reddening. “Coach Beach said that I might as well clean every evening after classes,\" she mutters. \"I always come last in PE, anyway.

For Beach.” She gulps, her face going sour. “At least he keeps that private.”\n\n \n\n You regard the waifish girl in front of you, considering what her emotionless tone really means. “Isn’t that bullying?”\n\n \n\n Heather shrugs. “Isn’t that how it works around here?” she asks you without care. “That’s how the popular kids keep people in-line. There’s a pecking order to uphold.”\n\n \n\n The words sound foreign to Heather’s voice.

Didn't you?\"\n\n \n\n \"Interesting angles?\" you say, ignoring her question. \"I'm sure others will agree.\"\n\n \n\n \"What do you want?\" Heather stammers.\n\n \n\n \"The key to the gym,\" you reply. \"Then no one will see these.\"\n\n \n\n She glances off to the side and sighs. Then she reaches down and takes out a single key from inside her sock. \"I thought you...\" Her words trail off into silence.\n\n \n\n But she can no longer meet your eyes. She can't look anywhere but the floor.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \"I need that key, Heather,\" you say, hearing the menace in your words. \"It would be in your interests to give it to me.\"\n\n \n\n Heather looks up just slightly. You actually see the paleness of her eyes. She looks exhausted, tired and resigned to this type of treatment.\n\n \n\n \"What do you think you can do that hasn't already been done to me?\"\n\n \n\n You flash her a wicked smile. \"Do you want to test that?\"\n\n \n\n She glances off to the side and sighs. Then she reaches down and takes out a single key from inside her sock. \"Fine,\" she says. \"Just take it.\"\n\n \n\n You smile. \"Thank you, Heather.\"\n\n \n\n Heather looks to the floor, avoiding making eye contact with you.\n \n \n \"I need that key, Heather,\" you say, trying to put menace into Dennis' voice. \"It would be in your interests to give it to me.\"\n\n \n\n Heather looks up just slightly. You actually see the paleness of her eyes. She looks exhausted, tired and resigned to this type of treatment.\n\n \n\n \"What do you think you can do that hasn't already been done to me?\"\n\n \n\n You flash her a wicked smile. \"Do you want to test that?\"\n\n \n\n She glances off to the side and sighs. \"I thought you'd understand, Dennis.\" Her voice is quiet, but flat. She then reaches down and takes out a single key from inside her sock. \"Fine,\" she says. \"Just take it.\"\n\n \n\n You smile. \"Thank you, Heather.\"\n\n \n\n Heather looks to the floor, avoiding making eye contact with you.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \"I need that key, Heather,\" you say, trying to muster some menace in your voice. \"And you're going to give it to me. If, er, you know what's good for you.\"\n\n \n\n Heather looks up just slightly. You actually see the paleness of her eyes. She looks exhausted, tired and resigned to this type of treatment.\n\n \n\n \"I clean the school gym,\" she tells you. \"Most nights. Sometimes with audiences. It's the only way I can pass. People make comments about me. Even my parents now think I'm a lost cause.\"\n\n \n\n She gives you a look with her glistening eyes. \"So tell me, what do you think you can do that I haven't already experienced?\"\n\n \n\n You have nothing to say. She snorts and rolls her eyes. \"Excuse me. I have... somewhere to be.\"\n\n \n\n Without a second glance at you, Heather walks over to the gym door, unlocks it, and slips in. You hear the lock click as soon as the door shuts.\n\n \n \"I need that key, Heather,\" you say, trying to muster some menace in your voice. \"And you're going to give it to me. If, er, you know what's good for you.\"\n\n \n\n Heather looks up just slightly. You actually see the paleness of her eyes. She looks exhausted, tired and resigned to this type of treatment.\n\n \n\n \"I thought you would be different,\" she says flatly. \"But I see now you're just like all the rest.\"\n\n \n\n She gives you a look with her glistening eyes. \"You can't do anything to me, Dennis. Nothing that hasn't been done already.\"\n\n \n\n You have nothing to say. She snorts and rolls her eyes. \"Excuse me. I have... somewhere to be.\"\n\n \n\n Without a second glance at you, Heather walks over to the gym door, unlocks it, and slips in. You hear the lock click as soon as the door shuts.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n \n Heather tries to avoid your gaze, which makes her suspicion of what you plan to do almost nil.\n\n \n\n You look around, noting the quietness and lack of other people. No one to see or hear your wicked whims. Ideal.\n\n \n\n You feel butterflies in your stomach as you mentally stir your magical soup within your body. You take a deep breath, bathing the air inside your lungs in arcane energies.\n\n \n\n And slowly, almost delicately, you let out your breath. The magic infused within the elements highlights the thin trail of air drifting towards Heather's face.\n\n \n\n She sniffs gingerly, almost like a cat to a held out finger. The spell takes hold.\n\n \n\n The meekest of smiles comes to her face. She glances up beneath her eyelashes, looking at you.\n \n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Heather has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Kids messing with the ovens, adding hot sauce to the soup. I’ve seen it all before.\n\n \n\n \"Nurse's orders. Food is as per her instruction. No exceptions.

    "text": "“So, you’ve been here a few years,\" you say, only partially being successful in trying to sound casual. “What do you think about the school?”\n\n \n\n “What do you want me to say?” he replies, dismissively. \"A school's a school.\"\n\n \n\n You nod and choose your next words carefully. “It just seems very old fashioned.”\n\n \n\n “Good,” he snorts. “The more of that, the better. Dad always says that this town is the last haven from hippies and progressives that haven’t ruined this country. I’m glad that someone realises that things are how they are because that’s just the way things are natural.”\n\n \n\n “Have you noticed anything strange going on?” you ask, trying to change tactic.\n\n \n\n “Only that nerd Dennis taking photos of girls,” Jake says. “I’ve even seen him go down to the basement and hang out with that janitor. Probably jacking each other off over his pictures.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I was wondering if you could help me with something,” you say to him. “Why there are some lessons that are only for girls.”\n\n \n\n He snorts. “There’s things that we need to be taught about how to be a man,” he says. “You wouldn’t understand, sweet cheeks.”\n\n \n\n You let the comment slide. *If only he knew.* “I’m serious - what happens in your single sex lessons?”\n\n \n\n “So am I,” he replies. “Men don’t need to know about trivial things like I’m sure they teach you about. You wouldn’t want to be in those lessons. They get rowdy.” He smirks, taking a step further towards you. “Or maybe that’s just the type of thing that turns you on.”\n\n \n\n You feel his panting from his recent workout washing against your neck. You look up at him, feeling small as he leans over. You look at the worn grass, avoiding his eyes.\n\n \n\n He laughs. “You’re such a nerd, Emily. But if you really want to scratch that itch, stop by. You’ll need a hall pass from one of the teachers. Surprised you haven’t got one, already. Thought you only got to the top of the class by having lessons with Stitch. And he gives them out to his favourites like they're sweets.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at him, wondering what he means. He chuckles with derision. “Guess you’re just nerdy, not smart. If you get one, me and the boys will be happy to take care of you.”\n\n \n\n You feel flushed at considering the subtext, but don’t respond.\n\n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You decide to try a subtle approach. “Mr. Beach seems to like you.”\n\n \n\n “Coach is a good man,” Jake says, for once speaking without derision. “He looks after his team. Knows how to get results too.”\n\n \n\n “The football team must train hard to be as fit as they are,” you say to him. \n\n \n\n He smiles arrogantly and flexes his bicep. “You’ve been looking at me, haven’t you Emily? You like?”\n\n \n\n You smile politely. “The cheerleaders must work out too. I wish I could use the gym, so I could train as hard as you do.”\n\n \n\n He snorts. “The cheerleaders are always in that gym. Too often for my liking.”\n\n \n\n You catch him looking at you, his eyes flickering from your legs to your breasts. “There’s a gym near the Evans’ department store. I go there in the mornings at the weekend. Quiet. You should come by sometime. I could show you a good work-out.”\n\n \n\n “I’m not sure I could afford it,” you say, making up an excuse. “Besides, the school gym is free. If only I could get in after school.” \n\n \n\n He looks at you, thinking. “Coach gave me a key. He gives one to all his players. I could give you it, if you did something for me.”\n\n \n\n You give him a look. “Like what?”\n\n \n\n He glances around, seeing if anyone is watching. Once satisfied, he turns back to you. “Meet me under the bleachers after school. If you really want that key, that is.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You look at him, shyly. You know what you have to do, but do you know how?\n\n \n\n *Are you really going to try this?*\n\n \n\n “I was thinking about what you said,” you begin. “Maybe some of it rang true.”\n\n \n\n He grins, his eyes taking in your body. “And what was that?” he asks. \n\n \n\n You take a breath. “About what I want. Telling me what to do.”\n\n \n\n Suddenly interested, Jake takes a step towards you. You can again smell his cheap deodorant mixed in with the sweat of his exercise. “I see,” he says in a hushed voice. “And what if I told you now, to drop to your knees in front of me. In public. Is that something you would do?”\n\n \n\n You glance around the football field, suddenly aware of the other students' presence. Your eyes meet his, as you feel a rush of fear rising up inside your small body.\n\n \n\n Jake suddenly bursts out laughing. “Just like every other girl.” \n\n \n\n You look at the other students. Thankfully no one is paying attention and his laughter soon tapers down.\n\n \n\n “Not here, sweetheart,” he says, the snarl replaced in his voice by lust. “But maybe we can have some fun another time.” \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You shift your weight awkwardly, unsure of where to start. This is a bad idea, you think, but the words are already tumbling out of your mouth. \"Hey, Jake,\" you say, your voice wobbling just enough to make your nerves obvious. \"I was, uh... thinking about what you said earlier.\"\n\n \n\n Jake raises an eyebrow, his smirk widening as he crosses his arms. \"Oh yeah? And what brilliant revelation did you come to?\" he asks, his tone dripping with mockery.\n\n \n\n Your cheeks flush as you try to find the right response. \"Well, um... maybe you had a point about... me needing to loosen up,\" you stammer, the words feeling clumsy and forced. \"You know, about... going after what I want.\"\n\n \n\n Jake stares at you for a moment, his smirk curling into something sharper, crueler. \"Wow,\" he says, leaning in slightly. \"That was... painful to watch. Are you trying to flirt with me, or did you lose a bet?\"\n\n \n\n You feel your face burning as his laugh echoes across the field. \"Relax, nerd,\" he says, his eyes glinting with amusement. \"Not everyone can be good at this stuff. Stick to your comfort zone, yeah? Like reading books.\"\n\n \n\n He takes a step back, still chuckling to himself. \"You gave it a shot, I’ll give you that,\" he says, his tone light but dismissive. \"But I don't think you've got what it takes to satisfy me.\"\n\n \n\n \"Now scram,\" he adds, as his chuckling ceases. \"I'm bored of you.\"\n\n \n\n With no interest in continuing the conversation, Jake turns away from you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You make idle conversation with Jake, as he gets his breath back. Without a topic of conversation he's interested in, you barely get a word back from him.\n\n \n\n Time passes and at a particularly awkward pause in conversation, he tells you he should get back to practicing. He doesn't move. Clearly waiting for you to leave.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You haven't known Jake a long time, but you can take a guess what he expects when a girl meets him under the school bleachers. You feel a stirring within your own body at the thought of it. \n\n \n\n After a brief pause, you nod. He smiles. \"I'll see you there, sweetheart.\"\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You haven't known Jake a long time, but you can take a guess what he expects when a girl meets him under the school bleachers. You feel something inside your body stir at the thought of it, but you quash those feelings down.\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"I don't think that's such a good idea.\"\n\n \n\n He sniggers. \"You'll come around. I'm sure of it,\" he chides.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You haven't known Jake a long time, but you can take a guess what he expects when a girl meets him under the school bleachers. You feel something inside your body stir at the thought of it, but you quash those feelings down.\n\n \n\n “Maybe I can find someone else to help?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He eyes you carefully, then shrugs. “Look, so long as she’s not a minger, you go for your life, sweetheart. But if you get bored trying to find someone, come see me. I’ll make it worth your while.”\n\n \n\n You wonder who exactly would be willing to do the things that you expect Jake wants someone to do. Especially if it risks the wrath of Christina.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You haven't known Jake a long time, but you can take a guess what he expects when a girl meets him under the school bleachers. You feel something inside your body stir at the thought of it, but you quash those feelings down.\n\n \n\n “There must be something else you need?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He laughs. “Not unless you’re pals with the talent scout that’s lingering around.”\n\n \n\n “There’s a talent scout in Charlton?” you ask.\n\n \n\n He nods. “Rumour has it. He’s been to a few practices. Word says he’s representing a top team. Hangs about the pitch in the afternoon, but won't listen to anyone from the school.” He snorts. \"I've tried.\"\n\n \n\n “And if I can put in a good word for you, you’ll give me the key?”\n\n \n\n A gut-wrenching snort comes out of Jake’s mouth. “Oh sure, sweetheart. If you want to try going to his hotel room like a groupie, I’ll give you it. But it would be quicker just to do that to me. I’ll be under the bleachers if you agree.”\n\n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n “I’ve found somebody to help. With your ‘problem’,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n “Don’t think you can handle me yourself?” he smirks. “Who are you setting me up with?”\n\n \n\n “Do you know Michelle Button?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He nods, approvingly. At least, approval mixed with lust. “The ginger? Petite, but with big knockers?”\n\n \n\n You sigh, but nod. “She’s got the hots for you.”\n\n \n\n A devilish smile spreads across his face. “Oh really? Small girl. I could sure throw her around.”\n\n \n\n You grimace, trying not to conjure a mental image of Michelle and Jake. \n\n \n\n “She said she’ll meet you here,” you reply.\n\n \n\n “Sure,” he says, his eyes glinting. “Alright. You’ve got yourself a deal. Shame it’s not you, but she’ll do. Maybe she’ll share stories and you’ll find out what you’re missing out on.”\n\n \n\n He reaches down his football shirt and takes off a chain with a key on the end of it. “This should get you into that gym. Word of advice though, don’t go when the cheerleader squad is in there. They’re real weird about people being around them.”\n\n \n\n You take the key from Jake and nod, politely. He grins, but his attention seems to drift elsewhere. You’ve fulfilled your purpose.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “I had an interesting conversation with the talent scout at the Charlton Hotel,” you say. \n\n \n\n Jake’s attention is suddenly directed only at you. “What?”\n\n \n\n You smile. “I told him that you were the one who held the Charlton team together.”\n\n \n\n He grins, a boyish quality almost coming through his face. “You said that?”\n\n \n\n Nodding, you continue. “He seems interested. I made sure he knew who to look at when he comes to see you play next.”\n\n \n\n Jake looks at you and lets out a deep sigh. “Thanks, nerd,” he says with a degree of affection relative to his usual demeanour. “I didn’t think you’d do that.”\n\n \n\n He reaches down into his football top and pulls out a necklace with a key attached. “This will get you into the school gym,” he says, throwing it to you. “Two things. Don’t get caught up in there with Coach Beach. And avoid it if the cheerleaders are in there. You don’t want to get caught up in that.”\n\n \n\n You give him a look, considering whether to press, but let it go. “Thanks,” you find yourself muttering. \n\n \n\n There is an awkward silence. Jake watches you, almost with puppy dog eyes. You’re not sure whether you preferred his bubbling hostility.\n\n \n\n “Well, I better go,” you say finally.\n\n \n\n He flashes you a playful smirk. “See you around. I hope.”\n\n \n\n You nod, and turn your back to him, shuddering. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “So,” you say to Jake. “You said you would give me the gym key?” \n\n \n\n He sniggers. “Not so fast, nerd. I said I’d give it to you if you did something for me.”\n\n \n\n You bite your lip. “What do you want me to do?”\n\n \n\n Jake grins, sauntering over to stand only inches from you. His athletic build and tall frame dominate your size and body. He looks down at you, his eyes roving across your clothes.\n\n \n\n “Christina hasn’t been kind lately,” he says softly to you. “Too busy with cheerleading. Not looking after my needs.”\n\n \n\n You look up, meeting his eyes. “Like what?”\n\n \n\n He smiles. “I get pent-up after practice. Lots of testosterone and nowhere to use it. I’m backed up.”\n\n \n\n You glance down to his football pants, all traces of doubt on what he wants gone. “How?”\n\n \n\n “Nothing much,” he says, running his fingers across your hair. “I need some release. A handy would do.”\n\n \n\n You feel nervous energy building up in your stomach. “Just that?”\n\n \n\n He nods. “What do you say, nerd? Wanna touch it?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You gulp. “Okay,” you mumble.\n\n \n\n His eyes blaze as a grin spreads on his face. “Knew you were a tramp, Emily. Well, get on with it then. Take it out.”\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath and look downwards at his pants. Are you really doing this? Is there no other way to get into the gym? But you’ve already made your choice.\n\n \n\n Reaching down, you slip a hand underneath the top of his pants. You feel it. A warm, hard shaft, pulsing in response to your touch.\n\n \n\n You pull down his pants a little and free it from its cage. There, gently wrapped in your hand, is Jake’s erect dick.\n\n \n\n “Get on with it, you slut,” he commands. \n\n \n\n You begin to stroke it, tenderly at first. It seems to respond to your movements, warmth radiating through the skin.\n\n \n\n Jake suddenly grabs your hand and brings it up to his mouth. He spits and closes your fingers around it. “Lube,” he tells you.\n\n \n\n You return your hand to pumping his cock, massaging his spit up and down the length. He grabs hold of your chin, forcing you to meet his eyes as you vigorously pump away. “Tell me, nerd,” he spits. “Tell me you want to see me cum.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n “I want to see you cum, Jake,” you repeat back to him. He grins, letting go of your chin, arching his head back.\n\n \n\n You feel his dick twitch and spurts of semen fly up high into the air. You continue to stroke, as more and more cum shoots up. Jake bites his lip to keep himself from moaning.\n\n \n\n Then with a final twitch, Jake’s semen runs down the tip of his dick and covers your hand in his cum.\n\n \n\n You let go off his penis as Jake moves back from you. You look at your hand. The sticky spunk runs down to your wrist. He wasn’t kidding when he said he was backed up.\n\n \n\n Reaching down, you wipe it off on the dusty dirt on the floor. Jake sniggers as he watches you.\n\n \n\n “Not bad, nerd,” he says. “Maybe you can be fun, after all.”\n\n \n\n He reaches into his football shirt and pulls out a chain with a key on it. He throws it next to you on the floor. “That will get you into the gym. Have fun.”\n\n \n\n You pick it up and put it away. Jake pays little more attention to you, so once you’re satisfied your hand is as clean as it can be, you wordlessly leave him alone.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You glare at him, but don’t reply. He sniggers, but releases your chin.\n\n \n\n After a moment more, Jake looks up to the bleachers and bites down into his lip. You hear a muffled moan through his mouth and feel his dick twitch. Spurts of semen fly up high into the air. \n\n \n\n You continue to stroke, as more and more cum shoots up. Then with a final twitch, Jake’s semen runs down the tip of his dick and covers your hand in his cum.\n\n \n\n You let go off his penis as Jake moves back from you. You look at your hand. The sticky spunk runs down to your wrist. He wasn’t kidding when he said he was backed up.\n\n \n\n Reaching down, you wipe it off on the dusty dirt on the floor. Jake sniggers as he watches you.\n\n \n\n “Not bad, nerd,” he says. “Maybe you can be fun, after all.”\n\n \n\n He reaches into his football shirt and pulls out a chain with a key on it. He throws it next to you on the floor. “That will get you into the gym. Have fun.”\n\n \n\n You pick it up and put it away. Jake pays little more attention to you, so once you’re satisfied your hand is as clean as it can be, you wordlessly leave him alone.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n “I’m not going to do that,” you tell Jake, hearing your voice crack as you stand up to him. \n\n \n\n He grits his teeth. “Fine,” he says with a sneer. “Your loss, sweetheart. But you’re not getting that key unless you do something for me. And this is the easiest option for you.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n “Need a hand with that?” you ask him, gesturing to the dumbbells. \n\n \n\n He looks you up and down, then smiles. “The only hand you could provide is one for what’s in my pants.” He laughs at his own joke. “Seriously nerd, do you really think you could help me in any way here?”\n\n \n\n He continues lifting weights. Judging by the amount on each arm, you suspect that he’s right. Still, you press him further. “I’m serious. What’s the matter? Think you’ll get shown up by a girl?”\n\n \n\n He snorts, eyes briefly wandering over your body. “Don’t make bets you can’t cover, love. We both know that you won’t keep up with me. If you’re gunning for a way to see what I’m packing, we can skip the foreplay. Believe me, I know how to give girls what they want.”\n \n \n “You look like you know your way around,” you compliment him. “I was wondering if you’d like to train with me?”\n\n \n\n He eyes you with barely concealed amusement. “I don’t think you’d keep up, sweet cheeks. My set is designed for men. Why don’t you try the ballet class? Better for getting rid of some of that flab on your tush, too.”\n\n \n\n “I’m serious,” you press him. “What’s the matter? Think you’ll get shown up by a girl?”\n\n \n\n He snorts, eyes briefly wandering over your body. “Don’t make bets you can’t cover, love. We both know that you won’t keep up with me. If you’re gunning for a way to see what I’m packing, we can skip the foreplay. Believe me, I know how to give girls what they want.”\n \n \n “You look like you know what you’re doing,” you compliment him. “I need a training partner to keep up the pace.”\n\n \n\n He looks at you and sniggers. “You think you can keep up with me, old man?”\n\n \n\n You feel a little self-conscious, not being much older than him. Evidently, he doesn’t feel the same way.\n\n \n\n “Do yourself a favour,” he continues. “Don’t make bets you can’t cash. I’d bet you couldn’t keep up with me even if you had kept your body in shape as you got older.” His eyes derisively look you up and down. “And from where I’m standing, you definitely have let things slide.”\n\n \n \n\n \n \n Jake seems confident that he could beat you in any workout. You could use this to your advantage to get him to open his locker. If you wanted to deal with working out with him.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n Without a reason to compete with Jake, you decide to not respond to his comments and ignore his taunts for now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n “Care to make things interesting,” you begin. “Put something where your mouth is.”\n\n \n\n \n Jake sniggers. “You are just signing up for a world of pain. Are you sure you don’t want the ballet class? I can hang around. I wouldn’t mind seeing you bend and stretch.”\n\n \n\n From over your shoulder you hear muted feminine laughter from outside. Jake looks over your shoulder briefly, grinning at the girls watching him. But his eyes come back to you.\n\n \n\n “Sounds to me like you’re scared you’ll lose,” you continue, ignoring his leers. “What’s the matter, afraid your admirers would see a girl beating you?”\n\n \n\n A scowl appears on his face and you know the words have landed. “You’re serious, aren’t you?” he says, pausing as he eyes you more carefully. They glance over you, then back. “Alright. What are you offering?\"\n\n \n\n ”What about those dog tags of yours?” you try.\n\n \n\n He snorts. “No chance.”\n\n \n\n You purse your lips. Looks like you’ll need a more indirect way to get inside his locker. “Okay. What about cash. Fifty pounds for the winner.”\n\n \n\n Jake regards you with interest for a long moment, then rolls his eyes. “Easiest money I’ve ever made.\"\n\n \n\n You flash him a smile. \"Can you cover that?\"\n\n \n\n He snorts. \"Don’t you worry. I’ve got enough in my locker. Not that I'll need it. Long before I’m done with you, you’ll be begging to submit.”\n\n \n \n “Go get changed,” he continues. “I’ll be waiting.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n <> \n \n \n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n Jake laughs loudly. “Bet that I can press more than you? Why don't you just give me the money and spare yourself.\"\n\n \n\n From over your shoulder you hear muted feminine laughter from outside. Jake looks over your shoulder briefly, grinning at the girls watching him. \n\n \n\n “Sounds to me like you’re scared you’ll lose,” you continue, trying to regain his attention. “What’s the matter, afraid your admirers would see you beat?”\n\n \n\n A scowl appears on his face and you know the words have landed. “You’re serious, aren’t you?” he says, pausing as he eyes you more carefully. They glance over you, then back. “Alright. What are you offering?\"\n\n \n\n ”What about those dog tags of yours?” you try.\n\n \n\n He snorts. “No chance.\"\n\n \n\n You purse your lips. Looks like you’ll need a more indirect way to get inside his locker. “Okay. What about cash. Fifty pounds for the winner.”\n\n \n \n You grin. \"Can you cover that?\"\n\n \n\n He snorts. \"Don’t you worry. I’ve got enough in my locker. Not that I'll need it. With muscles like those, you’re not even going to finish my set.”\n \n \n\n “Go get changed,” he continues. “I’ll be waiting.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n\n “I can’t get into the locker room,” you tell him. “I’m not a member here.”\n\n \n\n Jake snorts and rolls his eyes. “You think you can best me and you’re not even signed up?” His face is dominated by a sneer. “What am I even wasting my time here for.” \n\n \n\n You stare back at him long enough for him to sigh. “Go,” he gestures towards the counter. “Talk to Casey. Pay some money. Go buy some workout clothes at Evans. Is. That. Clear? Do. I. Need. To Write. This. Down. For. You?”\n\n \n\n Jake chuckles, letting go of his frustration. But it’s clear for the moment, he’s done with you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I can’t,” you tell him. “I don’t have any workout clothes.”\n\n \n\n Jake snorts and rolls his eyes. “You think you can best me and you don't have the gear?” His face is dominated by a sneer. “What am I even wasting my time here for.” \n\n \n\n You stare back at him long enough for him to sigh. “Go,” he gestures towards the door. “Go buy some workout clothes at Evans. Is. That. Clear? Do. I. Need. To Write. This. Down. For. You?”\n\n \n\n Jake chuckles, letting go of his frustration. But it’s clear for the moment, he’s done with you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You stare at Jake. He glares at you. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n You mentally stir the magic within your body and take a deep breath, threading the air in your lungs through the swirling energies.\n\n \n\n Jake’s eyes cloud over as you breathe out, his usual sharp gaze softening into something distant and almost vacant. He blinks slowly, as if trying to push through the haze, but it’s clear the magic has found its mark.\n\n \n\n Then his lips curl into a lopsided smirk as the spell takes hold. The usual sharpness in his eyes is replaced by something softer, though no less calculating. \"Well, look at you,\" he drawls, his voice dripping with a mixture of amusement and something warmer. \"Didn’t realize I was talking to someone so… persuasive.\"\n His gaze stays locked on you, lingering just a beat too long. \"You know,\" he says, his tone teasing, \"Maybe there's something buried beneath that geek. Why don't we find out?\"\n\n \n\n You shift under his gaze, wondering if this was such a good idea. \n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Jake has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n As the charm settles over Jake, his expression shifts from suspicion to something else - lust. He eyes you up and down, his smirk turning razor-sharp. \"You really need that key, do you?\" he says, smirking.\n\n \n\n Reaching into his pocket, he pulls out the gym key, holding it between his fingers like a prize. \"You know, I usually don’t just give things away,\" he says, twirling it lazily. \"But for you? Let’s call it a favour. I'm sure I'll find a way to call it in.\" His grin is all teeth, and there’s a glimmer of desires as he steps closer, dangling the key just out of reach. \"In fact, I can think of a few things already.\"\n\n \n\n Finally, he drops the key into your hand, his fingers brushing yours in a way that feels almost deliberate. \"There you go,\" he murmurs. \"Why don't you spend a while thinking on how to repay me?\"\n\n \n\n You pocket the key, avoiding replying.\n\n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Jake has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You glance at Jake. “I don’t suppose you know how I could get a hall pass? You’re a jock. You must have one.”\n\n \n\n Jake snorts. “Me? Nah. Stitch doesn’t give a damn about football players. Says it builds character, pretends to care about the games. But all he does for us is give us shit if we lose. He’s more interested in cheerleaders, that creepy pervert.”\n\n \n\n \n He sneers at you. “I thought you already got your special perks. Now you’re a cheerleader and all.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n\n “Why don’t you ask Chrissie?” he retorts. “I’m sure she has time for you. Now you’re one of her minions, I'm sure she takes care of you. She always does. With them.”\n\n \n\n He turns away slightly, jaw tight. “It’s amazing what you cheer girls can get if you smile the right way.”\n\n \n He tilts his head, giving you a once-over. “If you really want out of lessons that bad, maybe join the squad. Wear the skirt. Get the perks.”\n\n \n\n “Cheerleaders get hall passes?” you ask.\n\n \n\n He shrugs. “That’s how this place works. Stitch doesn’t care about ‘girls’. But he sure cares about cheerleaders.”\n\n \n\n He offers a cold grin. “If you really want a pass, go speak to Chrissie. That is, if you don’t mind being one of her dolls to play with.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You nod toward the chain peeking out from under his shirt. “Those dog tags. You always wear them?”\n\n \n\n Jake’s eyes flick down for a moment, like he’s forgotten they’re there. “Yeah. What of it?”\n\n \n\n He regards you carefully. You flash him a small smile. \"Just curious. Are they military or something?\"\n\n \n\n That gets a scoff. \"No. From a boxing contest.” He shrugs like it barely registers, but there's a glint in his eye regardless. \"Won one a couple of years back.\"\n\n \n\n \"You won a boxing match?\" you say, trying to inject some admiration into your voice.\n\n \n\n \"Competition,\" he corrects you harshly, though he's grinning with rare enthusiasm. \"Five guys over two weeks. Even had to go through the qualifiers. I didn't get a buy-in, unlike Steve.\"\n\n \n\n \"Who's Steve?\"\n\n \n\n Jake's smile withers. \"My brother. Got an easy run to the final. Didn't help him, that time. Knocked him out in three rounds.\"\n\n \n\n You pause briefly, glancing back at the dog tags. \"So you won them? Must mean a lot to you.\"\n\n \n\n Jake gives a dry laugh. “Didn't get these for winning. Just got a plastic trophy.\" He takes out the tags briefly, flashing them to you. \"I made these myself. Thought they looked better.” He rolls his neck. “More honest, too.”\n\n \n\n He says it like a joke, but his hand drifts toward the chain again, thumb resting just under his collarbone. Then, catching himself, he pulls his hand away and waves it off. “Not a big deal.”\n\n \n\n Despite his words, the dog tags seem particularly important to Jake. If you were looking for a way to attend the boy’s classes at school, you are certain the dog tags could power the amulet. The question is, would you want to go as Jake, how would you get him somewhere to take them from him, and what would he do if lost them?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You study Jake for a moment, as he continues to lecherously stare at you. Even though he won't admit it, you know how much these tags mean to him. Whilst you think you can remove his memories of any tie to you and his tags, he’ll still wake up without them. And when he does, he’ll tear the school apart to find out who took them. You can already picture the fallout.\n \n \n\n But why do you care about that?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You take a deep breath as you come to a resolution. This is necessary, you tell yourself. \n\n \n\n \"Fall asleep, and let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n Jake frowns. “What -”\n\n \n\n His protest snaps off as you feel magic surge out from within you. His body jolts, then slackens. The smirk slides from his lips as his eyes glaze, then close. His weight sags against you for a moment before crumpling down onto the packed earth.\n\n \n\n You kneel, checking. His breathing is steady, deep. His pulse slow and heavy. Out cold.\n\n \n \n In sleep, his face is different. Younger, almost. The hardness gone, the sneer dissolved. Without it, he looks like a boy again, not the swaggering tyrant you've come to know.\n\n \n\n But it won’t last, you acknowledge. When he wakes, he'll still be the same. And he'll be without his precious tags. You wince, trying to bury thoughts of what he'll do.\n\n \n\n Reaching underneath his shirt, you retrieve the dog tags and pocket them. All you need to do now is lure him somewhere private in the morning to transform into him.\n\n \n\n With a final glance at his peaceful sleep, you leave him on the floor.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “What happened to your dog tags?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “What about them?” Jake replies.\n\n \n\n You frown. “You’re not wearing them.”\n\n \n\n Jake doesn’t look up immediately. He finishes the rep, sets the bar down with a controlled clatter, then wipes one palm on his shorts.\n\n \n\n \"Can't wear them in here,\" he tells you. \"Get in the way on the machines.\"\n\n \n\n \"I didn't think you ever parted with them?\" you ask, injecting some humour into your tone.\n\n \n\n \"Only for working out.\" He smirks. \"They come in handy in other places. Serve as a good gag, nerd. I can get them from my locker if you want a taste?\"\n\n \"Only for working out.\" He smirks. \"They come in handy in other places. Serve as a good gag, if you know what I mean. I can get them from my locker if you want a taste?\"\n\n \"Only for working out.\" He spits. \"Not that you'd understand that. Look like this is the first time you've seen the inside of a gym.\"\n\n \n \n\n You reflexively must grimace, as he sniggers at your expense before turning back to the machines. You are certain you can use Jake’s treasured dog tags to transform into him. If you want to steal them from his locker, you’ll need to find a way for him to open it up for you. With no one else around.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n Jake smirks faintly as you pocket the money. “Didn’t think you had it in you,” he mutters, shaking his head. Then his eyes dip, lingering a little too long. “Y’know, there’s other ways I could spend a little money on you.”\n\n \n\n His grin widens, slow and dumb. “Or,\" he continues. \"If you wanted to make it quicker, I can think of some ways you could earn it.”\n\n \n\n You shake your head firmly, unwilling to indulge him. He chuckles at his own joke, unbothered by your rejection, and shuts the locker door with a clang.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n His jaw tightens as he lets go of the cash. “Take it. And scram.” His tone is clipped, the kind of hostile edge that says he’d rather be anywhere else than paying you. The sting of losing to you still lingers, souring the air between you. He jerks his chin toward the showers like a dismissal, eyes hard, every ounce of his posture spelling out annoyance.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You focus your mind’s eye on Jake, willing the magic to take hold. “Fall asleep,” you whisper, voice steady. “And let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n For a second he blinks at you, confusion flashing in his eyes. Then his shoulders sag and he slumps down onto the bench, towel slipping from his grasp. His head lolls back against the lockers, breath evening out almost instantly.\n \n \n \nYou glance toward his locker. The metal door hangs open, and there looped neatly on the inside hook are the dog tags. Heart quickening, you step past him and pluck them free. The chain is cool in your hand. Score. You can now transform into Jake in the mornings at school.\n\n \n\n You pick up the notes from the floor. A faint groan escapes Jake's lips, but his eyes don’t open. The spell has him deep, and when he wakes, this whole exchange will be nothing more than a hazy blur.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You hesitate, but Jake’s grin doesn’t waver. He taps the bench again, expectant.\n\n \n\n Slowly, you lie down on the bench, lowering yourself until your shoulders touch the vinyl. Your head tilts off the far edge, the ceiling lights glaring upside down above you.\n\n \n\n Jake shifts into position, looming at the end of the bench. His shadow falls across your face, shorts brushing close. The angle is all wrong for you. But right for him.\n\n \n\n “That’s it,” he says, voice thick with amusement. “Knew you had it in you. All that effort, just for this.”\n\n \n\n He dangles the wad of notes above you, just out of reach.\n\n \n\n \"Now,\" he says, pulling down his shorts. \"Get to it.\"\n\n \n\n You look backwards, and despite everything being inverted, you recognise the thing that plops out in front of you. Jake's member, thick and already half-erect, inches from your face.\n\n \n\n “Like that, huh?” he murmurs. “Come on. Show me how a receptionist does it.”\n\n “Like that, huh?” he murmurs. “Come on. Show me how a gutter trash failed cheerleader makes her money.”\n \n \n “Like that, huh?” he murmurs. “Come on. Show me if that outfit turns a nerd into a wild girl.”\n \n “Like that, huh?” he murmurs. “Come on. Show me how a submissive little bookworm loves it.”\n\n “Like that, huh?” he murmurs. “Come on. Show me how much of a bimbo is hidden underneath, nerd.”\n\n \n “Like that, huh?” he murmurs. “Come on. Show me if you really are like that outfit makes out.”\n \n “Like that, huh?” he murmurs. “Come on. Show me if you really are as submissive as that collar makes out.”\n\n “Like that, huh?” he murmurs. “Come on. Show me if you really are as much of a bimbo as that outfit makes out.”\n\n \n \n\n You glance up briefly, meeting the eyes of the upside-down Jake. Then, feeling sick, look horizontal to the dick hanging in front of you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You gingerly reach out to take his prick into your hand. It feels warm to the touch, especially in the icy cold air of the locker room.\n\n \n\n \"I'm not paying you to play with it,\" you hear him mutter. \"Open wide.\"\n\n \n\n You do as he says. Without a moment's pause, his own hand wraps around yours and guides his shaft between your lips.\n\n \n\n Your nose erupts with the smell of Jake's sweat, the musk and odour overpowering as his cock enters your mouth. As much as you try to ignore it, there's something intoxicating about it. Together with the warm member filling your cheeks, you find it hard to concentrate. So much so that you feel Jake's hand grasp your chin.\n\n \n\n \"Put some effort in, slut,\" you hear him tell you.\n\n \n\n You begin to bob back and forth. The inverted position makes your movements clumsy. Up is down, and down is up. Jake's tip hits the inside of your cheek, the bottom of your mouth, your teeth. And your vision is just full of pubic hair and glimpses of the floor above you.\n\n \n\n Jake's hand roughly moves your face to allow you to take in more of his meat. He pulls at your jaw, craning your mouth. Then rocks back and forth, guiding his dick to the back of your throat.\n\n \n\n Letting your jaw slacken, you relax as best as you can on the vinyl bench. The tip of his cock slides further and further inside your mouth, touching the back of your throat as you extend your neck. \"Good,\" he purrs, as you fight against your gag reflex.\n\n \n\n You didn't need to do this. You could have used a spell straight away. But here you are, lying on your back, the world turned upside down, letting the school quarterback deepthroat your mouth. And worse is the telling stirring from your own vagina. You can feel yourself growing more wet by the second, as you continue to reflect on the fact that you're willing let Jake use you.\n\n \n\n Is this what you really wanted? Or was the contest just a charade to get a chance to suck some dick?\n\n \n\n You can't answer the question that comes from inside you. Interrupting your thoughts, Jake begins to grow bolder. Rougher, even. He rams his prick in-between your moist lips. Your tonsils strain and you struggle to breathe as a dick stops you from breathing. He holds it in, wrenching your chin to look up - or down - at him. Your eyes start streaming as you are forced to lock his gaze.\n\n \n\n He actually smiles. And then he cums.\n\n \n\n You feel a jet of semen blast down your throat. It takes everything you have not to throw up. Then another burst. And another. Your mouth fills up with cum, salty and warm.\n\n \n\n Finally he pulls back and releases your chin. You gasp for air, just as semen coats your lips and runs from your mouth down to your eyes. They sting as the liquid enters them.\n\n \n\n Jake takes a step back, wiping his dick with his hand and then smearing it on another vinyl bench. You see him throw something out at you, and the notes land on your chest. “Earned every penny,” he drawls. “Guess I was right. Sometimes a girl just needs to know the right angle.”\n\n \n\n Panting for air, you pull yourself upright. The vinyl sticks against your back as you swing your legs down. You wipe your mouth and swallow again. You can feel Jake's cum curdling in your stomach.\n\n \n\n Jake smirks wider, satisfied. “Pleasure doing business.” He shoves the wallet back into his locker, like the transaction is finished. Like you were part of the equipment.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n <>\n\n “I need to talk to you,\" you say quietly to Jake. \"But not here.”\n\n \n\n That gets a snort. He sneers at you, shaking his head. “What, the nerd’s got secrets now? Going to read me your diary?”\n\n \n\n You ignore the jibe, trying to sound steady. “It’s not like that. I just need some privacy. With you.”\n\n \n\n Jake’s expression changes. The irritation slides off, replaced by something hungrier. His smile is crooked now, knowing. “Private, huh? Should’ve said so. Always knew there was a sluttier side to you, bookworm. Guess even nerds have needs.”\n\n \n\n “That’s not what I meant,” you push back.\n\n \n\n “Sure,” he says easily, like he doesn’t believe a word. “Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone. You and me, under the bleachers. Nice and quiet. No one’s going to see a thing.”\n\n \n\n A chill runs down your back. Going underneath the bleachers with Jake might not be the best idea, but he’s right about one thing. It would be private.\n\n \n\n Jake tilts his head, smirk widening as he steps just close enough to test you. “So? What are you waiting for, nerd? I promise you won’t regret it.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n\n You take in a deep breath. \"Alright. Let's go.\"\n\n \n\n Jake's smirk deepens and he hooks a thumb over his shoulder. “Come on, then. Bookworm.”\n\n \n\n You trail him through the gates and into the school. The corridors are busy with voices and footsteps, and more than once you feel eyes catch on you as you follow silently behind him. Some stare outright, some just glance, but all of them see you, studious Emily, following Jake silent. You keep your head down and walk on.\n\n \n\n He doesn’t slow. He strides through the double doors and out onto the football field, leaving the noise of the school muffled behind you. The grass is slick with dew, the bleachers looming empty against the far side. Jake cuts across the pitch without looking back, certain you’ll follow.\n\n \n\n At the edge he ducks suddenly, disappearing into the shadowed gap underneath the seats. For a heartbeat you hesitate, then step after him, drawn into the hush of the space.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n \n <>\n \n <>\n\n **Charlton School - Under Bleachers**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Bleachers.png]\n\n \n\n The wooden struts above creak faintly as a breeze rolls through the field. Dust and the smell of old turf hang in the air. It’s dim here, cut through only by slivers of light between the boards.\n\n \n\n Jake turns on you as soon as you’re both inside. “So,” he says, voice low, lazy. His hand trails over your shoulder. “What was so important you had to drag me out here?”\n\n \n\n His hand quickly drops from your shoulder to your breast. He grips it firmly, causing you to flinch at the touch. \"Was it this?\" he says. To him, it's not really a question.\n\n \n\n Any doubt cast from your mind, you know what he thinks this is. And you know he won't settle for anything less. If you are going to act, you need to do it fast.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You focus your mind’s eye on Jake, willing the magic to take hold. “Fall asleep,” you whisper, voice steady. “And let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n Jake frowns. “What -”\n\n \n\n His protest snaps off as you feel magic surge out from within you. His body jolts, then slackens. The smirk slides from his lips as his eyes glaze, then close. His weight sags against you for a moment before crumpling down onto the packed earth.\n\n \n\n You kneel, checking. His breathing is steady, deep. His pulse slow and heavy. Out cold.\n\n \n \n In sleep, his face is different. Younger, almost. The hardness gone, the sneer dissolved. Without it, he looks like a boy again, not the swaggering tyrant you've come to know.\n\n \n\n \n \n But it won’t last, you acknowledge. When he wakes, he'll still be the same. And he'll be without his precious tags. You wince, trying to bury thoughts of what he'll do.\n\n \n\n Reaching underneath his shirt, you retrieve the dog tags and pocket them. They are cold in your hand.\n \n \n But it won’t last, you acknowledge. When he wakes, he'll still be the same. You reach into your pocket and thumb the dog tags. Reminding yourself of why you're here.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n The next strike cracks across your side. But this time you’re ready. You whip your hand up and catch the towel, knocking it aside before it can bite again.\n\n \n\n Jake’s grin freezes. You plant your palms against his chest and shove. He stumbles back a step, eyes widening.\n\n \n\n The air in the changing room drops into a sudden hush.\n\n \n\n Jake lets the towel fall from his hand. His mouth curls slowly, his voice low and sharp. “So the nerd’s growing balls, huh? Finally giving me something to aim for.”\n\n \n\n He steps forward, shirtless, shoulders squared, his fist drawing back. It swings toward your face, but you slip sideways at the last instant, the air whistling past your cheek. Instinct takes over. You drive your foot into his shin.\n\n \n\n Jake stumbles forward, catching himself just before he goes down. He spins, towering over you now, eyes narrowing. His face hardens. For the first time, he looks like he’s taking you seriously.\n\n \n\n Your pulse hammers. Muscles coil. The surge of testosterone runs hot in your veins, bracing you for the fight that’s coming.\n\n \n\n Then the door creaks open.\n\n \n\n “Alright, alright. What are you boys getting up to?” Beach’s gravelled voice cuts through the tension. The coach lumbers in, his eyes flicking from you to Jake.\n\n \n\n Jake rolls his shoulders, casual again in a heartbeat. “Just giving Mannett a few pointers, coach,” he says easily. “He shows up any team he’s put on.”\n\n \n\n Beach’s gaze moves between the two of you, then down to the towel on the floor. He snorts. “Come on,” he says, raising his voice for the whole room. “Save the horseplay for class. Get to it!”\n\n \n\n The noise returns at once. Boys resume changing, tugging on shorts and trainers, chatter spilling back into the air. Even Jake breaks his glare, turning away as he yanks his shirt from the bench.\n\n \n\n Beach steps closer as you reach for your kit. His mutter is low, meant only for you. “I’d be careful if I was you, Mannett. These boys don’t like being shown up. Especially not in front of the ladies. You make them look bad, don’t expect them to go easy on you later.”\n\n \n\n He gives you a long look, then moves on down the row.\n\n \n\n You finish dressing, pulse still racing, and head out toward the gym.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You hunch low, arms over your head, trying to cover yourself. The towels crack from every side, stinging against your shoulders, your back, your ribs. Wet knots bite into your skin, each one followed by a burst of laughter.\n\n \n\n You curl tighter, scrunched on the bench, but the blows keep coming. Jake barks out jeers, the jocks snap their towels in turn, each strike sharp and merciless. But worse is the sound. The jeering and laughter echoing around the tiled room.\n\n \n\n Another snap, another red stripe across your arm. You bite down hard, forcing yourself not to cry out.\n\n \n\n Then the door opens.\n\n \n\n “Alright, alright. What are you boys getting up to?” Beach’s gravelled voice cuts through the noise. The blows stop at once. The room stills.\n\n \n\n Jake straightens, towel still twisted in his fist. “Just giving Mannett a few pointers, coach,” he says with a smirk. “He shows up any team he’s put on.”\n\n \n\n Beach’s eyes flick from Jake to you. Still hunched on the bench, arms raised, your shirt half off and your skin flushed with red marks.\n\n \n\n For a moment he just looks. Then his gaze shifts to the towel on the floor. He snorts. “Come on,” he says, loud enough for the whole class. “Save the horseplay for class. Get to it!”\n\n \n\n The chatter picks up again. Boys drag on shorts and trainers, laughter subsiding into low murmurs. Jake tosses the towel aside, flashing one last grin at you before turning to dress.\n\n \n\n Beach steps over, offers a hand, and pulls you upright. His mutter is low, just for you. “Careful, Mannett. These boys don’t like being shown up. Especially not in front of the ladies. You make ’em look bad, they won’t go easy on you later.”\n\n \n\n He gives you a long look before moving on, almost one of pity. You tug on your kit in silence, the sting of the towels still burning across your skin. Then you gather yourself and head out toward the gym.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Can you stop cooking for a second?” you ask. “I've got something on my mind.”\n\n \n\n She turns to look at you, then seeing your serious face, puts the knife down. “Okay,” she says. “That sounds ominous.” \n\n \n\n You look at your friend, still smiling as she waits for you to speak. You wonder whether talking to her about any of what’s happening to you is a good idea. You have no idea how she will take it, if she’ll believe you.\n \n \n “Jennifer, can you stop cooking for a second?” you ask. “We need to talk.”\n\n \n\n She turns to look at you, then seeing your serious face, puts the knife down. “Okay,” she says. “That sounds ominous.” \n\n \n\n You look at your girlfriend, still smiling as she waits for you to speak.

And I think you know more than you're letting on. About what went on when you were at school.”\n\n \n\n She sighs, putting a knife down on the kitchen worktop. “Are you accusing me of lying, ?”\n\n \n\n “I thought we were friends, Jen,” you tell her. “That school is strange. Emily’s having a hard time there. And I think you know more than you’re letting on.”\n\n \n\n “Fine,” she says, quietly. “What do you want to know?”\n \n \n “Jennifer,” you say calmly. “I thought we trusted each other.”\n\n \n\n Slowly, your girlfriend looks back at you. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n\n “I mean, you’re not telling me the full truth about what you were like at school.”\n\n \n\n She sighs, putting a knife down on the kitchen worktop. “What does it matter, ? Why do you care what I was like back then?”\n\n \n\n “Because of Emily,” you tell her. “That school is strange, Jen. Emily’s having a hard time there. And I think you know more than you’re letting on.”\n\n \n\n “Fine,” she says, quietly. “What do you want to know?”\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n \n\n \n \n “Emily’s still struggling at school,” you tell Jennifer.\n\n \n\n She nods cautiously. “Did you give her that ring I gave you?”\n\n \n\n \n You nod. “It’s not going to stop the curses though, is it?” Jennifer pauses, then shakes her head.\n\n You offer a noncommittal reply. “It’s not going to stop the curses though, is it?” Jennifer pauses, then shakes her head.\n \n \n\n “The teachers are stern, . But fair. Well, mostly. If she pays attention in lessons and keeps her head down that ring should give her enough protection to get through the year.”\n\n \n\n “What about the other students?” you ask.\n\n \n\n Jennifer grimaces. “I can’t help everybody,” she replies.\n \n \n “Emily’s still struggling at school,” you tell Jennifer. “What do you think about how they teach there?”\n\n \n\n “I imagine it’s very different to the school she used to go to,” Jennifer replies as she continues making dinner. “Very traditional. She should just keep to herself and get through it. It's only another year.\"\n\n \n\n “Did you struggle too?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “Sometimes,” she says, with her back to you. “The teachers are stern. You don’t want to get on their bad side. Stay in their good books, do the lessons, study hard, and don’t rock the boat.”\n\n \n\n She looks over her shoulder at you and offers you a pleasant smile. “Tell her to remember that it’s only another year and then she doesn’t have to listen to them anymore. If she does that, she’ll be okay.”\n\n \n\n You consider her words for a moment. “And if she doesn’t?”\n\n \n\n The smile fades from Jennifer’s face. “She’s a smart girl, . I don’t want to see her get in trouble. It's not like where you went to school. You would be surprised to compare what girls go through at Charlton to where you went to school.”\n \n \n “Emily’s still struggling at school,” you tell Jennifer. “What do you think about how they teach there?”\n\n \n\n “I imagine it’s very different to the school she used to go to,” Jennifer replies as she continues making dinner. “Very traditional.

I don’t want to see her get in trouble. Especially there.”\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n “Emily’s mentioned that some of the lessons at school are segregated,” you tell Jennifer. “That’s strange, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n “It’s not the strangest thing about the school, ,” she replies without humour. “Your mother gave you the talk about the birds and bees, didn't she?”\n\n \n\n You offer her a smile. “I get that. But the subjects are strange. Why separate them for geography?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks at you, weighing up the question. “Why do you think? The curses work differently for boys and girls. It’s all thought through, . They have been doing this for quite some time.”\n \n \n “Emily’s mentioned that some of the lessons at school are segregated,” you tell Jennifer. “That’s strange, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n “There’s some things that are different for men and women, ,” she replies, looking back to you with a wry smile. “Your mother gave you the talk about the birds and bees, didn't she?\"\n\n \n\n You chuckle. “I get that. But the subjects are strange. Why separate them for geography?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer shrugs. “I guess they want students to be free of distractions. Boys will be boys.”\n\n \n\n “Were your classes separated when you went there?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Some,” she says, thoughtfully. “I didn’t think it was strange, though. It’s just how it’s always been at Charlton. Did you just have mixed classes at school?”\n\n \n\n You nod, reflecting on your own school days. “For the most part.”\n\n \n\n “There’s a lot that must seem strange to you, here,” Jennifer says quietly. “One more year though, . Then maybe we can go travelling together?”\n \n \n “Emily’s mentioned that some of the lessons at school are segregated,” you tell Jennifer. “That’s strange, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n “There’s some things that are different for men and women, ,” she replies, looking back to you with a wry smile. “I don’t need to teach you about the birds and bees, do I?”\n\n \n\n You chuckle. “I get that.

Then you can show me how you grew up.” \n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “I hear you’ve been going to the gym?” you ask Jennifer.\n\n \n\n She looks at you and grins. “Yeah. I've signed up. Who told you that?\"\n\n \n\n “Gordon,” you reply. “He mentioned that you’re training with him.”\n\n \n\n She gives you a coy smile. \"Why, are you jealous? He's not so bad looking, for a meathead.\" She giggles. \"I go there sometimes, after work. It’s not just for getting ripped and gaining abs, you know. It’s good for keeping trim and fit. Plus, there's nothing wrong with a bit of flirting. You should sign up too.\"\n\n \n\n \"He's a curious man, though,\" Jennifer continues. \"If you don't take it seriously, he'll give you the cold shoulder. Not like that jock, Jake. Take my advice, don't train with him. Unless you like clumsy teenage hands feeling up your bum.”\n\n \n\n \"Not your type?\" you ask her, with a smile.\n\n \n\n She laughs. \"I'm looking for a keeper. And if I can't find a keeper, I'd prefer a real man to spend time with. I've done my boy phase, and I'm too young to be a cougar.\"\n \n \n \n \n “I hear you’ve been going to the gym?” you ask Jennifer.\n\n \n\n She looks at you, raising an eyebrow. “Oh. Who told you that?”\n\n \n\n “Gordon,” you reply. “He mentioned that you’re training with him.”\n\n \n\n She shrugs. “I go there sometimes, after work. It’s not just for getting ripped and gaining abs, you know. It’s good for keeping trim and fit.” She smirks. “Flexible, too.”\n\n \n\n You give her a look. She looks at you with her large green eyes. “It’s still all about you, . I only want you. If you’ll still have me.”\n\n \n\n She gives you a weak smile.\n \n \n “I hear you’ve been going to the gym?” you ask Jennifer.\n\n \n\n She looks at you, raising an eyebrow. “Oh. Who told you that?”\n\n \n\n “Gordon,” you reply. “He mentioned that you’re training with him.”\n\n \n\n She shrugs. “I go there sometimes, after work. It’s not just for getting ripped and gaining abs, you know. It’s good for keeping trim and fit.” She smirks. “Flexible, too.”\n\n \n\n You give her a look. She giggles and rushes over to you, tickling you gently. “What’s the matter, silly? Jealous that I’m working out with Gordon? You know I only have eyes for you.”\n\n \n\n She gives you a smile. You relax a little. Only when she’s satisfied you’re fine does she turn away.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \"I didn't know that you were a cheerleader at school,\" you say to her.\n\n \n\n She glances back at you, frowning. “How did you find out about that?”\n\n \n\n “Not sure. Just something I overheard,” you say, trying to be casual. \n\n \n\n Jennifer returns to her meal prep, clattering some plates. “It seems easy to just hear a lot of things about me.”\n\n \n\n “I can’t imagine you in that crowd,” you try to move the conversation on.\n\n \n\n “I was a different person back then,” she says quietly. “Didn't you go through a cheerleader phase when you were at school?\"\n\n \n\n You smile. \"It wasn't my thing.\"\n\n \n\n Jennifer raises her eyebrows. \"My point exactly. It's not my sort of thing either, anymore.”\n\n \n \"I didn't know that you were a cheerleader at school,\" you say as she continues to make dinner.\n\n \n\n She glances back at you, frowning. “How did you find out about that?”\n\n \n\n “Not sure. Just something I overheard,” you say, trying to be casual. \n\n \n\n Jennifer returns to her meal prep, clattering some plates. “It seems easy to just hear a lot of things about me.”\n\n \n\n “I can’t imagine you in that crowd,” you try to move the conversation on.\n\n \n\n “I was a different person back then,” she says quietly. “That’s not who I am anymore.”\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “Do you know a girl called Penny?\" you ask Jennifer. \"I think she went to Charlton School when you were there.”\n\n \n\n “Vaguely,” she says, keeping her back to you.\n\n \n\n “She was friends with Annie,” you continue. “She said that you and her didn’t get along.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks over her shoulder, scowling at you. “Penny wasn’t exactly nice to me, either.\" After a moment, she takes a long sigh. \"Her and Annie used to pick on me. For being a cheerleader.”\n\n \n\n You nod, not wanting to risk angering her further. “Did you… spread rumours about her and Annie?”\n\n \n\n Her green eyes stare at you, simmering with anger. You note that she takes a deep breath and exhales before speaking. “School silliness,” she says, dismissing it. \n\n \n\n Jennifer turns her back to you. “I did some things at school I’m not proud of, ,\" she mutters, her voice low and breaking. “I’d prefer not to get into it.”\n \n \n “Do you know a girl called Penny?\" you ask Jennifer. \"I think she went to Charlton School when you were there.”\n\n \n\n “Vaguely,” she says, keeping her back to you. \n\n \n\n “She was friends with Annie,” you continue. “She said that you and her didn’t get along.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks over her shoulder, scowling at you. “Penny wasn’t exactly nice to me, either.

Then she looks back at you. “I did okay.”\n\n \n\n “I was surprised,\" you reply. \"I thought you didn’t like school?”\n\n \n\n “I didn’t,” she says. “Or I didn’t, in the end. I had a complicated time there. Are you the same person now that you were when you went to school? People in Charlton have a hard time moving past how you were. Like Annie Clancy.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer slices on the counter a little too rigorously. You take the hint not to continue with this line of conversation.\n \n \n “I was talking to someone today,” you say, feeling her tension from across the room rise. “They mentioned you were top of your classes at school.”\n\n \n\n “That person wouldn’t be Annie Clancy, now would it?” you hear Jennifer mutter. Then she looks back at you. “I did okay. What of it?”\n\n \n\n “I thought you said you didn’t like school?” you reply. \n\n \n\n “I didn’t,” she says, a little icy. “Or I didn’t, in the end. I had a complicated time there. But it’s nothing that matters now. Regardless of what Annie Clancy thinks. If that’s who ‘someone’ is.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer slices on the counter a little too rigorously. You take the hint not to continue with this line of conversation.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “I was curious,” you begin. “Did you ever do anything risky at school? Like bunk off during the day?”\n\n \n\n She turns to study you, with a small smile. “I might have,” she says, her words suddenly calculated. “Once or twice. Why?”\n\n \n\n You shrug a little. “Oh, nothing. Just something that someone said. That they used to see you with the popular kids skipping school in the afternoons.”\n\n \n\n Her smile wilts slightly. “Charlton must be very different to where you went to school, . If you do well, you get certain privileges. If Emily keeps her head down and works hard, she’ll get them too.”\n\n \n\n You wince at her thinking about Emily’s experience at school, but let it slide. “Who were the kids you used to hang around with?” \n\n \n\n “Just school friends,” she says. “It was all so long ago. Do you still keep in touch with everyone who you were friends with at school? I'm actually really interested to hear about what it's like to live in the city. It must have been so different.”\n\n \n “I was curious,” you begin. “Did you ever do anything risky at school? Like bunk off during the day?”\n\n \n\n She turns to study you, expressionless. “I might have,” she says, her words suddenly calculated. “Once or twice. Why?”\n\n \n\n You shrug a little. “Oh, nothing. Just something that someone said. That they used to see you with the popular kids skipping school in the afternoons.”\n\n \n\n “If you did well at school, you had certain privileges,” she replies. “If Emily keeps her head down and works hard, she’ll get them too.”\n\n \n\n You wince at her mentioning Emily’s name, but let it slide. “Who were the kids you used to hang around with?” \n\n \n\n “Just school friends, ,” she says coldly. “Does it matter? It was all so long ago.”\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “I heard something the other day,\" you begin. \"Sounded like you used to hang out with some of the popular kids. The top of the school pecking order sort-of crowd.”\n\n \n\n “What of it?” Jennifer says without facing you.\n\n \n\n “They don’t sound like they were so nice to some of the other students,” you reply. “You included. That you picked on Annie.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks over her shoulder, giving you a dark look. \"Why are you curious about that, ?”\n\n \n\n You let the tension ease a moment. “Just didn’t seem like you. I was surprised to hear it.”\n\n \n\n “I had a lot of friends,” Jennifer says after a moment. “Some of them weren’t so nice to other people. I think I've mentioned I didn’t like school much. There's some painful memories I’d rather not talk about. Especially Annie.”\n\n \n\n You nod. With a sigh, Jennifer turns back around and resumes her cooking. But not without muttering underneath her breath. “And Annie wasn’t exactly nice to me, either.”\n \n \n “I heard something the other day,\" you begin. \"Sounded like you used to hang out with some of the popular kids.

Jennifer quickly scrambles to pick it up. “What do you mean?”\n\n \n\n “Just wondering,” you say, trying to keep it casual. “You know, hexes, curses, pretending you could cast spells?”\n\n \n\n Jen glances over you just momentarily, then turns back to the counter again. “Did you?” she asks. “Didn’t think you were a black lace and corset kind of girl.”\n\n \n\n You smile, watching her carefully. “That wasn’t my scene.”\n\n \n\n “Mine either,” she replies. “Always thought it was a bunch of superstitious nonsense. You should tell Emily to keep her head out of that stuff, if that’s where this is coming from. This year is too important for her.”\n\n \n\n You let the matter rest, but can’t help but notice she’s keeping her back to you.\n \n \n “Hey Jen,” you say, trying to keep your voice upbeat. “Did you ever have a magic phase at school?”\n\n \n\n A chopping knife falls to the floor.

You should tell Emily to keep her head out of that stuff. This year is too important for her.”\n\n \n\n You let the matter rest, but can’t help but notice she hasn’t once turned around to look at you. \n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “This is going to sound strange,” you begin. “But I’ve been learning about something new recently. About magic.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s eyes narrow. “What?” \n\n \n\n You brace yourself. “What if I told you that magic - spells, books, witches - all of it is real?”\n\n \n\n “I’d think you were joking,” she replies. “Although it’s not really that funny.”\n\n \n\n “I’m serious, Jen,” you say. “I can do things.

She gives you a smile, but it's void of her usual warmth and tenderness. She instead looks tired.\n\n \n\n “I’ll finish the dinner,” she mutters. “Take a seat.”\n\n \n\n You take a seat at the table. As usual, Jennifer has already set out placemats and cutlery in preparation. \n\n \n\n Moments later she puts a plate in front of you, full of meat, vegetables and potatoes. She takes a seat opposite you, but says nothing. \n\n \n\n \"Are you okay?\" you ask her.\n\n \n\n She sighs. \"It's just...\"\n\n \n\n She puts her knife and fork down, then stares at you. \"You know what you sounded like, ? With all that... talk?\"\n\n \n\n \"I know,\" you say quietly. \"It sounds weird.\"\n\n \n\n \"There's a lot of strange people in Charlton,\" Jennifer continues. \"They believe in all sorts of things.

She takes a seat opposite you, but says nothing. \n\n \n\n The pair of you begin to eat, silence only sparsely interrupted to ask for condiments to be passed over. Jennifer seems lost in thought, almost oblivious to you. Time moves slowly as you finish your dinner.\n\n \n\n “Do you want me to stay over tonight?” you ask her. \n\n \n\n She shakes her head. “I need some alone time, I think.” \n\n \n\n You nod and stand up. “Alright.

I’ll be okay.”\n\n \n\n You give her a smile, give her a quick kiss on her lips, and move towards the door.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “What do you know about magic?” you ask her, straight up.\n\n \n\n She lets out a long sigh, as if pushing her resistance out with it. Her body leans against the kitchen counter. When her eyes meet yours, you see they are teary.\n\n \n\n “It’s real,” she says flatly. “I’ve seen it. Practised it. Cast spells and summoned energy that I still can’t believe exists.”\n\n \n\n “Why didn’t you tell me?” you ask her, trying to dampen down the accusatory tone in your voice.\n\n \n\n “Because you wouldn’t have believed me!” she replies. “And then, I didn’t want to encourage you. This is dangerous stuff, ! How do you know about magic, anyway?”\n\n \n \n You hesitate, trying to gauge how much to reveal. “I’ve been investigating,” you say after a moment. “To help find out what’s happening to Emily.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer stares at you. “Magic isn't exactly safe, ,” she says after a long moment. “You have no idea what effect that will have on you. You don’t want to get involved in that stuff.”\n\n \n\n “How did you learn about it?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She gives you a look, her face drained of all warmth. “A coven. At school. A group of girls that cast spells to get their way. I was young. Foolish. It was… stupid. And dangerous. Please, don’t get caught up in it.”\n\n \n\n “I’m being careful,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “I hope so,” she replies. “I'd hate to lose you to this town.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n “What do you know about the cheerleaders?” you ask her. “The ones currently at school. They’re witches, aren’t they?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer sighs, all anger dissipating. “Yes,” she mumbles. “Coven is the preferred term.”\n\n \n\n You look at her, trying to gauge how hard to question her. “How do you know that?”\n\n \n\n She looks off to the side, avoiding your stare. “Because I was one of them,” she says flatly. “When I went to Charlton.”\n\n \n\n You let the silence linger for a moment before responding. “How does it work?”\n\n \n\n She looks back at you, nodding in resignation. “The head cheerleader recruits people to join, mainly because of their affinity to magic. They then teach them how to use it.”\n\n \n\n “Was that why you became a cheerleader?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She shakes her head. “I just wanted to belong.” You notice the tears in her eyes. “The magic came afterwards. A girl called Skye was the head of the squad then. She was in the year above me. She asked me to join, but only then told me the truth.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer takes a deep breath. “But I did enjoy it. For a while.”\n\n \n\n You observe Jennifer carefully. She now refuses to look at you, staring down at the floor with glistening eyes.\n\n \n\n “Then I found out what they were really doing,” she continues. “The curses.”\n\n \n\n She finally looks up at you, a pleading expression on her face. “I was supposed to be the next head cheerleader when Skye graduated. But I couldn’t do it, . So I quit. That’s why Christina was put in charge. She was only a sophomore, but Skye was desperate.”\n\n \n\n “So the cheerleaders create the curses at the school?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She nods. “Please . Believe me when I say I had no idea when I joined them. I might have done some things that I’m not proud of, but I stopped when I realised how much it was hurting people.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n “What do you know about the curses at school?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She nods as you see her thinking, her eyes gazing off and unfocused. “I know they are cast by the cheerleaders,” she says. “Under the direction of the teachers. And the headmaster.”\n\n \n\n “What do they gain from it?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer smiles, sniggering derisively. “Power. Influence. Status. Everything a teenage girl can dream of. The cheerleaders do what they are told and they get free run of the school. Plus, good grades and letters of recommendations for them when they graduate.”\n\n \n\n “How do they do it?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n “Depends on the curse. Some of them are permanent. Others need to be continually cast. Some revolve around an object, others are embedded in the classrooms. It really depends on how strong the caster is.”\n\n \n\n You pause for a second, considering your next question. “Did you cast any curses?”\n\n \n\n She looks at you, her deflated expression evident. She nods. “A few.”\n\n \n\n “Could you remove them?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer shakes her head. “I’m not really that powerful. Certainly not anymore. Be careful, . Christina has been practising for a long time.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n “You bullied Annie, didn’t you?” you say, hearing the malice in your voice. “Like everyone at the top of the school pecking order does.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer arches her back and looks up at the ceiling, sighing. “That’s complicated.”\n\n \n\n You don’t say a word, keeping your gaze locked on her. Eventually, she has to look back at you.\n\n \n\n “Alright, yes. I did,” she says. “Objectively, I was a total bitch. Annie wasn’t exactly the nicest person to me at Charlton. But I didn’t exactly rise to the higher ground.”\n\n \n\n “It’s so unlike you,” you state with disappointment.\n\n \n\n Her eyes tear over. She looks to the floor. “I can’t make excuses for what I did,” she tells you. “Just believe me, . There are ways that people can persuade you to do things. I wanted to belong. And picking on someone who wasn’t exactly nice to me? It wasn’t that much of an ask for an… impressionable girl, who just wanted to fit in.”\n\n \n\n “Who encouraged it?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Skye. The cheerleaders. The teachers.” Her green eyes flick up to you, tears streaming down her face. “I could justify it more, but why bother? I should have been better than that.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n You take a deep breath, knowing what is to come. “Jen. I have to ask. Are you homophobic?”\n\n \n\n Her eyes lock on to yours, momentarily stunned. “No…” Then there’s realisation on her face. “This is about Annie, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n You pause, then shake your head. “Not just Annie. The whole town. What the school teaches. Do you think that girls are made for boys too?”\n\n \n\n She looks to the floor, tears starting to run. “Not anymore,” she whimpers. \n\n \n\n You give her a moment to herself. A long moment later she sniffs, composing herself again. “You have to understand, . This town teaches you things from a young age. A group consensus. I'm sure there's stuff that your grandparents believed that seems abhorrent to you? I was just brought up with no one to tell me otherwise.”\n\n \n\n “Is that an excuse?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Just context,” she replies. “Once I saw what it did to people. That type of prejudice. How it hurt people. I realised.” She sniffs again. “That’s why I want to leave here. Travel. I feel as though I can’t trust my own thoughts and the world will make me see how blinded I’ve been.”\n\n \n\n You look back at her, keeping your tone flat. “What about the rumours you spread? The ones about Penny and Annie.”\n\n \n\n She looks to the floor, but forces herself to look up at you. “If I could take them back, I would. You have to believe me when I say that. And I don’t think highly of Annie, but I regret everyday what I said about her.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n “Your grades,” you state. “Apparently you can’t get to the top of the class without help from Mr. Stitch. Is that true?”\n\n \n\n She looks at you, her pleading eyes narrowing just a fraction. “What do you mean?” \n\n \n\n “I mean,” you continue. “What did you promise Stitch to get your grades so high?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer gazes at you, her green eyes shimmering from emotion and tears. “I didn’t sleep with him, if that's what you're asking.”\n\n \n\n You pause, then shake your head. “We both know there’s more insidious things that he’s involved with.”\n\n \n\n She sighs, glancing up at the ceiling light. When she returns to look at you, she looks tired. Exhausted. “The cheerleaders,” she begins. “The coven. Casting curses. Telling him what was happening at the school. His extra lessons are just a front for swaying you under his control. And the perks of having good grades? The reward.”\n\n \n\n She dangles a foot in front of her, watching it sway. “He promises good grades. A future. A life that could take you away from here.” She looks up to you. “Everything I’d ever wanted. It wasn’t hard to fall into his trap.”\n\n \n\n “But that’s it,” she adds. “And when I stopped. When I left the squad. When I finally did the right thing. All of that fell away.” She gestures to her flat. “And look what I’ve had to settle for.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n “You had special privileges at school, didn’t you?” you ask. “The sort that is only given out to certain students.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer smiles meekly. “It was part of the perks of being a cheerleader. And getting good grades. Stitch rewards those who help his cause.”\n\n \n\n You give her a hard look. “And what did you have to do for his cause?”\n\n \n\n “The same as the rest of them,” she says. “Except, they were already privileged. The rich. The old money. The influential. My family had none of that, . I was just a poor girl living in a small house that everyone made fun of. They didn’t think I would amount to anything.”\n\n \n\n You sigh. \"So you did it for status?\"\n\n \n\n “For acceptance,” she quietly corrects you. “Belonging. It might seem trite to you, but skipping out of school early with the in-crowd was everything I wanted when I felt I didn’t have any friends.”\n\n \n\n “You didn’t answer my question?” you tell her. “What did you do for it?”\n\n \n\n “Nothing that I’m proud of,” she says flatly. “Magic. Rumours. Information. I didn’t realise what I was doing until it was too late.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n \n \n “That’s all I have to ask,” you tell her. “Is that it?”\n\n \n\n She nods, but looks down at the ceramic floor. “I think we’ve pretty much covered it. Magic is real. The cheerleaders are witches. I did some horrible things I’m not proud of.”\n\n \n\n You give her a look. Her eyes look worn and dead from the conversation. “I’ll finish the dinner,” she mutters. “If you still want it.” When you don’t reply, she quietly mutters. “Take a seat.”\n\n \n\n You sit at the table. Jennifer has already set out placemats and cutlery in preparation. Before long she puts a plate in front of you. She takes a seat opposite you, but says nothing.\n\n \n\n The pair of you begin to eat, sitting in silence. You catch her occasionally looking back at you, as if studying you. Time crawls by as you eat.\n\n \n\n “Are you okay?” you ask her.\n\n \n\n She shakes her head. “Not really.”\n\n \n\n \"Want to talk about it?\"\n\n \n\n She looks at you, before sighing. “I just don't want to get caught up in all of this again, . You are the first person to treat me like I'm not ostracised. I know I should have said something, for Emily's sake. But I just wanted to pretend it wasn't happening.”\n\n \n\n “One more thing,” you say. “What made you stop?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer gulps. “They asked me to do something. Something horrible. I realised what I was becoming. I couldn’t stop them. I wasn’t powerful enough. All I could do was walk away.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “What was it?”\n\n \n\n There’s conflict on Jennifer’s face, as if she’s gearing up to speak. But it fades. “I can’t, . Can we save it for another day? This has been painful enough.”\n\n \n\n You pause, but finally nod. \"Just consider it, Jen. Anything you say could help Emily.”\n\n \n\n Jen mulls over what you have said. Then she stands and moves over to a side cabinet. She begins rifling through unopened letters and stationery, finally pulling out a shiny ring.\n\n \n\n “Give this to her,\" she tells you. \"It’s a ring that can diminish the effects of the curses. It’s not much, but it’s all I have left.”\n\n \n \n She hands you the ring. Plain, gold, unassuming.\n\n \n\n “If she wears it,” Jennifer tells you. “The curses won’t have as much impact on her. It should be enough to get her to the end of school. Just let her graduate, don’t interfere, and the two of you can get out of here. Maybe I can tag along, too.”\n\n \n\n You nod, pocketing the ring. “Thank you.”\n\n \n\n “Goodnight,” she says.\n\n \n “That’s all I have to ask,” you tell her. “Is that it?”\n\n \n\n She nods, but looks down at the ceramic floor. “I think we’ve pretty much covered it. Magic is real. The cheerleaders are witches. I did some horrible things I’m not proud of.”\n\n \n\n You give her a look.

But I just wanted to pretend it wasn't happening.”\n\n \n\n “One more thing,” you say. “What made you stop?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer gulps. “They asked me to do something. Something horrible. I realised what I was becoming. I couldn’t stop them. I wasn’t powerful enough. All I could do was walk away.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “What was it?”\n\n \n\n There’s conflict on Jennifer’s face, as if she’s gearing up to speak. But it fades. “I can’t, . Can we save it for another day? This has been painful enough.”\n\n \n\n You pause, but finally nod. \"Just consider it, Jen. Anything you say could help Emily.”\n\n \n\n Jen mulls over what you have said. Then she stands and moves over to a side cabinet. She begins rifling through unopened letters and stationery, finally pulling out a shiny ring.\n\n \n\n “Give this to her,\" she tells you. \"It’s a ring that can diminish the effects of the curses. It’s not much, but it’s all I have left.”\n\n \n\n She hands you the ring. Plain, gold, unassuming.\n\n \n\n “If she wears it,” Jennifer tells you. “The curses won’t have as much impact on her. It should be enough to get her to the end of school. Just let her graduate, don’t interfere, and we can all leave Charlton together.”\n\n \n \n You nod, pocketing the ring. “Thank you.”\n\n \n\n She looks up at you, eyes tearing again. “I guess you’re not staying tonight?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “I need to process all this, Jen.”\n\n \n\n She nods. Offers you a weak smile. “If you want to talk about anything. Anything at all. You know where to find me. Even in the mornings, before I go to work.”\n\n \n\n “I will,” you reply.\n\n \n\n “Goodnight,” she says. Eyes hopeful.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n You take a seat at the table. As usual, Jennifer has already set out placemats and cutlery in preparation for the meal.\n\n \n\n Moments later she puts a steaming plate down in front of you, full of succulent meat, steamed vegetables and buttered new potatoes covered in chives. She then sits down opposite you with a similar meal.\n\n \n\n “It's not some of my best,” she says to you. “I’ve tried a new seasoning on the meat. Charli at the supermarket recommended it. Just came in. Has a bit of a kick to it. I'm not sold on it though. What do you think?”\n\n \n\n You take a bite. As with all of Jennifer’s meals, it tastes delicious.\n\n \n\n You compliment her cooking and she dismisses it with a wave of her hand. You eat quickly, relishing the quality of the home cooked meal. Jennifer begins chatting as she eats, carefree and clearly happy that you are enjoying the food.\n\n \n\n \n \n Throughout, you try to make small talk with Jennifer. She tries, but struggles with the conversation. Her mind seems to drift. At times, she can’t even meet your gaze. When you steer the topic to her favourite topic of travel, she seems deflated at the idea.\n\n \n\n Time ticks by slowly. By the end of the meal, there have been stretches of silence. \n\n \n\n \"This has been fun,\" she says, unconvincingly. \"Thanks for coming over, .\"\n \n\n You smile. \"I should get going.\"\n\n \n\n \"Stop by, anytime,\" she tells you. \"Not just for dinner. I don’t go to work until late in the mornings. If you fancy a natter before you start work, I can trade some eggs for a chat.\"\n\n \n\n She looks hopeful. As if she’s pinning a lot on it.\n\n \n Throughout the meal, you make small talk with Jennifer. She asks about your Thompson's and how you're finding working in an office of all guys. It's clear she's fishing for gossip, but she doesn't pry when you are noncommittal. In turn, she tells you all about the drama at Evans' department store, including some entitled customers, who sound just as sleazy as the ones at your work.\n\n \n\n The conversation turns to her lamenting over Charlton and her half-baked plans to travel or move away to another town. Despite an obvious desire to do something else with her life, she seems to lack detail. You feel these are idle fantasies at best.\n\n \n \n You continue talking long after you both have finished your meals, each making jokes about work and the inhabitants of the town. Before long, you realise time has ticked away.\n\n \n\n \"This has been fun,\" she tells you. \"Thanks for coming over, .\"\n\n \n\n You smile. \"I should get going.\"\n\n \n\n \"Stop by, anytime,\" she tells you. \"Not just for dinner. I don’t go to work until late in the mornings. If you fancy a natter before you start work, I can trade some eggs for a chat.\"\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You take a seat at the table.

She then sits down opposite you with a similar - if smaller - meal.\n\n \n\n “I hope you like it,” she says to you. “I’ve tried a new seasoning on the meat. Charli at the supermarket recommended it. Just came in. Has a bit of a kick to it.”\n\n \n\n You take a bite. As with all of Jennifer’s meals, it tastes delicious. \n\n \n\n \n \n You compliment her cooking, but she only smiles faintly back. You eat quickly, relishing the quality of the home cooked meal. Jennifer eats more slowly, but watches you ravish the dinner, keeping silent.\n\n \n\n Throughout, you try to make small talk with Jennifer. She tries, but struggles with the conversation.

By the end of the meal, there have been stretches of silence. \n\n \n\n You smile. \"I should get going.\"\n\n \n\n \n \n She smiles sweetly. “I guess you should really get back. With Emily and everything that’s happening.”\n\n \n\n You frown, curious. “You don’t want me to stay over?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer lets out a small smirk. “I’d love to. But Emily should come first. Besides, I’ve got to take care of a few things in the morning.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow, but she giggles. “Personal things. Goodnight, .”\n\n \n\n But she smirks as she opens the door for you. A gleam in her eye you haven’t seen… since the confrontation.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n There’s a small spark in her eye. “Or… why don’t you stay over? I’m sure Emily can take care of herself for the evening.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n You compliment her cooking and she beams. You eat quickly, relishing the quality of the home cooked meal. Jennifer eats more slowly, but watches you ravish the dinner, happily smiling at your clear enjoyment.\n\n \n\n Throughout the meal, you make small talk with Jennifer, listening attentively as she tells you all about her day. Her thoughts often drift to future plans, whether it’s her latest thoughts on where you could go during your planned travels, or up and coming towns away from Charlton that she’s heard are nice places to settle down.\n\n \n\n You continue talking long after you both have finished your meals, each making jokes about work and the inhabitants of the town. Before long, you realise time has ticked away.\n \n \n\n You smile. \"I should get going.\"\n \n \n\n There’s a glint in her eye. “Or… why don’t you stay over? I’m sure Emily can take care of herself for the evening.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n \n You grimace, apologetic. “I should really get back. Emily’s still adjusting. I want to make sure she’s okay.”\n\n \n\n She smiles sweetly, but looks disappointed. “Okay. I understand.”\n\n \n\n “Goodnight,” you tell her.\n \n \n You grimace, apologetic. “I should really get back. Emily’s still adjusting. I want to make sure she’s okay.”\n\n \n\n She smiles sweetly, but looks disappointed. “Okay. Well at least I’ll get some sleep tonight. As you tend to keep me awake past my bedtime.”\n\n \n\n You give her a grin. “I’ll get going, then. Don’t want to disturb your beauty sleep.\"\n\n \n\n “Am I not beautiful enough for you?” she asks mockingly as you move to the door.\n\n \n\n “Goodnight,” you tell her, and lean in to kiss her lightly on the lips.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “I supposed I could stay this evening,” you say, returning her glint. She grins and stands. “Let me just… freshen up. Can you put the dishes in the dish washer?”\n\n \n\n She reaches over and presses her lips to your forehead, before turning and sauntering through into her bedroom. The door closes quietly, leaving you sitting in Jennifer’s apartment. You stand and make yourself busy, loading the dishwasher under the sink.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, just as you're finishing up, you hear the bedroom door creak. “Are you coming?” you hear her purr.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You move over to the bed, leaning down to her to give her a tender kiss. Her gloss makes her lips soft and sticky. She looks up at you, putting her arms either side of her body, pushing her breasts forward.\n\n \n\n The kiss turns to more, as passion takes hold of you. Your lips meet again and again, as your tongue creeps in and meets hers. You reach out, holding on to her shoulder, feeling the strap to her babydoll underneath your firm grip. There is a murmur from within her. You open your eyes and see her staring up at you as your lips part.\n\n \n\n “Do you think…” she murmurs, almost hesitant. “Do you want to… taste me?” Her eyes flicker down her own body, gazing on the hem of her lingerie. Then back up, meeting your gaze. She says nothing more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You nod and smile at her. She hoists herself back further on the bed and lays down, parting her legs to reveal a matching thong over her mound. With her hands, she lifts the hem of her babydoll, revealing all to see.\n\n \n\n Dropping to your knees, your line up your eyes with her and the bed, then lean forward, eagerly moving your lips towards her thong. With a tender caress, you pull the underwear aside. Her hairless, shaved pussy is all you can see. \n\n \n\n You glance up. She looks down her own body, a smile and expectation in her gaze. You grin.\n\n \n\n Your tongue laps at her labia, around the edges, across and upward. She purrs and moans as you touch her. Almost immediately, she grows wet. \n\n \n\n Looking up, you see her head arched back, eyes closed, squirming as your tongue explores the edges of her lips. Then, with a dramatic hesitancy, you slip your tongue between them.\n\n \n\n Her legs instinctively close around your head as she moans. You continue to lap at her private area, tasting her juices as they begin to grow. She squeaks with pleasure.\n\n \n\n Then, there’s a tapping against your hair. Glancing up, you see Jennifer panting, smiling, but looking at you. “I think I’m ready,” she murmurs. To emphasise, she pulls herself further back up on the bed, parting her legs even more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I’ve got a better idea,” you say. Taking her hand, you pull her from the bed, then rest your remaining one on her shoulder. Gently pushing downwards.\n\n \n\n Understanding crosses her eyes. She lets you push her down, and she kneels at your feet, staring up at you, her hem riding her and exposing her matching thong underneath it. \n\n \n\n \n You smile as she reaches forward. Unbuckling your belt. Pulling your trousers down just enough to see your boxer shorts. You see her eyes widen as she notices you are already stiff underneath the cotton fabric.\n\n \n\n Her delicate hands reach up, and free your large dick from your underwear. It springs out almost into her face. She runs her fingers over it. Almost nervously.\n\n \n\n “I always forget,” she whispers.\n\n \n\n The words escape your mouth before you can stop yourself. “Suck it.”\n\n \n\n She nods and moves her face forward, running her tongue over the tip. Then, cautiously, wraps her lips around it and sucks on the end. You sigh with euphoria. \n\n \n\n Using her dainty hand, she feeds your cock into her tiny mouth, taking more and more of its length inside. You watch from above, as your girlfriend bobs up and down, her glossy lips smearing as she takes your prick deeper towards her throat.\n\n \n\n \"You're so good at this,\" you whisper, reaching out to pull her head further towards your body. She relaxes and you feel it hit her tonsils. There’s a look on her face, but she holds your eyes with her own until you release her. She gasps, then looks back up at you. A small smile.\n\n \n\n “I think you’re ready,” she says. She stands, leans back towards the bed, and shifts back on to it, parting her legs as she lies down.\n\n \n You smile as she reaches forward. Unbuckling your belt. Pulling your trousers down just enough to see your boxer shorts. You see her eyes widen as she notices you are already stiff underneath the cotton fabric.\n\n \n\n Her delicate hands reach up, and free your dick from your underwear. It springs out in front of her. She runs her fingers over it tenderly.\n\n \n\n “Someone’s excited,” she whispers.\n\n \n\n The words escape your mouth before you can stop yourself. “Suck it.”\n\n \n\n She nods and moves her face forward, running her tongue over the tip. Then, cautiously, wraps her lips around it and sucks on the end. You sigh with euphoria. \n\n \n\n Using her dainty hand, she feeds your cock into her tiny mouth, taking more of its length inside. You watch from above, as your girlfriend bobs up and down, her glossy lips smearing as she takes your prick deeper towards her throat.\n\n \n\n \"You're so good at this,\" you whisper, reaching out to pull her head further towards your body. She relaxes and you feel it inside her. You don’t quite get back to hitting her tonsils, but she holds your eyes with her own until you release her. She sighs, then looks back up at you. A small smile.\n\n \n\n “I think you’re ready,” she says. She stands, leans back towards the bed, and shifts back on to it, parting her legs as she lies down.\n\n \n You smile as she reaches forward. Unbuckling your belt. Pulling your trousers down just enough to see your boxer shorts. You see her eyes look curiously, as if searching for something that isn’t there.\n\n \n\n Her delicate hands reach up, and free your small dick from your underwear. It falls out in front of her. Fitting easily into her hand.\n\n \n\n “Nice,” she whispers.\n\n \n\n The words escape your mouth before you can stop yourself. “Can you suck it?”\n\n \n\n She looks at you, but then nods and moves her face forward, running her tongue over the tip. Then wraps her lips around it and sucks it. You sigh with euphoria. \n\n \n\n Using her dainty hand, she feeds your cock into her mouth, easily taking it taking its length inside. You watch from above, as your girlfriend bobs up and down, her glossy lips smearing as she ingests your penis.\n\n \n\n \"You're so good at this,\" you whisper, reaching out to pull her head further towards your body. She relaxes and you feel your prick inside her. The sensation barely changes, and she holds your eyes with her own until you release her. She just looks back up at you. \n\n \n\n “I think you’re ready,” she says. She stands, leans back towards the bed, and shifts back on to it, parting her legs as she lies down.\n\n \n You smile as she reaches forward. Unbuckling your belt. Pulling your trousers down just enough to see your boxer shorts. You see her eyes look around. Confused.\n\n \n\n Her delicate hands reach up, and free your tiny dick from your underwear. It falls out over your boxers. She holds it, looking tiny in her palm.\n\n \n\n “It is cold tonight,” she says, apologetic.\n\n \n\n The words escape your mouth before you can stop yourself. “Do you think you can suck it?\"\n\n \n\n She looks at you, raising an eyebrow. She moves her face forward, running her tongue over it. Then wraps her lips around it takes it in her mouth in one move. You sigh with euphoria. \n\n \n\n You watch from above, as your girlfriend bobs up and down, her glossy lips smearing as she blows you with ease. \n\n \n\n \"You're so good at this,\" you whisper, reaching out to pull her head further towards your body. She doesn’t react. The sensation barely changes, and she holds your eyes with her own until you release her. She just looks back up at you. \n\n \n\n “I think you’re ready,” she says, with a little hesitancy. She stands, leans back towards the bed, and shifts back on to it, parting her legs as she lies down.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You climb on to the bed, pulling your trousers down as you do so. Straddling her, you take your top off and cast it aside.\n\n \n\n \n She appraises you from beneath, eyes lingering on your chest and your large erect member, hovering above her exposed pussy. “Fuck me,” she whispers, breathlessly.\n\n \n\n Without needing more assurance, you reach down and guide your prick towards her. You massage her clit with a finger and thumb, then cautiously drive your dick inside.\n\n \n\n She moans as its girth stretches her wide, continuing to whimper as you rock back and forth, driving it deeper and deeper still. You arch your back, reaching out to pull down her negligee and play with her nipples before lust overcomes you and you focus your efforts on your thrusts.\n\n \n\n You feel Jennifer’s legs grip the side of your torso. Wrap around your body as she lies otherwise inert underneath your body. You see her bite her bottom lip, but she can’t control the screams of pleasure that fall from her throat.\n\n \n\n “Oh god!” she murmurs suddenly, arching her back and pushing her body against yours. The shriek is loud, uncontrolled and unashamed. \n\n \n\n It’s enough to send you over the edge. You can feel it within you. You need to cum. Now.\n\n \n\n You glance down at Jennifer, in the throes of post-orgasmic bliss. She catches your eye. Expectantly.\n\n \n She appraises you from beneath, eyes lingering on your chest and your erect member, hovering above her exposed pussy. “Fuck me,” she whispers.\n\n \n\n Without needing more assurance, you reach down and guide your prick towards her. You massage her clit with a finger and thumb, then cautiously drive your dick inside.\n\n \n\n She moans as you enter, continuing to pant as you rock back and forth, driving it deeper. You arch your back, reaching out to pull down her negligee and play with her nipples, before gingerly reaching to twist your own. Then lust overcomes you and you focus your efforts on your thrusts.\n\n \n\n You feel Jennifer’s legs part a little more, pushing back at you with her own gyrating. She murmurs and moans as pleasure escapes from her mouth.\n\n \n\n “Oh god” she says suddenly, arching her back and pushing her body further against yours. Her cry is loud and without restraint.\n\n \n\n It’s enough to send you over the edge. You can feel it within you. You need to cum. Now.\n\n \n\n You glance down at Jennifer, in the throes of post-orgasmic bliss. She catches your eye. Expectantly.\n\n \n She appraises you from beneath, eyes lingering on your small mounds and enlarged nipples that you feel have become erect. They linger a little too long. “Fuck me,” she whispers.\n\n \n\n Without needing more assurance, you reach down and guide your prick towards her. You massage her clit with a finger and thumb, then cautiously drive your dick inside.\n\n \n\n She murmurs as you enter, making appreciative noises as you rock back and forth, driving it deeper. You arch your back, reaching out to pull down her negligee and play with her nipples, then reach up to your own. You gasp at the touch. Almost more than from the sensation of fucking your girlfriend.\n\n \n\n You feel Jennifer’s legs part a little more and notice she’s pulled them wide with her hands, giving you room to get deeper into her. She pants as she pulls at her legs.\n\n \n\n “Oh” she whispers suddenly, arching her back and pushing her body further against yours. You feel her shudder.\n\n \n\n It’s enough to send you over the edge. You can feel it within you. You need to cum. Now.\n\n \n\n You glance down at Jennifer, in the throes of post-orgasmic bliss. She catches your eye. Expectantly.\n\n \n She appraises you from beneath, eyes lingering on your breasts with narrowed eyes. You see her shake her head, as if to dismiss the thought. “Fuck me,” she says, almost flatly.\n\n \n\n Without needing more assurance, you reach down and guide your prick towards her. You massage her clit with a finger and thumb, then cautiously drive your dick inside.\n\n \n\n She looks down as you enter, watching you rock back and forth. There is no need to drive it deeper. Within a few thrusts, everything you have is within her. You arch your back, reaching out to pull down her negligee and play with her nipples, but can’t help but reach up your own. You cup your breasts and massage them, just as would with your girlfriend. You gasp at your own touch and realise this turns you on more than what you’re doing with your cock.\n\n \n\n You feel Jennifer’s legs part and notice she’s pulled them back with her hands, almost pulling them up to her chin, trying to you deeper inside her. She looks back at you through them, wincing as she watches you play with your nipples.\n\n \n\n It's enough to send you over the edge. You can feel it within you. You need to cum. Now.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You can’t help it. Or so you tell yourself. With a moan, you feel your thrusting increase and then all too quick your orgasm is upon you. “Ah! I’m cumming!”\n\n \n\n You feel your large dick empty deep inside Jennifer’s womb. One spurt. Two. A third. The ecstasy threatens to overcome you. By the time you're finished, you collapse forward, lying against Jennifer’s body. “Did you just come inside me?” you hear her ask. \n\n \n\n You pull your head back to look at her. She raises an eyebrow. “I thought we weren’t going to risk that? Even if I am on the pill.”\n\n \n\n “Sorry,” you say. “I couldn’t stop.”\n\n \n\n She sighs and pushes you off her. You glance back at her. There’s a slight twinge of frustration on her face, but she gives you an understanding smile. “Just try not to in future. Doctor Palmer… let’s just say his birth control prescriptions are prone to accidents.”\n\n \n\n You nod, wondering how that might happen. She gets off the bed and looks down to her legs. She sniggers. “That was a lot. I better clean up.” \n\n \n\n She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. Her eyes lingering on your dick, still large even as it becomes flaccid. She grins. “And that was… amazing.”\n\n \n\n You grin as she exits and lay back down on the bed. Thinking about how you emptied your balls into her body. It was… hot.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, she returns. Make-up removed. And everything else. “Your turn,” she says. “Then we snuggle.”\n\n \n You can’t help it. Or so you tell yourself. With a moan, you feel your thrusting increase and then all too quick your orgasm is upon you. “Ah! I’m cumming!”\n\n \n\n You feel your dick empty deep inside Jennifer’s womb. One spurt. Then another. You tug at your dick one final time and feel waves of endorphins flood through your body. By the time you're finished, you collapse forward, lying against Jennifer’s body. “Did you just come inside me?” you hear her ask.\n\n \n\n You pull your head back to look at her. She raises an eyebrow. “I thought we weren’t going to risk that? Even if I am on the pill.”\n\n \n\n “Sorry,” you say. “I couldn’t stop.”\n\n \n\n She sighs and pushes you off her. You glance back at her. There’s a slight twinge of frustration on her face, but she gives you an understanding smile. “Just try not to in future. Doctor Palmer… let’s just say his birth control prescriptions are prone to accidents.”\n\n \n\n You nod, wondering how that might happen. She gets off the bed and looks down to her legs. She sighs. “Been a while, hasn’t it. I better clean up.” \n\n \n\n She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. Her eyes lingering on your dick even as it becomes flaccid. She grins. “That was… good.”\n\n \n\n You grin as she exits and lay back down on the bed. Thinking about how you came inside her body.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, she returns. Make-up removed. And everything else. “Your turn,” she says. “Then we snuggle.”\n \n \n You can’t help it. Or so you tell yourself. With a moan, you feel your thrusting increase and then all too quick your orgasm is upon you. “Ah! I’m cumming!”\n\n \n\n You feel your dick spurt inside Jennifer’s womb. Something inside you stirs and you instinctively reach up your nipples, twisting them roughly. The sensation is enough to trigger yet another spurt of your cum, shooting up inside your girlfriend. Then you collapse forward, lying against Jennifer’s body. “Did you just come inside me?” you hear her ask. \n\n \n\n You pull your head back to look at her. She raises an eyebrow. “I thought we weren’t going to risk that? Even if I am on the pill.”\n\n \n\n “Sorry,” you say. “I couldn’t stop.”\n\n \n\n She sighs and pushes you off her. You glance back at her. There’s a slight twinge of frustration on her face, but she gives you an understanding smile. “Just try not to in future. Doctor Palmer… let’s just say his birth control prescriptions are prone to accidents.”\n\n \n\n You nod, wondering how that might happen. She gets off the bed and looks down to her legs, with a slight confusion. But she shrugs it off. “I better touch up.” \n\n \n\n She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. There’s something in her eyes. Almost a vacancy. “That was… nice,” she says.\n\n \n\n You watch her go, then lay back down on the bed. Thinking about the feeling of playing with your nipples as you came.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, she returns. Make-up removed. “Your turn,” she says. “Then we snuggle.”\n\n \n You can’t help it. Or so you tell yourself. With a moan, you feel your thrusting increase and then all too quick your orgasm is upon you. “Ah! I’m cumming!”\n\n \n\n A small wave of endorphins move through your body, as a small spurt of semen shoots from your dick. Then… it’s over. Without realising it, your fingers drift up to cup your breasts and gently pinch your nipples. The gasp creates more ecstasy than you ejaculating. Then you collapse forward, lying against Jennifer’s body. “Did you just come inside me?” you hear her ask. \n\n \n\n You pull your head back to look at her. She raises an eyebrow. “I thought we weren’t going to risk that? Even if I am on the pill.”\n\n \n\n “Sorry,” you say. “I couldn’t stop.”\n\n \n\n She sighs and pushes you off her. You glance back at her. There’s a slight twinge of frustration on her face, but she gives you an understanding smile. “Just try not to in future. Doctor Palmer… let’s just say his birth control prescriptions are prone to accidents.”\n\n \n\n You nod, wondering how that might happen. She gets off the bed and looks down to her legs, with a slight confusion. “Are you sure you came?” When you nod, she looks at you curiously. “I should take off my make-up,” she adds. \n\n \n\n She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. Frowning. Confused. Eyes narrowed. She says nothing. \n\n \n\n You watch her go, then lay back down on the bed. Thinking about the feeling of playing with your breasts. Aching to do it again.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, she returns. Make-up removed. “Your turn,” she says. “Then we snuggle.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You pull out and point your large dick up in the air, massaging it vigorously. In an instant Jennifer reacts, pulling her babydoll up. Just in time as jets of sticky white semen to land on her stomach. One spurt. Two. A third. You tug at your dick one final time and feel waves of endorphins flood through your body.\n\n \n\n By the time to you sigh in elation, Jennifer’s stomach is covered in your spunk. She looks up at you, smiling politely. After a moment, she whispers. “That was a lot.”\n\n \n\n Residual cum drips from your tip as you pull yourself off her, grinning. She reaches to a tissue box beside her bed and dabs at her body. In spite of her efforts, no amount of tissues can help.\n\n \n\n “I better clean up,” she says, sliding off the bed. She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. Her eyes lingering on your dick, still large even as it becomes flaccid. She grins. “And that was… amazing.”\n\n \n\n You grin as she exits and lay back down on the bed. Thinking about her body as semen spilled from your prick. She looked hot.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, she returns. Make-up removed. And everything else. “Your turn,” she says. “Then we snuggle.”\n\n \n You pull out and point your dick up in the air, massaging it vigorously. In an instant Jennifer reacts, pulling her babydoll up. Just in time as jets of sticky white semen land on her stomach. One spurt. Then another. You tug at your dick one final time and feel waves of endorphins flood through your body.\n\n \n\n By the time to you sigh in elation, Jennifer’s stomach is splattered with your cum. She looks up at you, smiling politely. After a moment, she whispers. “Been a while, has it?”\n\n \n\n Residual cum drips from your tip as you pull yourself off her, grinning. She reaches to a tissue box beside her bed and dabs at her body. She manages to remove most of it.\n\n \n\n “I better clean up,” she says, sliding off the bed. She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. Her eyes lingering on your dick even as it becomes flaccid. She grins. “That was… good.”\n\n \n\n You grin as she exits and lay back down on the bed. Thinking about her body with your semen over it.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, she returns. Make-up removed. And everything else. “Your turn,” she says. “Then we snuggle.”\n\n \n You pull out and point your dick up in the air, massaging it vigorously. In an instant Jennifer reacts, pulling her babydoll up. Just in time as a spurt of sticky white semen lands on her stomach. Something inside you stirs and you instinctively reach up your nipples, twisting them roughly. The sensation is enough to trigger yet another spurt of your cum, falling on her bellybutton.\n\n \n\n Glancing down, you see two threads of spunk across Jennifer’s body. She looks up at you, a little unsure. After a moment, she just nods.\n\n \n\n A small amount of residual cum drips from your tip as you pull yourself off her. She reaches to a tissue box beside her bed and dabs at her stomach. By the time she’s finished, there’s no sign of your load.\n\n \n\n “I better touch up,” she says, sliding off the bed. She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. There’s something in her eyes. Almost a vacancy. “That was… nice,” she says.\n\n \n\n You watch her go, then lay back down on the bed. Thinking about the feeling of playing with your nipples as you came.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, she returns. Make-up removed. “Your turn,” she says. “Then we snuggle.”\n\n \n You pull out and point your dick up in the air, massaging it vigorously. In an instant Jennifer reacts, pulling her babydoll up. Just in time as a small spurt semen lands on her stomach. Then… it’s over. Without realising it, your fingers drift up to cup your breasts and gently pinch your nipples. The gasp creates more ecstasy than you ejaculating.\n\n \n\n Glancing down, you see a small stream of spunk on Jennifer’s stomach, She looks up at you, a nose turned up. After a moment, she asks. “Are you done?”\n\n \n\n There is no residual cum as you pull yourself off her. She reaches to a tissue box beside her bed and wipes only once to remove your load. \n\n \n\n “I should take off my make-up,” she says, sliding off the bed. She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. Frowning. Confused. Eyes narrowed. She says nothing. \n\n \n\n You watch her go, then lay back down on the bed. Thinking about the feeling of playing with your breasts. Aching to do it again.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, she returns. Make-up removed. “Your turn,” she says. “Then we snuggle.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You pull out and clamber over Jennifer’s torso, legs astride her chest, directing your large shaft towards her face. She looks up at you, expression muted, and you feel her arms flinch as they are pinned down beneath your thighs. But she doesn’t say anything.\n\n \n\n Tugging at your dick one final time, you feel waves of endorphins flood through your body as sticky white semen coats Jennifer’s made-up face. Your large member pumps hard, full of cum. One spurt. Two. A third.\n\n \n\n By the time to you sigh in elation, Jennifer’s eyes and cheeks are covered in your spunk. She looks up at you, smiling politely. After a moment, she whispers. “That was a lot.”\n\n \n\n Residual cum drips from your tip as you pull yourself off her, grinning. She reaches to a tissue box beside her bed and dabs at her face. In spite of her efforts, no amount of tissues can help.\n\n \n\n “I better clean up,” she says, sliding off the bed. She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. Her eyes lingering on your dick, still large even as it becomes flaccid. She grins. “And that was… amazing.”\n\n \n\n You grin as she exits and lay back down on the bed. Thinking about her face as semen spilled from your prick.

Your member pumps hard, full of cum. One spurt. Then another.\n\n \n\n By the time to you sigh in elation, Jennifer’s forehead is splattered with your spunk. She looks up at you, smiling politely. After a moment, she whispers. “Been a while, hasn’t it?”\n\n \n\n Residual cum drips from your tip as you pull yourself off her, grinning. She reaches to a tissue box beside her bed and dabs at her face. She manages to remove most of it.\n\n \n\n “I better clean up,” she says, sliding off the bed. She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. Her eyes lingering on your dick, even as it becomes flaccid.

Something inside you stirs and you instinctively reach up your nipples, twisting them roughly. The sensation is enough to trigger yet another spurt of your cum, falling over Jennifer’s lips. \n\n \n\n Glancing down, you see two threads of spunk across Jennifer’s made-up face. She looks up at you, a little unsure. After a moment, she just nods.\n\n \n\n A small amount of residual cum drips from your tip as you pull yourself off her. She reaches to a tissue box beside her bed and dabs at her face. By the time she’s finished, there’s no sign of your load.\n\n \n\n “I better touch up,” she says, sliding off the bed.

She looks up at you, eyes narrowed, and you feel her arms flinch as they are pinned down beneath your thighs. But she doesn’t say anything.\n\n \n\n Tugging at your dick one final time, you feel a small wave of endorphins move through your body as a small spurt of semen hits Jennifer’s made-up face. Then… it’s over. Without realising it, your fingers drift up to cup your breasts and gently pinch your nipples. The gasp creates more ecstasy than you ejaculating.\n\n \n\n Glancing down, you see a small stream of spunk on Jennifer’s cheek. She looks up at you, a nose turned up. After a moment, she asks. “Are you done?”\n\n \n\n There is no residual cum as you pull yourself off her. She reaches to a tissue box beside her bed and wipes only once to remove your load. \n\n \n\n “I should take off my make-up,” she says, sliding off the bed. She glances back at you as she heads towards the bedroom door. Frowning. Confused. Eyes narrowed. She says nothing. \n\n \n\n You watch her go, then lay back down on the bed. Thinking about the feeling of playing with your breasts. Aching to do it again.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, she returns. Make-up removed. “Your turn,” she says. “Then we snuggle.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You go to the bathroom and sort yourself out, taking the opportunity to brush your teeth with the same toothbrush Jennifer bought you. By the time you return to the bedroom, Jennifer is snuggling tucked up underneath the sheets.\n\n \n\n \n You slide in and wrap your arms around her. She pushes back into your manly torso, wrapping your arms around her. “Goodnight, handsome” she purrs.\n\n \n\n After you are certain she has gone to sleep, you roll off to the other side. Smiling at the sight of Jennifer sleeping peacefully. \n\n \n You slide in and wrap your arms around her. She pushes back against you, inadvertently causing the fabric of her satin babydoll to rub against your sensitive chest. “Goodnight” she purrs.\n\n \n\n After you are certain she has gone to sleep, you roll off to the other side. Smiling at the sight of Jennifer sleeping peacefully. Dismissing the sensation of her lingerie rubbing against you.\n\n \n You slide in and try to wrap your arms around her, but you have to pull yourself up the bed in order to get over her being closer to her height than you remembered. She pushes back against you, pushing against your small mounds and bare nipples. You feel them stiffen at the touch of her satin babydoll. “Are you alright?” she asks. \n\n \n\n As you spoon, Jennifer squirms and wriggles against your chest. Uncomfortable, unsettled. Eventually she untangles herself from your arms. Even in the darkness, you see her staring at your mounds. “Night”.\n\n \n\n You roll off to the other side. Thinking about her restlessness. When you are certain she’s gone to sleep, you can’t help but run a finger over your nipple. And bite your lip to prevent a gasp.\n\n \n You slide in and try to wrap your arms around her, just tall enough to be able to do so if you lean up in the bed. She pushes back against you and you feel her satin babydoll press against your breasts. You can’t help but gasp. Even in the darkness, you see her staring at your breasts.\n\n \n\n She says nothing, but then rolls back over, facing away from you. Mumbling something unintelligible. You roll off to the other side. Thinking about her reaction. When you are certain she’s gone to sleep, you reach up and run your hands over your chest. Cupping your breasts and recalling the sensation of the satin against them.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “Hey,” you begin. “This is going to sound funny, but I had a dream...\"\n\n \n\n Jennifer eyes you curiously. “What sort of dream?”\n\n \n\n “I dreamed that I was having coffee with you,” you begin. “When we first became friends. Except, we were interrupted by Dan Mandel. From work. He wouldn’t shut up about men being men.”\n\n “I dreamed of one of our first dates,” you begin. “Except, we were interrupted by Dan Mandel. From work. He wouldn’t shut up about men being men.”\n\n \n \n Jennifer frowns. “At Fresh Pot, right? I remember that. He was infuriating. Don’t you?”\n\n \n\n You feel your mouth drop open, but you can’t think why. “Yes,” you say. “I remember.”\n\n \n\n She tilts her head as she watches you for a moment. “Are you okay, ?”\n\n \n\n A sigh escapes your lips. “I don’t know,” you say quietly. “Jen, do I look different to you?”\n\n \n\n She gives you an appraising look. “Maybe you’ve lost some weight. I imagine the stress isn’t helping.”\n\n \n\n “Nothing… strange,” you try. “Like, magically strange?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s green eyes flicker over you. “I don’t sense anything,” she mutters. Then takes a deep breath. “Maybe try to limit your exposure to whatever you’re doing. I can’t say it enough, . Be careful.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “I wanted to ask,” you begin. “Do you know of any spell that could let someone be in two places at once?\"\n\n \n\n This grabs Jennifer’s attention. “What have you done, ?”\n\n \n\n “Nothing!”, you stammer. “I’m just curious.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer throws you a dark look. “Curiosity kills cats. And that’s sometimes the most humane thing it can do when it comes to magic.”\n\n \n\n “I just think it would help,” you try. “With everything that’s going on.”\n\n \n\n “ Phillips,” Jennifer says in a matronly manner. “Don’t you dare think about using spells so frivolously. Do you have any idea what sort of power you’d need to use to do something like that?”\n\n \n\n “But Jen -”\n\n \n\n “I don’t want to hear it,” she says. “I’m warning you, don’t mess with this sort of stuff. It’s already too much that you’re in as deep as you are.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “Hey, I thought I saw you the other morning,” you tell her. “Sunday. On Orchid Road.”\n\n \n\n “Oh?” she asks you, nonchalantly. “I mean, I guess I could have been there. I think I was dropping something off at work.”\n\n \n\n You roll you lips, considering her words. “I actually thought I saw you go into the library.”\n\n \n\n “Ah, yes!” Jennifer exclaims. “I was returning a book. Just a travel guide on Prague. I forgot I even had it. Luckily they let me off without a fine. Small towns have small blessings, sometimes.”\n\n \n\n You murmur a groan to yourself. You can’t remember seeing Jennifer reading a travel guide recently. But you leave the matter. For now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “I want to talk to you about Terrence,” you tell Jennifer. \"About what you're doing with him in the library.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes widen for a moment, then narrow. \"Someone's been talking,\" she says. \"Or have *they*?\"\n”Have you been spying on me, ?”\n\n \n\n “It doesn’t matter, Jen,” you say. “I want to know what’s going on. I think it’s only fair, given what happened before.”\n\n \n\n “I’ve been tutoring him,” she says, looking away from you for just the briefest of moments. “He needed some help with biology. His mother mentioned it to me at work. I felt sorry for him, so I offered.”\n\n \n\n You suck in air. “That’s another lie,” you tell her. “That wasn’t tutoring you were doing. What's really going on. What’s this got to do with Annie?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer grits her teeth. “This has got nothing to do with you, . I’m not doing anything wrong. I’m helping him.”\n\n \n\n “Then talk to me,” you plead. “Why won’t you just tell me what’s going on?”\n\n \n\n She looks back with you in defeat. “Fine,” she whispers. “Ask.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n “So what happened with Annie?” you begin. “What exactly happened to her at school?”\n\n \n\n “I don’t want to dwell on the past, . That’s dead and buried. I can’t change that. It happened long before you had even heard of Charlton.”\n\n \n\n “But it’s worth mentioning to Terrence?” you retort.\n\n \n\n “For good reasons that I don’t want to go into,” Jennifer says, struggling to retain a sense of calm. “I don’t see why you’re so fixated on Annie Clancy. Terrence is the one that needs helping.” She exhales, forcing frustration out of her voice. “Annie has had to learn to take care of herself.”\n\n \n\n “So you won’t tell me what happened?” \n\n \n\n Jennifer looks at you. She lets the moment hang, as indecision plays across her face. After a long pause, she sighs. Her eyes temporarily without the anger. Now almost pleading.\n\n \n\n “I don’t even let myself think about it, . And I definitely don’t want to talk about it.”\n\n \n\n There's a sense of deflation in her posture. She looks to you, already tired. \"Just... Annie had a hard time at school,\" she adds. \"And now Terrence is going through it. I don't want what happened before to happen again. Not when this time, I might be able to help.\"\n\n \n\n \"But you won't get into specifics about what happened?\" you snap.\n\n \n\n She shakes her head. \"Because I know you. You'll get involved. And that might make everything worse.\"\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n “What’s going to happen to Terrence?” you ask her directly. “What are the cheerleaders planning?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer gives you a look. Your words are left to hang. You watch as some frustration drips away. “You need to believe me, , when I say they are setting him up for something big.”\n\n \n\n \"What does that mean?\"\n\n \n\n \"Come on, ,\" she says with exhaustion. \"You know what they are. But it's more than charms - curses - that they're planning.\"\n \n \n\n “But you won’t tell me what?” you say, trying to contain your frustration.\n\n \n\n Jen steadies herself, almost catching her words as they threaten to come out. “I can’t,” she finally says. “You’ll just want to try something. To counter them. And that will bring me into it. And then everything escalates. It will be like a war. One I can’t win.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at Jennifer. She looks genuine and sincere. Her green eyes pleading with you.\n\n \n\n “The best I can do is get him through. That’s all we both can do.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n “I don’t know what to do about this,” you say.\n\n \n\n “Can you not just trust me?” Jennifer asks.\n\n \n \n You look back at her. Back at the person you thought until recently you knew. \n\n \n\n “I need time to think,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n She looks to the floor like she’s lost. But nods. “Just promise me you won’t do anything rash.”\n\n \n\n You look at Jen, but the words won’t come. Instead, you walk out the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “First of all,” you begin. “Why did you come over this morning?”\n\n \n\n She hesitates, considering. Then reaches into her pocket and pulls something small out, holding it up for you to see. An acorn. Plain. Ordinary. But you feel it pulsing with latent energy. \n\n \n\n “It arrived this morning in the mail” she says. “If you’re wondering why your forget spell wouldn’t take, this is your answer. It’s a nullification charm.”\n\n \n\n You look at the acorn in Jennifer’s hand. You feel its power before Jennifer pockets it. “I knew it for what it was, instantly. I didn’t think I’d ever see one again. Didn’t think I’d need one to protect myself. Especially from you.”\n\n \n\n She lets the disappointment in her voice hang. Then she reaches into another pocket and throws down something on to the sheets. “It came with this.”\n\n \n\n You instinctively reach forward, then remember how little you’re wearing. And what you look like underneath. You pull the covers up across your breasts. \n\n \n\n “Oh come on, ,” Jen says, with a hint of humour. “It’s not like I haven’t seen them before.”\n\n \n\n Even so, you reach forward slowly to pick it up, careful not to flash Jennifer. It’s a scrap of paper with scrawled words in black ink:\n\n \n\n Go see them. They know. You’re ready now. – S.\n\n \n\n You glance at the initial. 'S'. Faint laughter echoes through your brain. Siobhan.\n\n \n\n \"Somehow, I knew it meant you,” Jennifer says, flatly.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “I know what happened between you and Annie,” you begin. “In the cafeteria. How Skye picked on Annie. And you stood by and didn’t do anything at all.”\n\n \n\n There is a look of resigned acceptance on Jennifer’s face as she mulls over your words. “I thought if I stayed silent, I wouldn’t have to pick sides. That was my mistake. Silence was a side.”\n\n \n\n “So you regret not standing up for her?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She looks at you, then nods. “Annie might have been a bitch sometimes towards me, especially around that time. But I shouldn’t have allowed that. No one deserves to be picked on at school.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “When you tried out for the cheerleader team. You told Skye that you weren’t friends. That you outgrew her. But she still came to see you try-out.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s anger spikes up again. “Did she? Or did she come to mock me for trying out for the cheerleaders. I don’t know if you got the full story from your magic spell, . I don’t remember Annie being enthusiastic about me trying out.” \n\n \n\n “You still ditched her,” you say. \n\n \n\n “Maybe,” she retorts. “But you still don’t get it, do you? I didn’t have an easy time making friends. I got picked on too. And Annie? Well, we drifted apart before that. When Penny entered her life.”\n\n \n\n You give her a look. “You sound jealous?”\n\n \n\n Jen takes a short breath before replying. “Maybe I was. But I was alone. Annie wasn’t exactly reaching out. And Skye promised me… everything.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “What about Penny and Annie?” you say. “I saw them in the classroom. When you agreed to help Skye use magic on her.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer casts her head back, looking up at the ceiling. A long breath escapes from her mouth. Her head wilts. You notice her eyes are closed. For what seems like eternity, she just stands there.\n\n \n\n When she opens them, they look dull and lifeless. “I did,” she says flatly. “I did that. I thought I was helping.”\n\n \n\n “By using magic on her?” you bark.\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s eyes narrow, locking directly on to you. An eyebrow spikes up. “Are you going to lecture me about using magic on people you care about?”\n\n \n\n You fall silent. \n\n \n\n “If it makes any difference,” she continues after a pause. “I still thought the curses were charms. Helping people study. Become better versions of themselves. I grew up here, . Some of the things they teach you. It’s not just the magic. It’s indoctrination. From a young age.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “You helped Skye mess with Annie’s head,” you tell her. It’s framed not as a question. “It’s the reason her and Penny drifted apart.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes meet yours, glaring with a flash of anger. “You forget that I know a thing or two about magic, . How that forget spell of yours works is not that far away from what I did. Not by a long shot.”\n\n \n\n “I’ve not been changing people,” you tell her. “Just making them forget.”\n\n \n\n “That’s how it starts,” Jen replies, skeptically. “One day a nudge to forget you had a bad exam and restore some confidence, the next a slight tweak to someone’s perception of you. Then one day, you’re playing around with somebody’s brain.”\n\n \n\n “Is this how it started?” you ask. “With Annie. Small things.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer nods. “That’s how it works. The coven gives people a little push. And when they stop running towards what they want, another push to make them run towards it again.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “And the ritual?” you quiz her. “In the school gym? That’s when you turned your back on them.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks to the floor, finally defeated. “I couldn’t go through with it. That time. I said it was too much. It wasn’t what I signed up for.”\n\n \n\n You digest the information, thinking of the ramifications of that one night. “Is that why Annie is the way she is?” \n\n \n\n Jennifer looks up at you, curiously. “I think Annie is a lot more complex than you give her credit for. In spite of being the most appalling person to me since we grew apart. But if you mean… why is how she is around guys?” Jennifer silently nods.\n\n \n\n “And you couldn’t have stopped them,” you ask.\n\n \n\n “That ritual is powerful,” Jennifer replies. “There’s a reason that the school is full of minor tricks and curses. You don’t see total brainwashing at Charlton everyday, do you?” \n\n \n\n You consider her words. Nod. \n\n \n\n “Four people with enough power to pull that off?” she continues. “Again just me. I might have held my own back then against Skye, but not with the rest of them ready to gang up on me.”\n\n \n\n “And you didn’t think to try and help Annie after that?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer grimaces and squeezes her eyes shut. When she opens them, they glisten. “If I had done anything, they would have come after me. So I get to still live my life as me. However bad that might be.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “That’s all I’ve got,” you tell her. “For now.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer nods and sits down at the foot of your bed. All rage now lost in her. You sit there in silence for long moments, both not wanting to speak.\n\n \n\n \n “I didn’t mean for it to go that far,” she mumbles. “I told them I didn’t want to hurt her. I told Skye that.” She swallows. “But no. I didn’t stop it, either.”\n\n \n “Anything else to add?” you finally say.\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks up at you and shakes her head. Whether or not Jennifer knows anything more seems incidental. She doesn’t appear willing to share anymore.\n\n \n \n \n “And what about Terrence?” you say. “What’s going to happen to him?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s gaze drifts to the window, the morning daylight creeping into the room. She doesn’t turn back immediately. When she does, her eyes hold a quiet hardness. “He’s next.”\n\n \n\n You lean forward, pulse quickening. “Next for what?”\n\n \n\n Her chin lifts, looking at you. “Correction,” she says with disdain. “Like Annie. Maybe worse.”\n\n \n\n You feel your anger rising once more. “And you’re just going to let it happen again?”\n\n \n\n “That's why I'm helping him!” she exclaims. “If the coven think he’s already changed, they won’t bother with the ritual.”\n\n \n\n “I think it’s too late for that,” you say flatly. “I bet Christina wants to prove her power. By equaling Skye.”\n\n \n\n Jen puts her head in her palm, massaging her forehead. “They’ll do it at night,” she says through gritted teeth. “In the gym. You’ll need to get in there to check. You should be able to hide in the evening whilst they’re doing practice on the field.”\n\n \n\n You digest her words. “Can you help?” \n\n \n\n Her eyes settle on yours. “If they find out I’m involved, they’ll be consequences. I know Christina. She won’t just come for me. Other people will get hurt.”\n\n \n\n “So you’re not going to do anything?” you ask. “Again.”\n\n \n\n \n Jennifer winces, once more scrunching her eyes up for a moment. “I can create something for you. To help you sneak in. It won’t be traced back to me. If you’re smart, you can stop it before they even know what’s happening.”\n\n \n\n She rises, adjusting her clothes. “I’ll drop it off at lunchtime.”\n\n \n\n “Is that it?” you ask. “You’re leaving?”\n\n \n\n “I need some time,” she murmurs, voice low. “Time to… handle this. To handle us. And what all of this means.”\n\n “I need some time,” she murmurs, voice low. “Time to… handle this. And what all of this means.”\n\n \n\n “After you deal with Terrence,” she says, pausing. Her eyes lock on yours, vulnerability and steel entwined in their depths. “Come by. We’ll talk.”\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Jennifer winces, once more scrunching her eyes up for a moment. “I can't, . You don't know what will happen if they find out.”\n \n \n\n “Is that it?” you ask. “You’re leaving?”\n\n \n\n “I need some time,” she murmurs, voice low. “Time to… handle this. To handle us. And what all of this means.”\n\n “I need some time,” she murmurs, voice low. “Time to… handle this. And what all of this means.”\n\n \n\n “After you deal with Terrence,” she says, pausing. Her eyes lock on yours, vulnerability and steel entwined in their depths. “Come by. We’ll talk.”\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n “I don’t know what to think,” she tells you. “I’ve given it a lot of thought. If it was just to find out some information, help Terrence in some way, I think that would be another thing. But, you did more than that. You lived as me. And you did things as me that I wouldn’t have done myself.\n\n \n\n She takes a deep breath. “You know I hate magic,” she says. “I’m trying to get out of here. Leave all this behind.”\n\n \n\n ”I thought we were going to do that together, . Once Emily had graduated, we would skip town. And never come back.”\n\n ”I hoped I’d found a friend who wasn’t part of all this, . Maybe once Emily had graduated, we could even go traveling together. Maybe never even come back.”\n\n \n \n\n She looks away momentarily, as she considers her words. “Now though, you’re involved with it. Magic, curses, the cheerleaders. Believe me, I know about this. It’s going to ruin your life. And I don’t know how to stop it.”\n\n \n\n “I’m being careful,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “No, you’re not,” she tells you flatly. “Being careful is not doing what you did as me. I think part of you likes it. You’re slipping in too far. So I’m going to ask one thing of you. And I promise that will be the last ultimatum I give. Will you stop using magic, and end this?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n “I don’t know what to think,” she tells you. “I’ve given it a lot of thought. You might have just done it to help, Terrence. But you know I hate magic. I’m trying to get out of here. Leave all this behind.”\n\n \n\n ”I thought we were going to do that together, . Once Emily had graduated, we would skip town. And never come back.”\n\n ”I hoped I’d found a friend who wasn’t part of all this, . Maybe once Emily had graduated, we could even go traveling together. Maybe never even come back.”\n\n \n \n\n She looks away momentarily, as she considers her words. “Now though, you’re involved with it. Magic, curses, the cheerleaders. Believe me, I know about this.

So I’m going to ask one thing of you. And I promise that will be the last ultimatum I give. Will you stop using magic, and end this?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n\n \n\n “Okay,” you whisper. “I’ll stop then.” \n\n \n\n Her green eyes fixate on you, looking for duplicity. “Promise?” \n\n \n\n “Promise.”\n\n \n\n She nods and looks to the floor. After a moment, she reaches around her neck and pulls out something from her top. Resting around her neck on a piece of ribbon is an acorn. The acorn.\n\n \n\n “I’ve figured out how your trinket works now,” she says. “I’ve modified the charm. You’ll find that you can no longer transform into me. Ever.”\n\n \n\n “Jen, you can trust me,” you tell her. But she cuts you off. “I think we’ve established that I can’t.”\n\n \n\n “I’m going to be watching, ,” she continues. “I’m going to make sure you’re not sucked into that world. Whatever it takes.”\n\n \n\n ”And what about us?” you ask. “Is that under watch too?”\n\n ”And what about our friendship?” you ask. “Is that under watch too?”\n\n \n\n “Let’s see,” she replies. “It’s not like I haven’t done things that you might not like. But there’s no more secrets to uncover with me, . You know everything now. So it’s really up to you.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “I can’t,” you tell her. “There’s too much at stake, Jen. Too much to do with that school. And Emily. I need to stop it.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks up to you, her sad eyes hardening before you. She sighs. “Need to, or want to?”\n\n \n\n The tone of her voice strikes you as different. Resolved. Hard. Cold. You stare back at her. After a moment, she reaches around her neck and pulls out something from her top. Resting around her neck on a piece of ribbon is an acorn. The acorn.\n\n \n\n “I’ve figured out how your trinket works now,” she says. “I’ve modified the charm. You’ll find that you can no longer transform into me. Ever.”\n\n \n\n “Jen, you can trust me,” you tell her. But she cuts you off. “I think we’ve established that I can’t.”\n \n \n\n You stare at the acorn around her neck. \"What are you saying, Jen?\" \n\n \n\n This stops Jennifer in her tracks. \"I don't know,\" she admits. \"But I'll be watching, . And if I can save you from yourself... and you refuse to do it.... well. I already have a guilty enough conscious for not acting as it is.\"\n\n \n\n ”And what about us?” you ask. “Is that under watch too?”\n\n ”And what about our friendship?” you ask. “Is that under watch too?”\n\n \n\n “Let’s see,” she replies. “It’s not like I haven’t done things that you might not like. But there’s no more secrets to uncover with me, . You know everything now. So it’s really up to you.”\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n “Okay,” you whisper. “I’ll stop then.” \n\n \n\n Her green eyes fixate on you, looking for duplicity. “Promise?” \n\n \n\n “Promise.”\n\n \n\n She nods and looks to the floor. After a moment, she reaches around her neck and pulls out something from her top. Resting around her neck on a piece of ribbon is an acorn. The acorn.\n\n \n\n “I’ve figured out how your trinket works now,” she says. “I've modified the charm. You’ll find that you can no longer transform into me.

But she cuts you off. “I think we’ve established that I can’t.”\n\n \n\n “I’m going to be watching, ,” she continues. “I’m going to make sure you’re not sucked into that world. Whatever it takes.\" She cracks her neck. \"Even this.”\n\n \n\n There is a slight rumble, but you can’t tell where it’s come from. Then, your mental senses are overloaded. Magical power builds inside Jennifer and before you can do a thing, she bursts like an explosion, radiating with magical energy. You hear her scream and shriek, bathed in amber light, and hear the cracking of bones.\n\n \n\n “No”, you whisper, but you feel paralyzed. Unable to turn away, watching through the light as Jennifer’s body shifts and reshapes. \n\n \n\n Then, with a final shriek, the magic fades. Silence fills the void again. And you find yourself staring back... at you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n “What have you…” you stammer. “What have you done?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer flashes you a grin. Your grin. A grin of satisfaction. “I’ve been doing some revision,” she says. But this time, it’s your voice. “Turns out, I’m not as powerless as I thought I was.”\n\n \n\n You feel your mind cracking. Trying to come to terms with the person in front of you. That person looking just like you. \n\n \n\n “If you find you can't stop this after all,” she continues. “Then maybe you should consider my view. Maybe it’s not a case of stopping. If you’re using magic now, maybe I should just embrace it. I don’t want to feel left out. And besides, you seemed to enjoy being me. So maybe we should just switch places. For a while.”\n\n \n\n Another grin. This one darker. More menacing. You feel the power radiating from her. For the first time, you realise, she’s more powerful than you.\n\n \n\n “This is my offer,” Jennifer taunts you. “If you won't stop, I live as you. You live my life. Go to work as me. See how the town treats the cast-off. Then come home and cook for… me. Well, you. Not knowing if you’re ever going to show up. We’ll see if you want to continue living out other people's lives.\"\n\n “This is my offer,” Jennifer taunts you. “If you won't stop, I live as you. And you live my life. Go to work as me. See how the town treats the cast-off. Then come home and throw a dinner party for us. Not knowing if you’re ever going show up. We’ll see if you want to continue living out other people's lives.\"\n \n\n “And if I don’t want this?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Then simple,” Jennifer says in your voice. “Don't do magic. The choice is yours, . But based on how you've behaved as me, I'm betting you won't object.\"\n\n \n\n \"I said I'd stop, Jen,\" you retort, a mixture of fear and anger creeping into your voice.\n\n \n\n She stares at you for a moment, then nods and look to the floor. You hear a familiar rumbling. In disbelief, you brace yourself for what’s coming. Pent up magic in Jen bursts from within, flowing out over the apartment. You hear your own voice crying with anguish. Shattering bone and cracking muscle. You shield your eyes, and when you turn back Jennifer - the actual Jennifer - is sitting beside you.\n\n \n\n “How do you do that?” you whisper.\n\n \n\n Her green eyes gleam. “Magic, of course.”\n\n \n\n There is a chill to her words. You feel the power inside her, still churning.\n\n \n\n ”And what about us?” you ask. “Is that under watch too?”\n\n ”And what about our friendship?” you ask. “Is that under watch too?”\n \n\n “Let’s see,” she replies. “I’ve set my terms. If you stop using magic, maybe we can get past this. And if you don’t…” Another dark smile. “My offer always stands, . If you really want to see what’s underneath this town, you can do it as me. And I can spend time blissfully ignorant, as you.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n “I can’t,” you tell her. “There’s too much at stake, Jen. Too much to do with that school. And Emily. I need to stop it.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks up to you, her sad eyes hardening before you. She sighs. “Need to, or want to?”\n\n \n\n The tone of her voice strikes you as different. Resolved. Hard. Cold. You stare back at her.\n\n \n\n “I thought you’d say that,” she says, cracking her neck. “I wish you didn’t. But I knew you’d choose to continue. So let’s see how you like the shoe being on the other foot.”\n\n \n\n There is a slight rumble, but you can’t tell where it’s come from. Then, your mental senses are overloaded. Magical power builds inside Jennifer and before you can do a thing, she bursts like an explosion, radiating with magical energy. You hear her scream and shriek, bathed in amber light, and hear the cracking of bones.\n\n \n\n “No”, you whisper, but you feel paralyzed. Unable to turn away, watching through the light as Jennifer’s body shifts and reshapes. \n\n \n\n Then, with a final shriek, the magic fades. Silence fills the void again.

For the first time, you realise, she’s more powerful than you.\n\n \n\n “This is my offer,” Jennifer taunts you. “For today, I live as you. And you live my life. Go to work as me. See how the town treats the cast-off. Then come home and cook for… me. Well, you. Not knowing if you’re ever going to show up. And then, in the morning, we’ll see if you want to continue living out other people's lives.\"\n\n “This is my offer,” Jennifer taunts you. “For today, I live as you. And you live my life. Go to work as me. See how the town treats the cast-off. Then come home and throw a dinner party for us. Not knowing if you’re ever going show up. And then, after that, we’ll see if you want to continue living out other people's lives.\"\n \n\n “And if I don’t want this?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Then simple,” Jennifer says in your voice. “Tell me you’re giving up on magic. The choice is yours, . But based on how you've behaved as me, I'm betting you won't object.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n “Fine,” you say defeated. “I’ll spend the day as you.”\n\n \n\n She closes her eyes and inhales. When she opens them, they look sad. “Is solving the world’s problems really worth that much to you that you’ll give yourself up? Or, perhaps, you just enjoy it too much on the other side.”\n\n \n\n She looks to your chest, where the amulet rests beneath your top. Then back up to your face. “Get ready.” She waves a finger and you feel the amulet underneath your top tingle.\n\n \n\n Pain swears across your skin as the amulet erupts with energy. Crackles of magic energy lace up and down your arms, causing you to shriek as your body shifts and changes. This time, it’s raw and powerful. As if the amulet is struggling to remain in control of its own spell.\n\n \n\n You almost keel over, clutching your stomach as if ready to wretch. Shining brown hair falls over your eyes. You feel a set of heels pushing your feet up, whilst the room appears to grow larger.\n\n \n\n Your rib cage shifts and cracks as you feel your bones change, pulling your waist tight. Then, with a shriek, the anguish passes.\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath and look at your hands. You recognise them. Jennifer’s. \n\n \n\n And opposite you, is yourself. Grinning.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “Okay,” you whisper. “I’ll stop then.” \n\n \n\n Her eyes - your eyes - fixate on you, looking for duplicity. “Promise?”\n\n \n\n “Promise.”\n\n \n\n She nods and looks to the floor. You hear a familiar rumbling. In disbelief, you brace yourself for what’s coming. Pent up magic in Jen bursts from within, flowing out over the apartment. You hear your own voice crying with anguish. Shattering bone and cracking muscle. You shield your eyes, and when you turn back Jennifer - the actual Jennifer - is sitting beside you.\n\n \n\n “How do you do that?” you whisper.\n\n \n\n Her green eyes gleam. “Magic, of course.”\n\n \n\n After a moment, she reaches around her neck and pulls out something from her top. Resting around her neck on a piece of ribbon is an acorn. The acorn.\n\n \n\n “I’ve figured out how your trinket works now,” she says. “I've modified the charm. You’ll find that you can no longer transform into me. Ever. And I'm going to be watching. I’m going to make sure you stop going down this path you’re walking. Isn’t that what you taught me? To intervene when people need help?”\n\n \n\n There is a chill to her words. You feel the power inside her, still churning.\n\n \n\n ”And what about us?” you ask. “Is that under watch too?”\n\n ”And what about our friendship?” you ask. “Is that under watch too?”\n \n\n “Let’s see,” she replies. “I’ve set my terms. If you stop using magic, maybe we can get past this. And if you don’t…” Another dark smile. “My offer always stands, . If you really want to see what’s underneath this town, you can do it as me. And I can spend time blissfully ignorant, as you.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n “What -” you pause, hearing Jennifer’s voice come out of your mouth. Given your looking at yourself, this is again shocking to you.\n\n \n\n “What’s next?” she says, anticipating your question. “You’re running late for work. Go ahead and skip on to the department store. A day of stocking shelves, dealing with customers and putting up with complains awaits you. See how you still like living my life when it’s not planned holiday.”\n\n \n\n \n \n “What about me?” you say. “I have to make some money. Otherwise Emily and I will be evicted.”\n\n \n\n “Don’t worry about that,” you hear your voice tell… you. “I’ll get some cash for you today. You just worry about being a good little shop girl.”\n\n \n “What about me?” you say. “I have to go to work.”\n\n \n\n “Don’t worry about that,” you hear your voice tell… you. “I’ll go work your big important job today. I’m sure I can fake it 'till I make it. You just worry about being a good little shop girl.”\n \n \n \n\n “And then,” she continues. “Don’t forget to rush back to cook dinner. I may or may not come around. But you should prepare, anyway.”\n \n \n”Oh,” she adds. “Whilst you’re at the store, why don’t you buy something nice to wear. This evening. After dinner.” Her eye flicker to the bedroom door. “For in there. Who knows, if you play your cards right…” Your face grins as it pauses. “You might get lucky.”\n\n \n\n You struggle to process everything that’s happening to you. “Why are you doing this?” you stammer.\n\n \n\n “Because you need to see that there’s consequences for everything to do with magic,” she replies. “And if you really want to live a life seeped in it, then maybe I deserve one that you’re so eager to throw away.”\n\n \n\n She - he - stands. “Now run along,” she says. “I have to get ready. For my day.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “How was work?” you ask.\n\n \n\n \n \n “Good,” you hear yourself say. “I found a bit of work helping Ron Denver on his invoicing system. He’s really struggling with how to use his computer. Turns out that being you opens the door to people actually listening to your advice. I think I’m going to see if I can help him customise it to be more intuitive. It’s not exactly coding, but it will pay the bills. Speaking of.”\n\n \n\n You hear something hit the surface worktop. You glance over and see a stack of notes land.\n\n \n\n “That should help with your cash flow today,” you hear yourself comment, with a knowing smile.\n\n \n\n You stare at the money, considering how hard you’re finding it to make ends meet. And what you’re having to do.\n\n \n\n Or were you too busy pretending to be other people to consider you actually have some skills, after all?\n \n \n \n \n “Good,” you hear yourself say. “Office was busy. I had a little chat to Thompson first thing. Told him that I considered the errors of my ways. It took some persuading, but I told him that if he gave me one more shot he could dock my pay to minimum wage and I’d only get the rest if I performed. That, and a charm spell really helped seal the deal.”\n\n \n\n “You’re back working as a programmer?” you say, eyes wide.\n\n \n\n You see your doppelganger smile. “You didn’t think I’d go to all this effort to work as a secretary, did you?”\n\n \n\n Staring, your mouth drops open. “But… didn’t you think you should discuss it with me first?”\n\n \n\n A smile creeps up on their face. “Did you discuss it when you were acting as me, ?”\n \n\n You pause, then turn back to the kitchen top, feeling your cheeks redden. Why didn’t you think of negotiating with Thompson?\n\n \n\n Because you actually preferred being a receptionist, didn’t you?\n \n \n “Great!” you hear yourself say. “Office was busy. But got a lot done. Annie was actually nice to me. It’s amazing how much of difference losing all that baggage can make. I actually had lunch with her. She had a nice chat. She’s actually a lot of fun, isn’t she? I forgot how much. I didn't realise I missed her.”\n\n \n\n “You are to blame for a lot of that?” you can’t help but retort.\n\n \n\n “That’s all in the past,” you hear yourself say. “We toasted to new beginnings. I don’t think she had the same reason I did, but I’ll take a win for a win. And I also showed Thompson some of the changes I’d make to help the system. It was as if he finally got what I did. Complimented me on my performance.”\n\n \n\n You blush, turning back to dinner. In one day Jennifer seems to have made better progress at Thompsons' Repairs than you have in weeks.\n\n \n\n Maybe she’s just better at being you?\n \n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Did you check in on Emily?” you ask, as you check the timer.\n\n \n\n \n “I swung by,” you hear yourself say. “She trying to study. I sat with her for a bit, had a heart-to-heart on how she’s feeling.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes narrow. “Oh. And what did she say?”\n\n \n\n “Just how hard it is,” the reply comes. “The homework seemed hard. I gave her a few pointers on what to concentrate on. Not worry about the stuff she knows. Just concentrate on studying what doesn’t make sense.”\n\n \n\n You turn your head, looking at yourself. “How did she respond?”\n\n \n\n “She took it under advisement. She’s a good kid. Just got struggling on how to navigate Charlton’s weird subjects. But I gave her some pointers. I can’t stop the impact of the school, , but I can help her get through it. And she was really grateful too.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at yourself, lost for words. You thought your sister was lost to Charlton. But here’s Jennifer, doing a better job helping her than you.\n\n \n “I swung by the house,” you hear yourself say. “She was flicking through some fashion magazine. I sat with her for a bit, had a heart-to-heart on how she’s feeling.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes narrow. “Oh. And what did she say?”\n\n \n\n “Just how hard it is,” the reply comes. “I didn’t push her on homework. We just had a natter about things. She talks about boys. A lot. But I told her the best way to go about dealing with them without pandering to their every ask.”\n\n \n\n You turn your head, looking at yourself. “How did she respond?”\n\n \n\n “She took it under advisement. She’s a good kid. Just got caught up with Charlton’s nonsense. But I gave her some pointers. I can’t stop the impact of the school, , but I can help her get through it. And she was really grateful too.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at yourself, lost for words. You thought your sister was lost to Charlton. But here’s Jennifer, doing a better job helping her than you.\n\n \n \n\n Maybe this is the older Emily actually needs?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “Did you make any progress investigating the school?” you try.\n\n \n\n “I actually did,” you hear your voice say. “I chatted to Florence before work, when I got a coffee. Asked her if she knew who delivered the lunches to cafeteria. She said that sometimes they reach out to Fresh Pot for help”\n\n \n\n You spin around, thinking you’ve learned something important. “Fresh Pot provides the school lunches?”\n\n \n\n “Only when that lunch lady Jackie Thomas feels overstretched. Turns out, today was one of those days. Martin Dwell came in to pick it up, and… let’s just say he would have *magically* forgotten he had to do it by the time he left.”\n\n \n\n \n \n You narrow your eyes, as your brain races through what she's just said. Something jars within your brain. Then it clicks.\n\n \n\n \"But you're a guy!\" you exclaim. \"How did you use magic?\"\n\n \n\n The other you grins in response. \"That would be telling,\" you hear your voice say. Your old voice. \"Let's just say I'm not constrained by that amulet.\"\n\n \n\n You stare back, digesting what you've just heard. Something curdles in your stomach.\n\n \n You narrow your eyes, as your brain races through what she's just said. Something jars within your brain. But try as you might, you can't put a finger on what is wrong with that statement.\n\n \n\n They have enough magic to transform themselves, after all. Would using it on Martin really so much of a stretch?\n\n \n \n \n \n “Did that stop one of the curses?” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “Not beyond today,” comes a reply. “Still, not bad thinking.”\n\n \n\n You turn back, checking the cooking meat. Not willing to admit to yourself if she’s right. And she did it without needing to go to school as Emily, too.\n\n \n\n But you like going to school as Emily, don’t you?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “I've already dealt with the kitchen,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “I didn’t know that,” comes a reply. “Still, not bad thinking for just one day.”\n\n \n\n You turn back, checking the cooking meat. Not willing to admit to yourself if she’s right. And she did it without needing to go to school as Emily, too. \n\n \n\n But you like going to school as Emily, don’t you?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You move on to the table, laying out place mats and cutlery in preparation. Your doppelganger takes a seat, smiling. “Smells delicious,” they say.\n\n \n\n Returning to the kitchen, you dish up the meal on two plates. Steam and scents of a home-cooked meal fill your nostrils. You wonder why you don’t cook like this at home.\n\n \n\n You return to the table with the plates and take a seat, realising you're still wearing the kitchen apron. Your doppelganger’s eyes look down at it, but say nothing.\n\n \n\n You watch them take a bite. A smile forms on their face. “It tastes great. My compliments to the chef.”\n\n \n\n There is a flutter inside you as the compliment lands. You begin to pick at your own food, finding yourself not that hungry after cooking.\n\n \n\n Throughout the meal, you make small talk. You ask more about the day, which proceeds into a lengthy monologue about every detail that happened. When it comes to your turn to tell, you find yourself coming up short. The mundane duties of Jennifer’s life feel empty in comparison.\n\n \n\n You continue talking long after you both have finished your meals, her making jokes about the inhabitants of the town. Before long, you realise time has ticked away.\n\n \n\n \n “This has been fun,” Jennifer finally says. “Not just this,” she gestures to the finished meal. “But the whole thing.”\n\n \n\n She pauses, her face slipping into something more menacing. The meal, you realise, has just been a performance.\n\n \n\n “All good things have to come to an end, though\" she adds. \"I have to admit, though. I think I do a better job of being you than you do. If you want me to continue, just come by any morning. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\"\n\n \n\n You stare back at yourself. Your old self. The troubling thought of how far Jennifer will go if you continue plagues you.\n\n \n\n And wouldn't you just rather be her, instead?\n\n \n\n \"Goodnight, Jen,\" she tells you. \"Don't worry, I'm staying inside tonight. I won't get up to mischief as you.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You smile. \"I should get going.\"\n\n \n\n There’s a glint in her eye. “But don’t you live here? Shouldn’t I be the one going?”\n\n \n\n There’s humour laced in the words, but not enough for you to feel safe. “Jen,” you begin. “I think this has gone on long enough.”\n\n \n\n “Or,” she replies. “Why don’t you stay?” she flicks her eyes to the bedroom. “There’s actually one thing left that I haven’t done today that I’ve been dying to do.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n “Alright,” you say with nervousness. “I’ll stay.”\n\n \n\n \n \n Jennifer, in your form, smiles. “Did you buy something special?”\n\n \n\n You nod.\n \n \n\n \n Jennifer instinctively giggles, but it comes out differently in your body. It almost surprised her, but she quickly regains her composure. “Alright, why don’t you go and freshen up. I’ll stack the dish washer?”\n\n \n\n You stare at her for a second, then nod and walk towards the bedroom. It looks like you’re really going through with this. After all you’ve done, this makes your mind shatter with each step towards the bedroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I really need to go,” you tell her, standing.\n\n \n\n “Such a shame,” Jennifer says, chuckling in your voice. She pauses, her face slipping into something more menacing. The meal, you realise, has just been a performance.\n\n \n\n “All good things have to come to an end, though\" she adds. \"I have to admit, though. I think I do a better job of being you than you do. If you want me to continue, just come by any morning. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\"\n\n \n\n You stare back at yourself. Your old self. The troubling thought of how far Jennifer will go if you continue plagues you.\n\n \n\n And wouldn't you just rather be her, instead?\n\n \n\n \"Goodnight, Jen,\" she tells you. \"Don't worry, I'm staying inside tonight. I won't get up to mischief as you.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You take a deep breath, then nod. A grin forms on the other’s face. They reach out and pull you from the back, their hands on the back of your hand as they push you down to the floor. You kneel at their feet, staring up at them, their groin perilously close to your face.\n\n \n \n You stare at it for a moment. Remembering what it felt like when Jennifer was in this position. When it was you standing. When her dainty hands wrapped around your shaft.\n\n \n\n Slowly, you reach forward and unbuckle the belt. There is no ambiguity now. They are . And you are Jennifer. As you pull the trousers down just enough to see the boxer shorts, the reality of the situation is clear. With a quick flick, you pull them down.\n\n \n\n \n It springs out almost into her face. Whether due to being in this smaller body or just seeing it from a different perspective, you feel your eyes widen at the sight of how big it is. You trace one of your coloured nails across it, nerves fluttering within you.\n\n \n\n “Suck it,” they command.\n\n \n\n You nod and move your face forward, running your tongue over the tip. It feels warm against your touch. Then, cautiously, you know what you must do. You wrap your lips around it and tease the end with your mouth. ** sighs in euphoria.\n\n \n\n Using your dainty hand, you feed the cock into your tiny mouth, taking more and more of its length inside. You glance up, watching ** stares down at you from above, watching you begin to bob up and down, taking his prick deeper between your glossy lips and towards your throat.\n\n \n\n “You're so good at this,” they whisper, reaching out to pull your head further towards their body. You force yourself to relax as they push your face down on to his groin, cock hitting the back of your throat and brushing your tonsils. You feel your gag reflex kick in, but you hold still, fighting it off, instead staring upwards locking with their eyes until they release you. \n\n \n\n You gasp for air, but then look back up at them. At you. You know what they want. You smile.\n\n \n It springs out. Whether due to being in this smaller body or just seeing it from a different perspective, it seems bigger than you gave yourself credit for. You trace one of your coloured nails across it, anticipation fluttering within you.\n\n \n\n “Suck it,” they tell you.\n\n \n\n You nod and move your face forward, running your tongue over the tip. It feels warm against your touch. Then, cautiously, you know what you must do. You wrap your lips around it and tease the end with your mouth. ** sighs in euphoria.\n\n \n\n Using your dainty hand, you feed the cock into your tiny mouth, taking more and more of its length inside. You glance up, watching ** stares down at you from above, watching you begin to bob up and down, taking his prick deeper between your glossy lips and towards your throat.\n\n \n\n “You're so good at this,” they whisper, reaching out to pull your head further towards their body. You force yourself to relax as he pushes your face down on to their groin, cock hitting the back of your throat. You hold still, fighting off an instinct to gag, instead staring upwards locking with their eyes until they release you. \n\n \n\n You gasp for air, but then look back up at them. At you. You know what they want. You smile.\n \n \n It falls out in front of your lips. You look at it hesitantly. Maybe it’s just this new angle, but you thought it would look bigger. You hold it in your hand, coloured nails wrapped enclosed around it, feeling something akin to disappointment in spite of how bizarre every emotion you’re having feels to you.\n\n \n\n “Can you suck it?” ** asks.\n\n \n\n You nod and move your face forward, running your tongue over it. It feels warm against your touch. Then, cautiously, you know what you must do. You wrap your lips around it and tease the end with your mouth. ** sighs in euphoria.\n\n \n\n Using your dainty hand, you feed the cock into your tiny mouth, quickly taking its length inside. You glance up, watching ** stare down at you from above, watching you engulf the dick between your glossy lips in only a few movements.\n\n \n\n “You're so good at this,” they whisper, reaching out to pull your head further towards their body. You relax as they push your face down on to his groin, cock filling your mouth but nothing more. You lock your eyes with their's until they release you. \n\n \n\n You take a deep breath, still looking up at him. At you. You know what he wants. You smile.\n \n \n It falls out in front of your lips. You look at it with confusion. It might just be this new view, but it looks tiny. You hold it between two coloured nails and despite how everything feels bizarre to you, one thing feels certain. You’re disappointed.\n\n \n\n “Do you think you can suck it?” ** asks.\n\n \n\n You feel an eyebrow rise instinctively, but you nod and move your face forward, running your tongue over it. It feels warm against your touch. Then, cautiously, you know what you must do. You feed it whole between your lips. ** sighs in euphoria.\n\n \n\n There’s no need for your hands. You feel almost empty as you flick your tongue around the tiny penis inside your mouth. You glance up, watching ** stare down at you from above, watching you gurgle the dick inside you and between your glossy lips.\n\n \n\n “You're so good at this,” they whisper, reaching out to pull your head further towards their body. It makes no difference. Your lips already brush against his pubic hair. It doesn’t even touch the back of your mouth. You lock your eyes with their's until they release you. \n\n \n \n You look up at them. At you. You know what they want. You smile.\n \n \n \n\n “I think you’re ready,” you say after regaining your breath. You stand up, lean back towards the bed, and shift up on to it. A wave of anticipation surges within you. You part your legs as you lies down on your back.\n\n \n\n ** at the foot of the bed grins and climbs on to the bed, pulling their trousers down as they do so. Straddling you, they take their top off and cast it aside.\n \n \n \n \nThe sight is enough to momentarily bring you to your senses. You aren't a virgin. Not technically. But it's getting so hard to keep track of what you are. One thing you know, this will be the first time you've had sex as a woman. Do you really want to lose your, for lack of a better term, virginity again, as Jennifer?\n\n \n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n “Do you think…” you murmur, “Don’t you want to… taste me?” Your eyes flicker down your body, gazing on the hem of your lingerie. Then back up, meeting their gaze.\n\n \n\n ** smiles and nods. Slowly, you hoist yourself further on the bed and lie down, parting your legs and lifting the hemline of your slip, revealing your shaved, hairless pussy.\n\n \n\n “I’ve never done this before,” ** says. \n\n \n\n They drop to her knees, lining eyes up with yours. Then lean forward, eagerly moving their lips towards yours. You look down your body, still holding up your hem, watching their head move towards your pussy.\n\n \n\n Their tongue laps at her labia, around the edges, across and upward. Bolts of pleasure emanate upwards, causing you to moan as the tongue runs across your hole. You feel yourself stirring in your loins. Growing wet. With a sigh, you arch your head back, close your eyes and shudder as the tongue explores the edges of your lips.\n\n \n\n Then, ** slips their tongue inside of you.\n\n \n\n Your legs instinctively close around them as you moan. ** continues to lap at you, tongue pushing deeper and deeper inside, licking at your juices as they begin to flow. You squeak with pleasure.\n\n \n\n You open your eyes, hairless legs wrapped around your old head that's buried in your groin. Your body shivers and you can barely reach down to brush their hair, panting.\n\n \n\n ** glances up, as if curious if she’s doing something wrong. You smile. “I think I’m ready,” you hear yourself say. Hear Jennifer say. But it’s your decision. It’s you.\n\n \n\n To emphasise, you pull yourself further back up on the bed, parting your legs even more. ** grins and climbs on to the bed, pulling their trousers down as they do so. Straddling you, they take their top off and cast it aside.\n\n \n \n \nThe sight is enough to momentarily bring you to your senses. You aren't a virgin. Not technically.

Then back up, meeting their gaze.\n\n \n\n ** smiles, but their head shakes. \"You're going to give me a blowjob, **.” To emphasise, they cup their balls. “Get on your knees.”\n\n \n\n They reach out and pull you forwards, hands on the back of your hand as they push you down to the floor. You kneel at their feet, staring up at them, their groin perilously close to your face.\n\n \n\n You stare at it for a moment. Remembering what it felt like when Jennifer was in this position.

Do you really want to lose your, for lack of a better term, virginity again, as Jennifer?\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \"Stop,\" you hear yourself murmur. A small, meek voice, a plea, but it's enough to make the man on top of you stop. His eyes look down on you with concern. His erect member hovering over your exposed pussy, sticking out over your stomach like a weapon.\n\n \n\n \"What?\" ** says. \n\n \n\n Biting down into your bottom lip, you feel yourself blushing. \"I just... it's just too much too soon, you murmur. Taking a deep breath, you shrug your shoulders lightly. \"Like this, I'm sort of a virgin.\"\n\n \n\n ** takes in a deep breath, his pants audible in the silence. Their eyes lock on to you briefly, before looking down. At his cock, hovering near your hole. You can see the calculation in his eyes. \n\n \n\n \"A bit late to be turning into a tease, isn't it?\" he finally says with a smirk. \n\n \n\n \"I'm sorry,\" you stammer, trying to return his smile.\n\n \n\n looks down at you, eyes lingering on your body. \"I'm still really horny,\" they murmur. \"Never used to be into girls. But like this. It feels different.\"\n\n \n\n \"Do you want to finish yourself off?\" you hear yourself saying. As if answering his confusion, you reach down and pull your negligee up, exposing your pert breasts. Jennifer's breasts.\n\n \n\n *Or are they yours now?*\n\n \n\n It's enough to make the smile broaden. Slowly, they reach down and begin to stroke their penis. Faster and faster, as you hold your sleepwear up around your neck, posing for his pleasure.\n\n \n\n ** groans and whimpers, as his hand frenziedly moves back and forth. “I’m going to cum,” he cries. “I’m going to paint your face!”\n\n \n\n \n ** clambers up over your torso, legs astride your chest. He strokes his cock quickly, aiming it towards your face. You couldn’t move away now, even if you wanted to.\n\n \n\n With an audible grunt, for a split second you see his prick erupt. And then something hits your face. Large globs of liquid splatter over your eyes. Then your lips. You feel it even land in your hair.\n\n \n\n It seems to be never-ending. You just wince as spurts of semen paint your skin. You close your eyes instinctively, feeling the warm liquid running across your pores. \n\n \n\n Only when certain it’s stopped do you dare to open them again. You feel the substance sticking against your eyelids as you try to blink it away. ** stares down at you, cock in hand, smiling. \n\n \n\n “That was a lot,” you murmur.\n\n \n\n He sniggers. “Run your tongue around your lips.”\n\n \n\n You frown, but do as he says. Instantly aware of the salty taste on your lips. Your mouth is covered in cum. \n\n \n\n “You look like such a slut,” ** tells you.\n\n \n ** clambers up over your torso, legs astride your chest. He strokes his cock quickly, aiming it towards your face. You couldn’t move away now, even if you wanted to.\n\n \n\n With an audible grunt, for a split second you see his prick erupt. Something hits your face and you feel large globs of liquid splatter over your forehead. Then your lips. Then a jet hits your eyes.\n\n \n\n Instinctively you close them, feeling the warm liquid running across your pores. Only when certain it’s stopped do you open them. You feel the substance sticking against your eyelids as you try to blink it away. ** stares down at you, cock in hand, smiling. \n\n \n\n “Been a while, has it?” ** asks with a smirk. “Run your tongue around your lips.”\n\n \n\n You frown, but do as he says. Instantly aware of the salty taste on your lips. Your lips are coated with cum. \n\n \n ** clambers up over your torso, legs astride your chest. He strokes his cock quickly, aiming it towards your face. You couldn’t move away now, even if you wanted to.\n\n \n\n With an audible grunt, for a split second you see his prick erupt. Something hits your face and you feel large globs of liquid splatter over your forehead. Then your lips. \n\n \n\n And then… nothing. You wait, still braced for more. But then you see a trickle run out of the tip, dripping down over your neck. He’s done. ** stares down at his dick, confused.\n\n \n\n “Are you done?” you ask him, a hint of softness in your voice. He looks up at you, nods, and gestures to around his mouth. \n\n \n\n Instinctively you run your tongue around your lips, tasting the salty taste upon them. At least your lips are splattered with cum. \n\n \n ** clambers up over your torso, legs astride your chest. He strokes his cock quickly, aiming it towards your face. You couldn’t move away now, even if you wanted to.\n\n \n\n With an audible grunt, for a split second you see his prick erupt. Something hits your lips and you brace yourself for his ejaculation.\n\n \n\n But then… nothing. You wait, still ready for more. But then you see a trickle run out of the tip, dripping down over your neck. He’s done. ** stares down at his dick, confused.\n\n \n\n “Is that it?” you ask him, a hint of sadness in your voice. He looks up at you, nods, and gestures to around his mouth. \n\n \n\n Instinctively you run your tongue around your lips, tasting the salty taste upon them. At least your lips are splattered with cum.\n\n \n \n\n You smile politely as he shifts himself off your body and off to the side. You look around, eyes spotting the tissues on the bedside table.\n\n \n\n “No,” ** says as you reach out for one. “Go to the bathroom. I want you to see yourself like this. See how it feels.”\n\n \n\n Again, you wordlessly nod. You shift yourself off the bed and with a final glance back at his dick, you head towards Jennifer’s bathroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You look up at the man between you, your legs either side of him, feeling your thighs touching his skin. Your eyes linger on his chest, then drift down to the large erect member, hovering over your exposed pussy, sticking out over your stomach like a weapon. Everything this evening, you realise, has been leading up to this. And you can’t deny it any longer. You’ve wanted it all. “Fuck me,” you whisper, breathlessly.\n\n \n\n Without needing more assurance, he reaches down and guides his prick towards you. His fingers rub over your clit, massaging it for a moment, then cautiously drives his dick inside you.\n \n \n \nYou wince as you feel for the first time a cock pushing up inside your body. You know there will be no blood, no hymen to break. But the sensation is alien all the same, as your tender cavities stretch and rub against the foreign body now invading you. Something fleeting flashes across your mind. Not words, not a feeling, but more of an acknowledgement. Of what you've done. What you've let happen. You wonder if it's possible to turn back now.\n\n \n \n A flurry of endorphins flood your body, causing you to moan as its girth stretches you wide. He rocks back and forth, slowly pushing his dick further and further inside you. Spasms of pleasure flash up from within, driving you to whimper as he crashes against you. \n\n \n\n You arch your back, grinding against him, taking him further and further inside your skin. You catch his eyes and he grins, reaching out to pull your negligee down. You feel the cold air on your exposed breasts as he squeezes your nipples. You whimper at his touch.\n\n \n\n As your body shakes, you clasp your legs against his torso, wrapping around his body as you lay otherwise inert underneath him. You can’t help but bite your bottom lip, struggling to contain the screams of pleasure that come from your throat.\n\n \n\n And then, you feel it building. A radiating and ever-growing bubble within you. All the sensations and endorphins fusing together, greater than the sum of their parts, pushing up with a greater force than you can remember feeling. A little like magic, you momentarily consider.\n\n \n\n “Oh god!” you hear yourself murmurs, then arch your back and push your body against his. The shriek is loud, uncontrolled and unashamed.\n\n \n\n ** hammers hard, groaning himself. “I’m going to cum,” he cries. “I’m going to paint your face!”\n\n \n\n As you ride the residual wave of your orgasm, you glance up at him. He’s moments away from finishing himself. You have one chance to tell him what to do.\n\n \n You look up at the man between you, legs either side of him, feeling your thighs touching his skin. Your eyes linger on his chest, then drift down to the erect member, hovering over your exposed pussy, sticking out over your stomach. Everything this evening, you realise, has been leading up to this. And you can’t deny it any longer.

You catch his eyes and he grins, reaching out to pull your negligee down. You feel the cold air on your exposed breasts as he squeezes your nipples. You whimper at his touch.\n\n \n\n As your body shakes, you part your legs further, giving him room to pound against you, slapping his balls against your skin. You can’t help but bite your bottom lip, struggling to contain the screams of pleasure that come from your throat.\n\n \n\n And then, you feel it building. A radiating and ever-growing bubble within you. All the sensations and endorphins fusing together, greater than the sum of their parts, pushing up with a greater force than you can remember feeling.

He’s moments away from finishing himself. You have one chance to tell him what to do.\n \n \n You look up at the man between you, legs either side of him, feeling your thighs touching his skin. Your eyes linger on his chest, noting the small mounds and his nipples that appear to have grown erect. Something feels off…\n\n \n\n But your eyes drift down to his small cock, hovering over your exposed pussy. Everything this evening, you realise, has been leading up to this. And you can’t deny it any longer. You’ve wanted it all. “Fuck me,” you murmur. And you murmur as he enters, his full dick inside you sooner than expected.\n \n \n \nYou wince as you feel for the first time a cock pushing up inside your body. You know there will be no blood, no hymen to break. But the sensation is alien all the same, as your tender cavities stretch and rub against the foreign body now invading you. Something fleeting flashes across your mind. Not words, not a feeling, but more of an acknowledgement. Of what you've done. What you've let happen. You wonder if it's possible to turn back now.\n\n \n \n\n Still, you feel it rubbing inside your womb and against your clit, triggering endorphins to rush into your bloodstream. You arch your back, grinding against him. You catch his eyes and he grins, reaching out to pull your negligee down. You feel the cold air on your exposed breasts as he squeezes your nipples. \n\n \n\n As he pushes forward, you pull your legs back with your hands, pulling your knees almost up to your chin, in an effort to get him deeper within you. You catch 's gaze as you lie inert for him, legs raised high for his access.\n\n \n\n ** hammers hard, groaning himself. “I’m going to cum,” he cries. “I’m going to paint your face!”\n\n \n\n Far from an orgasm of your own, you glance up at him. He’s moments away from finishing himself. You have one chance to tell him what to do.\n\n \n You look up at the man between you, legs either side of him, feeling your thighs touching his skin. Your eyes linger on his chest, noting his small breasts. This feels wrong…\n\n \n\n But your eyes drift down to his tiny prick, hovering over your exposed pussy. Everything this evening, you realise, has been leading up to this. And you can’t deny it any longer. You’ve wanted it all. Even if this isn’t exactly how you pictured it. “Fuck me,” you say flatly. You murmur as his enters, his dick barely registering inside of you. \n\n \n \nYou wince as you feel for the first time a cock pushing up inside your body. You know there will be no blood, no hymen to break. But the sensation is alien all the same, as your tender cavities stretch and rub against the foreign body now invading you. Something fleeting flashes across your mind. Not words, not a feeling, but more of an acknowledgement. Of what you've done. What you've let happen. You wonder if it's possible to turn back now.\n\n \n \n\n Still, you feel it rubbing against your clit, triggering endorphins to rush into your bloodstream. You arch your back, grinding against him. You catch his eyes and he grins, reaching out to pull your negligee down. You feel the cold air on your exposed breasts as he squeezes your nipples. \n\n \n\n As he pushes forward, you pull your legs back with your hands, pulling your knees almost up to your chin, in an effort to get him deeper within you. You catch 's gaze as you lie inert for him, legs raised high for his access.\n\n \n\n ** hammers hard, groaning himself. “I’m going to cum,” he cries. “I’m going to paint your face!”\n\n \n\n Far from an orgasm of your own, you glance up at him. He’s moments away from finishing himself. You have one chance to tell him what to do.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You feel ** pull his dick from out of you and he clambers up over your torso, legs astride your chest. He strokes his cock quickly, aiming it towards your face. You couldn’t move away now, even if you wanted to.\n\n \n\n With an audible grunt, for a split second you see his prick erupt. And then something hits your face. Large globs of liquid splatter over your eyes. Then your lips. You feel it even land in your hair.\n\n \n\n It seems to be never-ending. You just wince as spurts of semen paint your skin. You close your eyes instinctively, feeling the warm liquid running across your pores. \n\n \n\n Only when certain it’s stopped do you dare to open them again. You feel the substance sticking against your eyelids as you try to blink it away. ** stares down at you, cock in hand, smiling. \n\n \n\n “That was a lot,” you murmur.\n\n \n\n He sniggers. “Run your tongue around your lips.”\n\n \n\n You frown, but do as he says. Instantly aware of the salty taste on your lips. Your mouth is covered in cum. \n\n \n\n “You look like such a slut,” ** tells you.\n\n \n You feel ** pull his dick from out of you and he clambers up over your torso, legs astride your chest. He strokes his cock quickly, aiming it towards your face. You couldn’t move away now, even if you wanted to.\n\n \n\n With an audible grunt, for a split second you see his prick erupt. Something hits your face and you feel large globs of liquid splatter over your forehead. Then your lips. Then a jet hits your eyes.\n\n \n\n Instinctively you close them, feeling the warm liquid running across your pores. Only when certain it’s stopped do you open them. You feel the substance sticking against your eyelids as you try to blink it away. ** stares down at you, cock in hand, smiling. \n\n \n\n “Been a while, has it?” ** asks with a smirk. “Run your tongue around your lips.”\n\n \n\n You frown, but do as he says. Instantly aware of the salty taste on your lips. Your lips are coated with cum. \n\n \n You feel ** pull his dick from out of you and he clambers up over your torso, legs astride your chest. He strokes his cock quickly, aiming it towards your face. You couldn’t move away now, even if you wanted to.\n\n \n\n With an audible grunt, for a split second you see his prick erupt. Something hits your face and you feel large globs of liquid splatter over your forehead. Then your lips. \n\n \n\n And then… nothing. You wait, still braced for more. But then you see a trickle run out of the tip, dripping down over your neck. He’s done. ** stares down at his dick, confused.\n\n \n\n “Are you done?” you ask him, a hint of softness in your voice. He looks up at you, nods, and gestures to around his mouth. \n\n \n\n Instinctively you run your tongue around your lips, tasting the salty taste upon them. At least your lips are splattered with cum. \n\n \n You feel ** pull his dick from out of you and he clambers up over your torso, legs astride your chest. He strokes his cock quickly, aiming it towards your face. You couldn’t move away now, even if you wanted to.\n\n \n\n With an audible grunt, for a split second you see his prick erupt.

But then you see a trickle run out of the tip, dripping down over your neck. He’s done. ** stares down at his dick, confused.\n\n \n\n “Is that it?” you ask him, a hint of sadness in your voice. He looks up at you, nods, and gestures to around his mouth. \n\n \n\n Instinctively you run your tongue around your lips, tasting the salty taste upon them. At least your lips are splattered with cum.\n\n \n \n\n You smile politely as he shifts himself off your body and off to the side. You look around, eyes spotting the tissues on the bedside table.\n\n \n\n “No,” ** says as you reach out for one. “Go to the bathroom. I want you to see yourself like this. See how it feels.”\n\n \n\n Again, you wordlessly nod. You shift yourself off the bed and with a final glance back at his dick, you head towards Jennifer’s bathroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Just pull out,” you stammer.\n\n \n\n You see the flash of irritation on *'s* face, but he pulls his dick out of you and points it over your body, massaging it vigorously. Knowing what will happen, you pull your slip up from your stomach. \n\n \n\n \n Just in time as jets of sticky white semen splatter your torso. One spurt. Two. A third. He tugs at his dick one final time and a cum arches through the air across you.\n\n \n\n By the time his sighs in elation, your stomach is covered in your spunk. You feel its sticky texture run across your body. You look up at him, smiling politely. “That was a lot.”\n\n \n\n He pulls himself off you, grinning. “You look like such a slut,” he says, almost in a tone of affection.\n\n \n Just in time as jets of sticky white semen splatter your torso. One spurt. Then another. He tugs at his dick one final time and a cum arches through the air across you.\n\n \n\n By the time his sighs in elation, your stomach is splattered with cum. You feel its sticky texture run across your body. You look up at him, smiling politely. \n\n \n\n He pulls himself off you, grinning. “Been a while, has it?” he asks.\n\n \n Just in time as a jet of sticky white semen splatter your torso. He tugs at his dick one final time and cum arches through the air across your body.\n\n \n\n Glancing down, you see two threads of spunk across you. You feel its sticky texture run across your body. You look up at him, a little unsure if that’s it. He himself looks confused.\n\n \n Just in time as a small stream of sticky white semen land on your stomach. Glancing down, you see a thread of spunk across you. You feel its sticky texture settling in your bellybutton. You look up at him, a little unsure if that’s it. He himself looks confused.\n\n \n \n\n You look around, eyes spotting the tissues on the bedside table.\n\n \n\n “No,” ** says as you reach out for one. “Go to the bathroom. I want you to see yourself like this. See how it feels.”\n\n \n\n Again, you wordlessly nod. You shift yourself off the bed and with a final glance back at his dick, you head towards Jennifer’s bathroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n The words escape your mouth before you can stop them. “Cum inside me.”\n\n \n\n You see the surprise on *'s* face, he shallowly nods. With a moan, you feel his thrusting increase and then all too quickly he cries. “I'm cumming!”\n\n \n\n You feel his large dick empty deep inside your womb. One spurt. Two. A third. Ecstasy apparent on his face. By the time he’s finished, he collapses forward, lying against your body.\n\n You feel his dick empty deep inside your womb. One spurt. Then another. By the time he’s finished, he collapses forward, lying against your body.\n\n You feel his small dick empty deep inside your womb. Just a spurt, then he collapses forward, lying against your body.\n\n You feel his tiny dick empty deep inside your womb. So meager you can’t even feel it. He collapses forward, lying against your body.\n\n \n \n\n “Oh god,” he murmurs. “I didn’t think you’d risk that.”\n\n \n\n “You’re still on the pill, aren’t you?” you ask him. A sinking feeling inside your stomach. Does that even mean that you are? From the look in his eyes, he doesn’t know the answer either.\n\n \n\n He sighs and rolls off you, staring back. Finally an understanding smile forms. “Just be careful in future,” he says. “Doctor Palmer… let’s just say his birth control prescriptions are prone to accidents.”\n\n \n\n You nod, wondering how that might happen. \n\n \n\n And what that means for you, surely?\n\n \n\n Trying to move on from the thought, you look around, eyes spotting the tissues on the bedside table.\n\n \n\n “No,” ** says as you reach out for one. “Go to the bathroom. I want you to see yourself like this. See how it feels.”\n\n \n\n Again, you wordlessly nod. You shift yourself off the bed and with a final glance back at his dick, you head towards Jennifer’s bathroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n **Jennifer's Apartment - Bathroom**\n\n [image: ./images/Jennifers_Apartment_Bathroom.png]\n\n \n\n You slip into the bathroom, flicking on the light. There, surrounded by face cleansers and pastel coloured hair products, is bathroom mirror. Right now, the reflection is Jennifer. You.\n\n \n\n You take in the sight, almost shocked. Your face is covered in spunk. You’ve only seen such a sight in bukkake porn. Your hair is matted together from the semen. Your eyelashes glisten with it. Your eye shadow is smudged and your lip gloss smeared. Meanwhile, your nightie is tugged down and ruffled, nipples partially still hanging out from the delicate lingerie you’re wearing.\n\n You take in the sight. Your face is coated in spunk. It’s not quite like bukkake, but not far off. Cum runs down your face. Your eyelashes glisten from it. Your eye shadow is smudged and your lip gloss smeared. Meanwhile, your nightie is tugged down and ruffled, nipples partially still hanging out of the delicate lingerie you’re wearing.\n\n You take in the sight. Your face and lips are sprayed with semen. You look a girl at the end of an porno where her partner guy done one too many shoots that day. Still, it’s visible and apparent. Cum runs down your nose. Your lip gloss is smeared and glistens from the semen. And your nightie is tugged down and ruffled, nipples partially still hanging out of the delicate lingerie you’re wearing.\n\n You take in the sight. Your lips are peppered with cum. It looks as though someone came inside your mouth and you couldn’t swallow. Your lip gloss is smeared and your nightie is tugged down and ruffled, nipples partially still hanging out of the delicate lingerie you’re wearing.\n\n \n \n\n For a moment you can only stare. Whilst it looks like Jennifer, you can’t recall her ever appearing so… meek. You try to think back on all the times you’ve had sex. Neither of you have experimented with dominance and submission, but she’s never ended up looking like this.\n\n \n\n *This isn’t Jennifer, though, is it? This is you.*\n\n \n\n You gulp and reach out for some paper. You spend a few minutes freshening yourself up and removing the ruined make-up, then return to the bedroom.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n **Jennifer's Apartment - Bathroom**\n\n [image: ./images/Jennifers_Apartment_Bathroom.png]\n\n \n\n You slip into the bathroom, flicking on the light.

They smile, content, then slip out of the bedroom door.\n\n \n\n You feel the sensation of air against your bare legs, feeling conscious of the length of your slip. You slide into the bed, feeling the sheets warming you as you get in. \n\n \n\n ** returns minutes later, their masculine form sliding in beside you. They wrap your arms around your body, feeling your close. \n\n \n\n \n You feel yourself push back against their manly torso, feeling secure spooned in their arms. “That was… intense,” you murmur.\n\n \n\n “Shssshh,” you hear them say. “We can talk more in the morning. Goodnight, lover.” she purrs.\n \n \n You feel yourself push back against their torso, feeling your silk nightie rub against their nipples. “That was different.” you murmur.\n\n \n\n “Shssshh,” you hear them say. “We can talk more in the morning. Goodnight.” she purrs.\n \n \n You feel yourself push back against their torso, feeling your silk nightie rub against their chest. “Are you alright?” you murmur.\n\n \n\n “Shssshh,” you hear them say. “We can talk more in the morning. Night.” she says hesitantly. \n \n \n You feel yourself push back against their torso, feeling your silk nightie rub against their breasts. “Are you alright?” you murmur.\n\n \n\n “We can talk more in the morning. Night.” they say hesitantly. \n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \"I suppose I could do another day,\" you tell her.\n\n \n\n A beaming smile spreads across her face. \"Great!\" she says, only now trying to hide her excitement. \"Here we go again.\"\n\n \n\n The rumble begins once more, this time you know what is causing it. You feel the magic building inside Jennifer and brace yourself. It bursts from her body, warming your skin. You hear her shriek, as your ears are filled with the cracking of bones.\n\n \n\n Then, with a final scream, the magic fades. Silence fills the void again. And you find yourself staring back... at you.\n\n \n\n Jennifer - you - chuckles. \"That was a bit easier this time. Is that how it feels to you, ?\"\n\n \n\n You stare back at her, as she runs her manly hands down her body. She grins.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Jennifer’s is third from the right. The lock is already loose, so you ease the door open. Inside is a spare uniform, a stack of receipts held with a bulldog clip, and a familiar biology textbook. Worn, annotated and identical to Terrence’s.\n\n \n\n You lift the book gently and open it. Two things fall out straight away.\n\n \n \n First: a faded photograph. Glossy, curled at the corners. Two girls, no more than ten, kneeling in a sunlit field. Their knees are scraped, their hands muddy, and one is steadying the other with a half-smile, half-laugh. You pause. The blonde hair. The dark curls. The faces are younger and softer, are unmistakable. Jennifer. And Annie.\n\n \n\n The second item: a torn piece of paper. Evans’ Department Store note stock, just like the one in Terrence’s locker. Watermarked. The handwriting matches the note from Terrence's locker.\n\n \n\n Thanks for your help! Sunday mornings. 01434 457045.\n\n \n\n The number tugs at your memory. You’ve dialed it recently. It’s the landlord for the Handle household.\n\n \n\n So Jennifer’s been tutoring him. Quietly. Off the record. And she’s kept it to herself. And someone here at Evans Department Store knows where and why. Even stranger is the photo of Annie and Jennifer. And why she's got that inside this book.\n\n \n\n You tuck the note and photograph back where they were and slide the exercise book back into place. Then, quietly, you shut the locker. You’ll need to follow up. Whatever Jennifer’s doing, it isn’t just about grades.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Do you mean to tell me she's been fraternising with guests?\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"I just asked her a question about it.\"\n\n \n\n Lennox tuts, but returns his stare to you. His eyes drift over your body. A thin smile passes across his lips. \"Well. Regardless of how you discovered it, we do have a vacancy. Are you over eighteen?\"\n\n \n\n You nod. \"Just finishing my final year at Charlton.\"\n\n \n\n A thin smile passes across his lips. \"I'm sure you are an exemplary student.\"\n\n \n\n \"We need a cleaning assistant to help Miss. Cinders. Lord knows she needs the help. We wouldn't want to jeopardise your studies, but if you're willing to work weekends and late nights, there may be a role for you here.\"\n\n \n\n You nod. \"How do I apply?\"\n\n \n\n He looks at you, his eyes cautiously wandering over your face. \"No time like the present. Do you have some time free now? I think we should have a little chat. To assess your suitability for the role.\"\n\n \n\n The question is, do you really need to do this? Is access to the hotel really worth that much to you? Or are you that strapped for cash?\n\n \n\n *Because you wouldn't have any other reasons for applying for a maid job, would you?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \"I saw the advert in the Charlton Gazette,\" you tell him. \"I was wondering if you had more details.\"\n\n \n\n Lennox's eyes drift over your body.

There is a hint of a wince. \"Are you sure that customer service is something suited to you?\"\n\n \n\n You nod. \"I'm sure I will manage.\"\n\n \n\n A thin smile plays across his lips. \"Just managing isn't what we expect at the Charlton Hotel. Our staff are expected to exceed our expectations. And their own.\"\n\n \n\n You wince at the slip. \"I assure you, I'm a hard worker.\"\n\n \n\n \"That may be the case,\" Lennox says. \"But I'm afraid that someone of your reputation isn't suitable for our establishment. If you struggle to fulfil the duties of a secretary, I have no doubt you lack what we're looking for.\"\n\n \n\n Lennox's eyes meet yours. The icy stare makes you grow colder. You accept his judgement without a word and quietly nod.\n \n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n “I’ll get to it in a bit,” you tell him, a slight tinge of defiance in your voice. \n\n \n\n Lennox’s eyes narrow, but you can see the surprise on his face. “Excuse me, Miss. Cinders? You’ll get to it? In a bit?\"\n\n \n\n You nod, trying to meet his cold eyes and only being partially successful. “I’m needed in the kitchen,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n “I bet you are,” he says, a sneer in his voice. “You spend a lot of time in there. Alone. With Pierre.”\n\n \n\n This time you say nothing. After a moment, he flares his nostrils and snarls at you.\n\n \n\n “Fine,” he barks. “Get yourself to the kitchen. But I expect the lobby to be spotless within the hour.”\n\n \n\n He turns and returns to his work, leaving you alone.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “Yes sir,” you say, hearing your voice meek and subservient.\n \n \n\n “Get to it, then,” he barks back at you. \n\n \n\n You walk over to the cleaning trolley and take out a feather duster. For the next hour, you brush down the oak panelling and dim lampshades. Your feet soon begin to ache as you stretch up to dust the tops of paintings and fixtures, trying desperately not to fall over when you lean back on to the stilettos of your heels.\n\n \n\n With your petite frame, the lobby feels oppressive and hostile. Lennox watches you carefully as he goes about his work, but additionally you catch the handful of guests giving you looks. You become all too aware of the shortness of your uniform and catch the male patrons staring at your legs. You can’t help but wonder if they catch a glimpse of your buttocks as you stretch up to clean.\n\n \n\n Time soon passes and once you feel you have cleaned the entire lobby, you look over to Lennox to seek his approval. He stares back at you for a moment, but says nothing.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You take a deep breath, holding it steady as you focus the spell. Slowly, you exhale, letting the magic drift toward Lennox like a subtle breeze. His expression remains fixed in its usual disdainful sneer at first, but then his posture loosens slightly, his sharp gaze softening just enough to give you an opening.\n\n \n\n Lennox sighs through his nose, adjusting his cuffs with deliberate precision. \"Fine,\" he mutters, his tone clipped and cold. \"I have enough to do than play babysitter to people like you.\"\n\n \n\n He steps aside with a slow, deliberate motion, gesturing toward the staircase with a sharp flick of his hand. \"Go on, then. First floor. Try not to embarrass yourself. Or worse, other guests.\" His words drip with sarcasm, though there’s a strange, detached smoothness to them, as if he’s barely aware of why he’s letting you through.\n\n \n\n As you pass, he straightens his jacket and exhales sharply. \"I assume you’re capable of finding your own way,\" he adds, his tone returning to its usual cutting edge. \"Don’t make a mess of it. And for heaven’s sake, don’t draw attention to yourself. I don’t have the time or the patience to explain why you’re up there.\"\n\n \n\n His eyes linger on you for a moment, narrowing slightly as though he’s trying to convince himself that this makes sense. Then he waves you off with an air of finality, turning his attention back to the lobby as though you’ve already ceased to exist.\n\n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Lennox has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You stand your ground, meeting Lennox’s smirking gaze with a level, unshaken stare.\n\n \n\n “This is a mistake,” you say smoothly, arms crossed. “I was on an errand for the hotel, and Sermon overreacted.”\n\n \n\n Lennox raises an eyebrow, clearly amused. “Oh? And what exactly were you doing out there, parading around town in that get-up?”\n\n \n\n You exhale sharply, keeping your voice calm, but firm. “There was a guest request. One of the regulars needed an item picked up. I was just handling it quickly between duties. If I changed out of the uniform, it would’ve wasted even more time.”\n\n \n\n Lennox’s smirk lingers, but you see the way his eyes narrow slightly, calculating. He lets the silence stretch, letting you sweat under his gaze, before finally exhaling through his nose, rolling his eyes.\n\n \n\n “Fine,” he mutters, waving a dismissive hand. “Get out of here before Sermon decides he wants your head on a silver platter.”\n\n \n\n You nod sharply, turning toward the door without hesitation. You’ll have to be more careful when outside as Andrea from now on.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n Lennox’s smirk widens, the amusement in his eyes growing sharper as he watches you desperately try to explain yourself.\n\n \n\n “An errand?” he repeats, mocking, his voice dripping with disbelief. “Really, Miss Cinders?”\n\n \n\n He tilts his head, studying you like you’re some pathetic little thing trying to climb out of a hole you dug yourself into.\n\n \n\n Then, before you can even open your mouth to try again, he grabs your wrist and turns sharply, guiding you toward the door with purposeful strides. “Come!”\n\n \n\n “Wha --\" you stammer. \"Lennox, wait -”\n\n \n\n “No, no,” he cuts you off, dragging you forward. “You wanted to play the responsible, dutiful little maid, didn’t you? Then it’s only right you take responsibility for your actions.”\n\n \n\n Your heart sinks as he pushes open the door and leads you through to the hotel. Toward the hotel restaurant.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You swallow hard, your pulse quickening as you look at Lennox’s unimpressed stare.\n\n \n\n \"I... didn't mean to cause trouble,” you stammer, voice softer than you’d like. “Please. If you just let me go, I won’t do it again.”\n\n \n\n Lennox tilts his head, watching you with quiet amusement.\n\n \n\n “Let you go?” He grins, like a cat playing with a cornered mouse. “Are you suggesting I forget the standards we have here at the Charlton Hotel?”\n\n \n\n Your breath catches, but you push forward, voice wavering but desperate.\n\n \n\n “Because…” You hesitate, before forcing yourself to meet his gaze, trying to look as pitiful as possible. “I don’t want to get in trouble. Please, Mr. Lennox.”\n\n \n\n His smirk flickers, something satisfied gleaming behind his eyes. “Mr. Lennox?”\n\n \n\n You gulp. “Sir.”\n\n \n\n The begging. The submission. The way you’re waiting on his decision. For a long moment, he savors it.\n\n \n\n “Very well,” he sighs, like he’s doing you a great favor. “But only because I don’t feel like dealing with your whimpering today.”\n\n \n\n You nod quickly, turning toward the door.\n\n \n\n But just as you reach for the handle, his voice drawls behind you.\n\n \n\n “A word of advice. Don’t go skipping around town in uniform again, Miss. Cinders. You make the place look unprofessional.”\n\n \n\n You bite your lip, forcing yourself to nod and walk out without looking back.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You swallow hard, pulse quickening as you meet Lennox’s cold, amused gaze.\n\n \n\n “I... I didn’t mean to cause trouble,” you stammer, voice smaller than you’d like. “Please, just let me go. I won’t do it again.”\n\n \n\n Lennox’s lips curl, his smirk deepening. He leans against the lockers, arms crossed, watching you like you’re some desperate little thing squirming under his attention.\n\n \n\n “Oh, you won’t do it again, will you?” His voice is mocking, but there’s an undercurrent of something sharper beneath it. “Well, that’s sweet, Miss Cinders. Really, it is.”\n\n \n\n His smile lingers, but his eyes darken. “But tell me,” he continues, voice silkier now, “why should I just let you off? What kind of example would that set?”\n\n \n\n You open your mouth to say something - anything - but he’s already pushing himself off the wall, gripping your wrist firmly.\n\n \n\n Your stomach drops.\n\n \n\n “No, I think an apology is in order.”\n\n \n\n And just like that, he’s pulling you forward, his grip firm. Your heart sinks as he pushes open the door and leads you through to the hotel. Toward the hotel restaurant.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You inhale deeply, drawing your magic from within, feeling it coax through your breath as you exhale. A subtle, shimmering mist of gold and amber drifts from your lips, sliding invisibly through the air toward Lennox.\n\n \n\n His expression softens, the sharp edge of his usual sarcastic smirk dulling, his eyes blinking just a little slower than before.\n\n \n\n “Please sir,” you say smoothly, stepping closer, voice sweet and gentle. “I really don’t want to be in trouble for something so silly. You don’t want to waste time with this, do you?”\n\n \n\n He tilts his head slightly, blinking lazily. “Hmm,” he murmurs, voice slightly dazed. “No… I suppose I don’t.”\n\n \n\n You press further, tilting your head in an innocent, almost apologetic way. “Then just let me go,” you coax. “It’s easier that way, right?”\n\n \n\n Lennox hesitates for just a moment. Then he shrugs, rubbing his temple. “Just... go before Sermon finds you again.”\n\n \n\n You smile sweetly, stepping toward the door. As you pass, he frowns slightly, like he’s trying to recall why he was mad in the first place. But the charm lingers.\n\n \n\n And by the time you’re out the door, he doesn’t even seem to care anymore.\n \n\n \n Game broken, as Lennox doesn't have magic.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Lennox offers you a thin smile. “Excellent. Follow me.”\n\n \n\n He leads you away from the reception, down a side hallway, and to a door tucked beneath the grand staircase. He opens it with a flourish.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Lennox’s smile tightens. “Ah. A pity.”\n\n \n\n He clasps his hands in front of him, tone growing more brittle with every word.\n\n \n\n “It is so very rare to find young women who are capable of managing their time with any degree of discipline these days. But I do understand. Hair to be curled, household duties to attend to, and all that.”\n\n \n\n He glances at his watch. “Do return when your schedule permits.” His tone is dry enough to sand a floor.\n\n \n\n “I’m currently reviewing a number of applicants,” he adds, brushing a speck from his cuff. “But given the state of modern attitudes toward work, I suspect the role shall remain open for some time.”\n\n \n\n He nods toward the lobby without another word. You are dismissed.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Lennox adjusts slightly in his chair, opening his notebook and uncapping the sleek black fountain pen.\n\n \n\n “Let us begin with a question on customer service. A scenario.”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t look at you as he speaks. His attention is entirely on the notebook, the pen already hovering.\n\n \n\n “You are working front desk. A guest comes down, agitated. They claim the towels in their room were not replaced. You are certain they were. However, when the towels are shown to you, they appear quite… soiled.”\n\n \n\n He pauses, glancing up at you.\n\n \n\n “There are, shall we say, marks of indeterminate origin. The guest is insistent. How do you respond?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [House Proud] <>\n\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n You blink, the mental image of dirty towels causing you to feel queasy. “Honestly, I’d be horrified,” you can’t help but reply. *Even more concerning is that’s the honest truth.*\n\n \n\n “I’d replace the towels immediately and take them down to be properly cleaned. It wouldn’t matter if I was sure I did it before. If they’re dirty now, they need cleaning.”\n\n \n\n Lennox gives a slow nod. “Excellent. Quite right. At the Charlton Hotel, a guest’s perception is reality. It is not your job to defend your honour, Miss Phillips. It is your job to meet needs. Quickly. Quietly. Without fuss.”\n\n \n\n He taps his notebook. “Whether you changed the towels is immaterial. The customer must never be left with cause to doubt our standards. Even if their requests seem unreasonable… or outside your remit.”\n\n \n\n A faint smile. “The intention, I hope, is clear.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You hesitate, recalling when you used to work part-time jobs at University. You know the scenarios and know how to respond. Even when you are in the right.\n\n \n\n “I’d apologise,” you say. “And suggest I must have mistaken which room they were in. I’d still swap the towels out immediately.”\n\n \n\n Lennox raises an eyebrow. “Even if you are adamant you performed your duties?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “It’s not about being right. It’s about making the guest happy.”\n\n \n\n There’s a flicker of approval. “Very good. Our personal pride must always yield to our professional duty. Arguing achieves nothing. Swift resolution does. Well said.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You grimace. It’s not like you don’t understand customer service, you worked enough jobs at University to know what Lennox expects from you. But in Charlton, you know, the smallest sign of appeasement seems to lead to dangerous consequences.\n\n \n\n “I’d tell them I definitely changed the towels,” you say. “But I’d swap them out again just to be sure.”\n\n \n\n Lennox’s face hardens just slightly. “I see. So you would contradict the guest. Assert your version of events.”\n\n \n\n “I’d just want to be honest.”\n\n \n\n He writes something down, the pen scratching with quiet precision.\n\n \n\n “You must learn this now, Miss Phillips: our guests are never liars. Only… misinformed. And even then, it is not our place to say so. If your first instinct is to defend yourself, rather than serve. Well, that may need work.”\n\n \n\n He looks back up. “Shall we continue?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Lennox flips the page in his notebook. The pen glides into position again.\n\n \n\n “Let us discuss competence,” he says. “And, more specifically, the recognition of one’s… limitations.”\n\n \n\n He taps the page lightly. “You are doing laundry in the service room. The machines are complex, industrial-grade. You find yourself struggling with the dials, the settings… which cycle is which, how long, how hot. It’s rather overwhelming.”\n\n \n\n Lennox’s gaze settles coolly on you. “And then, in walks Mr. Sermon himself. Eager to meet his new maid.”\n\n \n\n His voice takes on a silken edge. “He watches you fumble. And says, ‘Do you need help, young lady? These settings can be complicated for someone like you. Do I need to explain how to operate a washing machine?’”\n\n \n\n There is a long pause. Then: “How do you respond?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [Citizen Charlton] <>\n\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n You hesitate, but the image forms clearly in your mind. Sermon standing tall, authoritative, questioning your ability. And the strangest thing is… you don’t want to argue.\n\n \n\n Of course you could work it out. You’ve written code. Handled backend systems more complicated than any appliance. But something in the tone you assign to him makes you wilt.\n\n \n\n If he thinks you need help… maybe you do.\n\n \n\n “I’d ask him for help,” you say softly. “If Mr. Sermon believes I’m struggling, I wouldn’t want to waste time.”\n\n \n\n Lennox gives a long, pleased sigh. “Good. Very good. Some things,” he adds pointedly, “are simply beyond the capacity of a young lady’s brain. They are smaller, after all. Not made for the complexities of machinery.”\n\n \n\n He leans closer, voice like syrup. “Deferring to a man’s intellect is often the most… efficient path. Mr. Sermon would appreciate that. He might even give you an affectionate pat on the bum for being such a good girl.”\n\n \n\n Your breath hitches.\n\n \n\n “And I dare say,” Lennox smiles thinly, “you’d like that. Wouldn’t you?”\n\n \n\n A shiver runs down your spine. Not from disgust. But because… he might be right.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You try to imagine it. The knobs. The unfamiliar cycles. Maybe you could figure it out… but then again, maybe you’ve overestimated yourself. Maybe this job requires more nuance than you assumed.\n\n \n\n “I’d admit I didn’t understand it,” you say. “At least not completely. I’d ask for help.”\n\n \n\n Lennox nods slowly. “It’s refreshing to see honesty. So many young women think this sort of work is all tips and smiling at guests.”\n\n \n\n He uncaps his pen with a sharp click. “But recognising when a task exceeds your capabilities… that shows maturity. Knowing your limits is the mark of a reliable maid.”\n\n \n\n You nod faintly.\n\n \n\n Still… it’s just a washing machine. *Isn’t it?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You frown. “Honestly? I’d tell Mr. Sermon I appreciate the offer, but I’d like to figure it out myself. It’s just a washing machine. I’m sure I could manage.”\n\n \n\n Lennox’s face cools immediately. “I see. So you would decline the offer of assistance. Risk inefficiency. Risk error. All in the name of… pride?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “I’d just rather not trouble him.”\n\n \n\n He closes his notebook slowly. “Andrea said the same when she started. Until we had a week of white linens turned pink and she had her pay docked.”\n\n \n\n He straightens, voice like glass. “Young women must understand that guidance exists for a reason. Your job is not to prove something. It is to deliver results. And at this hotel, that means recognising when something is beyond you.”\n\n \n\n His smile returns, but it’s cold this time. “You’ll need to understand that if you wish to work here.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Lennox flips another page, eyes calm and unreadable.\n\n \n\n “Let’s consider… interpersonal boundaries,” he says, voice light but deliberate. “And the expectations of a young woman in a place such as this.”\n\n \n\n His pen floats above the page. “You are dusting a guest’s room. A prominent figure in Charlton, let’s say. Someone returning from a productive day of meetings at the Town Hall. They’re in high spirits. Grateful for the hard work you’ve put in.”\n\n \n\n Lennox leans back slightly, almost enjoying the scene he’s painting.\n\n \n\n “They order room service. A fine meal. And then, they extend an invitation. For you to stay. To dine. To celebrate with them. A quiet dinner. A little company.”\n\n \n\n He tilts his head. “How do you respond?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [Boy Crazy] <>\n\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n\n Your cheeks flush before you even realise it.\n\n \n\n “A guest?” you murmur, a flutter catching in your chest. “What… do they look like?”\n\n \n\n Lennox’s pen halts mid-stroke. He frowns.\n\n \n\n “This is not a dating agency, Miss Phillips,” he says sharply. “We are not running a social club for the romantically inclined.”\n\n \n\n You squirm in your seat, but your thoughts drift anyway. To glasses clinking, candlelight, the warmth of a gaze across the table. A guest, charmed by you. Holding your hand. A soft bed only a few feet away…\n\n \n\n “A maid at the Charlton Hotel,” Lennox continues coldly, “has the establishment’s reputation to uphold. Floozy behaviour might be standard at certain low-rent motels, but here? We maintain decorum. Unauthorised fraternisation is not allowed.”\n\n \n\n The word unauthorised flickers in your mind. *Might be a version that is allowed?*\n\n \n\n “Focus,” Lennox snaps. “This is not the time to entertain your little fantasies about eligible bachelors, Miss Phillips.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n You hesitate. The scenario plays out in your mind. An invitation, polite and sincere. A guest who simply wants a bit of company after a long day.\n\n \n\n “I think I’d accept,” you say. “If they were kind. Polite. It wouldn’t be a date. It’d be customer care.”\n\n \n\n Lennox exhales. A disappointed sound, but not a surprised one. “There is a line, Miss Phillips. One must always maintain boundaries. This is a hotel, not a madam’s boudoir.”\n\n \n\n You blink. “I understand.”\n\n \n\n “Unauthorised fraternisation is strictly frowned upon,” he says. \n\n \n\n The word lingers in your mind. Unauthorised?\n\n \n\n Lennox’s voice slices through your thoughts. “I commend your dedication to customer service,” he says, “but in this case, preserving the dignity of the hotel must come first. A polite decline would suffice.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You shift in your seat. “I’d thank them for the invitation, but decline,” you say firmly. “I’d mention I have duties still to finish. And… I’d try not to offend them.”\n\n \n\n Lennox’s pen glides confidently across the page. “And if the guest insisted?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “I’d decline again. Politely. But clearly.”\n\n \n\n Lennox’s eyes gleam with something almost like approval. “Good. Very good. The Sermon family values its name, Miss Phillips. This hotel is a place of professionalism. Not… indulgence.”\n\n \n\n He straightens a little. “Any unauthorised relationships with guests are strictly prohibited. I’m glad you understand that your behaviour reflects on this establishment.”\n\n \n\n You nod. But inside, the word sticks in your mind like a pebble in your shoe. *Unauthorised?*\n\n \n\n Lennox clears his throat. “Too many young women fail to walk that delicate line between being polite… and retaining their virtue. I’m relieved to see you are not one of them.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Lennox places his fountain pen down with slow, deliberate precision. He closes the notebook, then rests it beside him on the desk.\n\n \n\n “Well, Miss Phillips,” he says, his voice smooth and unreadable, “that was… very insightful.”\n\n \n\n \n He clasps his hands together, almost pleased. “Your answers showed a strong grasp of customer expectations and internal conduct. Your instincts were sharp. Your manners, suitably deferential.”\n\n \n\n A thin smile.\n\n \n\n “I believe you’ll do outstandingly well here. You’ve demonstrated the kind of mindset Mr. Sermon prizes. One of service, discretion, and respectability. I’m sure your time with us will be fruitful. At least,” he adds, eyes flicking over your face, “until you settle down and raise a family of your own.”\n\n \n\n He lets the words linger before adding, “But that’s a few years away, I should hope. Until then…”\n\n \n\n He pulls a crisp envelope from his drawer. “A little incentive. An advance. A reflection of the trust we are extending.” \n \n He exhales softly, nodding. “You did well. A few answers could use refinement, but overall I believe you’ll settle in here just fine.”\n\n \n\n Lennox then fixes you with a more serious look. “Remember, at the Charlton Hotel, a maid must always consider two things: the reputation of this establishment… and the experience of the guest.”\n\n \n\n His tone hardens slightly. “I expect you’ll work on the areas where you require a step up. And I’ll be happy to assist where needed.”\n\n \n Lennox pauses. “I shall be blunt. There are… concerns. Your responses indicate you are not yet aligned with our expectations.”\n\n \n\n He stands. “Ordinarily, I would have serious reservations about offering you a place here.”\n\n \n\n Then he sighs. “But our applicant pool has been rather limited of late. So I’m willing to extend you an opportunity. With the understanding that you will learn.”\n\n \n\n He leans in ever so slightly. “And if not… well. We have ways to encourage the right attitudes.”\n\n \n \n\n Lennox opens a drawer and removes a small form. He hands it to you. “Fill in your measurements and personal details. Your uniform will be ready in the staff locker before your first shift. The code to the staff room is written at the top of that form. See that you remember it.”\n\n \n\n He adds, “Do not wear it outside. Mr. Sermon is… particular. He expects his maids to uphold this hotel’s standards. Public shame reflects poorly on us all.”\n\n \n\n Then he straightens, the faintest smile returning. “I expect to see you for your first evening shift promptly. Welcome to the staff, Miss Phillips.”\n\n \n\n He gestures to the door. “You may go.”\n\n \n\n *You should really let Emily know you’ve taken a job at the hotel as her, so she doesn’t go to the hotel when you’re working.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Invigorating. The centre of my world.” \n\n \n\n He looks at you, waiting for you to respond. “You’re Phillips’ older sister, right? She’s in some of my classes. She's fun.”\n\n \n\n You give him a look. \"Easy, no offense meant. She's just cute, is all.\"\n\n \n\n You look at him, feeling odd to be discussing your sister in this way. *Especially as recently your sister has been you.* \n\n \n\n “Now, if you don’t mind,” Logain says, gesturing away. “I have things to do.”\n\n \n “You go to Charlton, right?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n “As little as I can,” he replies. “But there’s not much else to do in our sleepy little town, so sometimes I grace them with my presence.”\n\n \n\n “How do you find it?”\n\n \n\n “Stimulating.

Special privileges, like all the top performers. Cheerleaders, geeks, jocks. He seems to think it's a reward for keeping in line.” Logain snorts. “Letting us wander this dead town aimlessly. Such a generous guy.”\n\n \n\n You tilt your head a little. “And which group do you figure you fall into?”\n\n \n\n Logain’s grin widens. “Family connections,” he replies, voice laced with sarcasm. “My old man would rather I bunk off with his blessing than end up in detention.”\n \n <> \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n “Waiting for the old man,” he tells you. “Although he’s usually out to lunch on Wednesdays and Fridays. Every Wednesday and Friday. It makes you wonder who he’s taking out in such a small town?”\n\n \n\n When you say nothing, Logain gives you a look and narrows his eyes. “You don’t get on with the old man, do you? Don't pander to his whims. I’ve heard him say some not-so-pleasant things to you on the phone.”\n\n \n\n You shrug. “He’s my boss.” \n\n \n\n Logain looks around, then leans in. “How would you like to get a bit of payback?”\n\n \n\n It’s your turn to narrow your eyes. “Like what?”\n\n \n\n Logain gestures to the door to Thompson’s office. “There’s a set of keys in there, one for almost every store in the town. Old time town means old time trust, and it’s easier for Gordo’ and Clive to do repairs when they don’t need to wait for access.”\n\n \n\n “You want that set of keys?”\n\n \n\n “Just one,” Logain replies, grinning. “The cellar door to the Charlton Hotel.”\n\n \n\n You sigh. “Keg run?”\n\n \n\n “I’m a simple boy with growing needs,” Logain responds. “And those needs involve alcohol. Unfortunately the old man keeps his door locked when he’s out, as much as I swing by occasionally to see if his memory is going. Only him and that secretary have access.”\n\n \n\n “You, though,” he adds. “You’re here all the time. You're friends with that secretary too, right? Solidarity under duress and all that. If you were to find a way to open the door, and I was to get a certain key, then I’d owe you a favour. Maybe put in a good word with my dad. Or look out for your sister at school?”\n\n \n\n “Think it over,” he adds. “I’ll be around if you get it.”\n \n \n “Waiting for the old man,” he tells you. “Although he’s usually out to lunch on Wednesdays and Fridays.

Mulling over profound and deep thoughts in the serenity of the evening.”\n\n \n\n He cracks a wry smile as you raise an eyebrow. “What? You don’t see me as tortured and deep?”\n\n \n\n \n The door to McTafey’s bar bursts open, interrupting your conversation. A stocky middle-aged man walks out, shaking his head at Logain as he passes. The teenager grimaces.\n\n \n\n “Or,” Logain says to you as he watches the man go. “I could be trying to get one of these idiots to buy me a six-pack so I can have some fun.”\n\n \n The bolts on the doors to McTafey's bar shudder aside, interrupting your conversation. A stocky middle-aged man stumbles out, as Rhiannon holds the door open for him. \"Last orders is last orders,\" she tells him with a grin.\n\n \n\n The man either doesn't notice Logain or avoids his gaze. “Or,” Logain says to you as he watches the man go. “I could be trying to get one of these idiots to buy me a six-pack so I can have some fun.”\n\n \n \n\n \n Once the man is out of sight, he looks back at you. “Say, you’ve got an older sister, right? She works for my dad. Is she as earnest and debbie-do-right as you?”\n\n \n\n “Is that your way of asking me to see if she will buy you beer?” you say to him.\n\n \n\n “You catch on quick, squirt. Tell her to come see me if she can grab a pack. And then maybe you could come see me after, if you fancy letting your hair down.”\n\n \n Once the man is out of sight, he looks back at you. “Say, you’ve got an older brother, right?

Tell him to come see me if he can grab a pack. And then maybe you could come see me after, if you fancy letting your hair down.”\n\n \n \n\n You give Logain a look. His blue eyes gleam, but with mischief and not lust. Despite this, you’re not sure drinking around Logain in Emily's form is going to turn out to be good for you.\n\n \n ”Oh, trying to have a little teenage delinquent fun,” Logain replies to your question. “But people around here seem to think that’s a bad idea.”\n\n \n\n \n The door to McTafey’s bar bursts open, interrupting your conversation. A stocky middle-aged man walks out, shaking his head at Logain as he passes. The teenager grimaces.\n\n \n\n “I gave that guy four notes,” he tells you, watching the man walk off. “Some people. Look down on some rite of passage underage drinking, but happy to scam a kid out of the allowance their parents worked hard for to give to them. Leeches.”\n\n \n\n When the man is out of sight, Logain turns back to you and studies you for a moment. “I don’t suppose you’d be happy to help a poor kid pull together a six-pack for an otherwise mundane Saturday evening? McTafey’s sells take-aways. I could put in a good word with the old man. I'm sure you'd welcome something to make work a bit easier for you.”\n\n \n The bolts on the doors to McTafey's bar shudder aside, interrupting your conversation.

A stocky middle-aged man stumbles out, as Rhiannon holds the door open for him. \"Last orders is last orders,\" she tells him with a grin.\n\n \n\n The man either doesn't notice Logain or avoids his gaze. \"I gave that guy four notes,\" Logain says to you as he watches the man go. \"Some people. Look down on some rite of passage underage drinking, but happy to scam a kid out of the allowance their parents worked hard for to give to them. Leeches.\"\n\n \n\n When the man is out of sight, Logain turns back to you and studies you for a moment. \"I don't suppose you'd be happy to help a poor kid pull together a six-pack one Saturday night? McTafey's sells take-aways. Rhiannon won't let anyone in this evening, I'd wager, but next time I can be waiting. I could put in a good word with the old man. If he treats you anything like the way he treats other ladies, I'm sure you'd welcome something to make work a bit easier for you.”\n\n \n \n\n “If you do happen to come across a neglected six-pack in need of a good home, you know where to find me.”\n \n \n ”Oh, trying to have a little teenage delinquent fun,” Logain replies to your question. “But people around here seem to think that’s a bad idea.”\n\n \n\n \n The door to McTafey’s bar bursts open, interrupting your conversation. A stocky middle-aged man walks out, shaking his head at Logain as he passes. The teenager grimaces.\n\n \n\n “I gave that guy four notes,” he tells you, watching the man walk off. “Some people. Look down on some rite of passage underage drinking, but happy to scam a kid out of the allowance their parents worked hard for to give to them. Leeches.”\n\n \n\n When the man is out of sight, Logain turns back to you and studies you for a moment. “I don’t suppose you’d be happy to help a poor kid pull together a six-pack for an otherwise mundane Saturday evening? McTafey’s sells take-aways. I could put in a good word with the old man. Make work a bit easier for you.”\n\n \n The bolts on the doors to McTafey's bar shudder aside, interrupting your conversation.

Mate’s rates, naturally.”\n\n \n\n “You’re selling booze?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Well done, Nancy Drew.” He sniggers. “Not going to rat me out, are you?”\n\n \n\n You sigh. “Aren’t you afraid you’ll get caught?”\n\n \n\n He chuckles at your question. “All part of the fun. Besides, I know enough to know who to ask. And when to make a sharp exit. You sure you don’t want some? Not much else to do around here. Got a nice batch of premixes. Four pounds a can, or your best offer for the lot.”\n\n \n\n “I think I'll pass,” you say, unsure of what your tolerance to alcohol would be currently.\n\n \n\n “Suit yourself,” he says, his attention turning back to looking around for customers.\n\n \n ”I saw those kids, giving you some cash,” you say quietly. “What racket have you got set up here, Logain?”\n\n \n\n “I’m just a good samaritan. Providing a service to the unappreciated teenagers of Charlton, trying to find some meaning at the bottom of a bottle.”\n\n \n\n “You’re selling kids booze?” you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n “Yes. And you’re making it very obvious,” he says, flashing you a grin that would make a shark envious. \n\n \n\n \n \n A grin creeps up on your face. ”Is that why you wanted the cellar door key?” \n\n \n \n “Bingo,” he says, with an edge of theatrical drama. “Supply and demand, my friend. Batch quantities of liquor are hard to come by. If the town can’t provide, I just fill in the gap. The customer is always right.”\n \n \n ”And your great business is what, getting adults to buy it for you?” you say to him, raising an eyebrow. “And then marking it up?”\n\n \n\n He gives you a knowing grin. “I think of it more as a service tax. Batch quantities of liquor are hard to come by. So I get a mark-up for standing outside, freezing my arse off. And a bravado margin for having the balls to put myself out there when asking people. It’s touch and go whether people take kindly to kids asking them to buy booze.”\n\n \n \n ”I saw those kids, giving you some cash,” you say quietly. “What racket have you got set up here, Logain?”\n\n \n\n “I’m just a good samaritan, doll. Providing a service to the unappreciated teenagers of Charlton, trying to find some meaning at the bottom of a bottle.”\n\n \n\n “You’re selling kids booze?” you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n “Yes. And you’re making it very obvious,” he says, flashing you a grin that would make a shark envious. \n\n \n\n \n \n A grin creeps up on your face. ”Is that why you wanted the cellar door key?” \n\n \n\n “Bingo,” he says, with an edge of theatrical drama. “Supply and demand, my friend.

It’s touch and go whether people take kindly to kids asking them to buy booze.”\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You pull out the six-pack of beer and offer it to Logain. “Was this what you wanted?”\n\n \n\n His eyes grow wide as he sees the beer. A crooked grin spreads across his face as he takes the pack from you. “You’re full of surprises, aren’t you just, squirt?” \n\n \n\n “You can thank my ,” you tell him.\n \n \n \"I will,\" he says. \"But I don't think the old man is going to give a job back because of a word or two from his kid. Tough break for . Not the nicest of towns to be unemployed.\"\n\n Logain nods. “Tell I’ll say only nice things to the old man.” \n\n \n \n\n He holds the six pack up. “Care for a drink?” \n\n \n\n You briefly consider taking him up on the offer. There’s no malice in his words. Just mischief. But you’re not sure drinking around Logain in Emily's form is going to turn out to be good for you.\n\n \n\n “Maybe some other time,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n Logain shrugs. “I’ll be here if you change your mind.”\n\n \n You pull out the six-pack of beer and offer it to Logain. “Was this what you wanted?”\n\n \n\n He gives it a quick look and grins, taking it from your hands. “Thanks doll. You’re a lot of fun. I’ll be sure to let the old man know. In a way that doesn't encourage him.”\n\n \n\n You question whether Logain’s enthusiasm for you is exactly the sort of attention Annie would want Mr. Thompson to be aware of, but you leave him to enjoy his beer.\n \n \n \n You pull out the six-pack of beer and offer it to Logain. “Was this what you wanted?”\n\n \n\n \n \n He gives it a quick look and grins, taking it from your hands. “Thanks doll. You’re a lot of fun. Hope you've got no hard feelings towards me about the old man canning you. Trust me, I've experienced his wrath.\"\n\n \n\n You look for snark or sarcasm on his face, but his wince is genuine. As is his sympathetic smile. \"Tough town to be unemployed. Tougher on women. If you need help, I owe you one.\"\n \n \n He gives it a quick look and grins, taking it from your hands. “Thanks doll. You’re a lot of fun. I’ll be sure to let the old man know. In a way that doesn't encourage him.”\n\n \n\n You question whether Logain’s enthusiasm for you is exactly the sort of attention you want Mr. Thompson to be aware of, but you leave him to enjoy his beer.\n \n \n \n You pull out the six-pack of beer and offer it to Logain. “Was this what you wanted?”\n\n \n\n \n \n He gives it a quick look and grins, taking it from your hands. “Thanks chief. You’re a good sport. Hope you've got no hard feelings towards me about the old man canning you. Trust me, I've experienced his wrath.\"\n\n \n\n You look for snark or sarcasm on his face, but his wince is genuine. As is his sympathetic smile. \"Tough town to be unemployed. If you need help, I owe you one.\"\n \n \n He gives it a quick look and grins, taking it from your hands. “Thanks chief. You’re a good sport. I’ll be sure to let the old man know. In the most subtle way I know.”\n\n \n\n You question whether Logain’s definition of subtlety matches your own, but you leave him to enjoy his beer.\n\n \n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \"What do you need from me?\" you ask Logain.\n\n \n\n Logain gives you a look and narrows his eyes. “You don’t get on with the old man, do you?”\n\n \n\n You shrug. “He’s my boss.” \n\n \n\n Logain grins. \"Sure, coffee girl.\" He looks around, then leans in. “How would you like to get a bit of payback?”\n\n \n\n It’s your turn to narrow your eyes. “Like what?”\n\n \n\n “There’s a set of keys in his office,\" he tells you. \"One for almost every store in the town. I'm sure you've come across them.”\n\n \n\n “You want that set of keys?”\n\n \n\n “Not quite,” Logain replies, grinning. “Just one. The cellar door to the Charlton Hotel.”\n\n \n\n You sigh. “Keg run?”\n\n \n\n “I’m a simple boy with growing needs,” Logain responds. “And those needs involve alcohol. Unfortunately the old man keeps his door locked when he’s out, as much as I swing by occasionally to see if his memory is going. But you can get in there.”\n\n \n\n “The old man doesn't listen to many people,\" he continues. \"But he does worry about his reputation. If you were to get that key for me, I could drop a hint or two I've heard about his trips to Charlton Hotel during lunchtimes. If he thinks people are talking, I think you'll find his requests simmer down.\"\n\n \n\n “Think it over,” he adds. “I’ll be around if you get it.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n “Fine,” you say reluctantly. ”Say I do. What of it?”\n\n \n\n “I can help,” he tells you. “There’s ways to make DeBussy and all her little snitches disappear. I just need you to help me out.”\n\n \n\n You roll your eyes. “Help you out?”\n\n \n\n His sparkling blue eyes momentarily appraise your body, but he chuckles. “I’m not a fan of coercion, squirt. Nothing like that. I just need you to pick up that book for me when you’re done playing private detective.”\n\n \n\n You stare at his face as he flashes a half-smile at you. “What do you want with it?”\n\n \n\n The half-smile creeps into a full smirk. “Lot of money to be made in secrets, squirt. People pay handsomely to brokers.”\n\n \n\n You bite your bottom lip, thinking. An easy way into the Business Studies class appeals greatly to you. But you can’t help but wonder what harm you’d be causing to the other students at Charlton if Logain were to get his hands on that book. Also, are you quite prepared? You might not get another shot at getting in the room alone.\n\n \n\n One eyebrow rises up, as a challenge. “What say you, squirt? You game?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n “I'm just looking,” you tell him flatly. “Just curious.”\n\n \n\n He chuckles to himself. “Suit yourself, squirt. But I recognise a fellow knowledge-seeker when I see one. When that itch gets too much to bear, come back here. I’ll be waiting.”\n\n \n\n Giving you a smile, Logain saunters off. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You give him a look, but nod. He grins broadly. \n\n \n\n “See the stairwell over there,” he says, pointing up the corridor. “Go make use of your petiteness and hide underneath it. Ready or not, in ten seconds they’ll be coming.”\n\n \n\n You look back at him, but he just silently mouths a countdown at you. *Ten. Nine. Eight.*\n\n \n\n With a rush of nervous energy, you spin around and totter as fast as your heels will allow you to. The stairwell has a small dark alcove underneath the steps. You duck underneath, trying to retain a degree of modesty in case Logain is watching you.\n\n \n\n Kneeling down, you turn to look out into the corridor. Logain still stands next to the lockers, looking back towards you. You wonder whether this is all just a joke to him when he mouths the last numbers in his countdown.\n\n \n\n And without moving from his spot, reaches up beside the lockers. Where you notice for the first time the fire alarm.\n\n \n\n The clanging of bells pierce your eardrums as the quiet corridor is suddenly filled with noise. You cover your ears, barely noticing Logain run past you and down the corridor. The persistent ringing is deafening.\n\n \n\n You just about hear the sound of footsteps over the din and glance out to see DeBussy and a gaggle of students evacuating the Business Studies classroom. They run past you, oblivious to your presence. \n\n \n\n When your ears become accustomed to the bell’s deafening tones, you slide out from the alcove and cautiously look up and down the corridor. It’s empty. Logain may be less than subtle, but he got the job done. \n\n \n\n With a hurried pace, you walk to the classroom door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I don’t think so, Logain,” you let him down.\n\n \n\n He shakes his head, but sniggers to himself. “You’re a really daisy-do-right, you know that? If you change your mind, come back. I’ll be around.”\n\n \n\n He flashes you a grin and walks out of the school.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You sigh and reach into your bag, taking out DeBussy's notebook, thrusting it out towards him.\n\n \n\n He takes it from you, flicking through the first few pages, murmuring as he reads a few of the entries. “Very interesting.”\n\n \n\n Then he looks up at you and grins. “Thanks, squirt. You really came through. I had no idea you could be so... endearing.\"\n\n \n\n “You satisfied?” you ask him, curtly.\n\n \n\n A half-cocked smile returns to his face. “For now. Stick around, squirt. I have a feeling this could be the start of a beautiful relationship.”\n\n \n\n You give him a look, but say nothing and hurriedly walk out of the school. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I don’t think so, Logain,” you tell him. “I think I’m going to keep this one for my own eyes.”\n\n \n\n The smile falls from his face. “What now?”\n\n \n\n It’s your turn to form a grin. “Like you said, lot of money to be made in secrets.”\n\n \n\n He grits his teeth. “You think you can cross me, Phillips?”\n\n \n\n You feel yourself stand up straighter. “I think I just did.”\n\n \n\n You see rage flash across his usual cool blue eyes. He sucks in air through his teeth and for a moment, you don’t know what will come next.\n\n \n\n “Fuck!” he spits, and whirls around on his heels. You watch him walk off.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I didn’t have time to get it,” you tell him. “I left it behind.”\n\n \n\n Logain rolls his bottom lip up, flaring his nostrils. “That’s disappointing, squirt,\" he says coldly. “After all I did for you.”\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry,” you say. “There just wasn’t enough time.”\n\n \n\n “I guess not.” \n\n \n\n Logain eyes you darkly, but breaks it off after a moment. “See you around, squirt. Hope you found what you were looking for.”\n\n \n\n He turns and walks away, leaving you alone.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You shake your head. “I’m not giving you this book, Logain. These things shouldn’t be public.”\n\n \n\n He cocks his head. “And tell me, what do you plan on doing with it?”\n\n \n\n Taking a deep breath, you reply. “I’m going to burn it.”\n\n \n\n He stares hard at you for a long moment. Then, he bursts out chuckling.\n\n \n\n “You’re such a do-gooder, squirt,” he says, as he continues to laugh. “What is the world like to you, I wonder? Is it all just endings and happily-ever-afters?”\n\n \n\n You give him a hard stare, saying nothing, as you feel rage rising inside you. Noticing your reaction, he tries to control his laughter.\n\n \n\n “Oh don’t worry, squirt. It’s endearing.” He flashes you a cocky smile. “How have you even survived here for this long?”\n\n \n\n “You’ll never find out,” you reply.\n\n \n\n “Maybe,” he says. “But that’s not going to stop me trying.”\n\n \n\n You let out an exasperated sigh. “Goodnight, Logain.”\n\n \n\n You turn on your heels and walk quickly away, feeling the anger bubble away in your body. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Out past curfew, princess?” he drawls. “Careful. You might develop a reputation.”\n\n \n\n You ignore the bait. “You’re resourceful. I was wondering, do you have access to student lockers?”\n\n \n\n His eyebrows lift, clearly amused. “Why, Emily. That’s the first halfway interesting thing you’ve ever said to me.”\n\n \n\n He reaches into his jacket and pulls out a jangling ring of keys, thumbing through them slowly and deliberately.\n\n \n\n Then, holding one up with exaggerated flair, he lets it catch the lamplight. “You mean... this locker key?”\n\n \n\n You keep your expression steady. “Maybe.”\n\n \n\n He smirks. “Didn’t think you had it in you to break rules. What’s the occasion? Someone take your lunch seat?”\n\n \n\n “I have a suspicion,” you say coolly. “That someone’s hiding something they shouldn’t be.”\n\n \n\n “That’s vague.” He twirls the key around his finger. “Suspicion’s not worth much around here. People suspect me of all sorts of things. Doesn’t mean I let them into my secrets.”\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Logain chuckles, tucking the key into your hand without ceremony.\n\n \n\n “You’re lucky I’m in a generous mood. Must be all that goodwill dad's secretary gave me.”\n \n \n He nods slowly, eyes narrowing.\n\n \n\n “Your did me a solid. Call this the return. Just don’t get caught. I’m not in the business of covering amateur tracks.”\n \n \n Logain grins, clearly enjoying himself.\n\n \n\n “You did me a favour. Now I’m returning it. Charlton runs on debts. I like to keep mine clean.”\n\n \n\n He drops the key into your hand with a quiet jingle.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Logain lets the key dangle just out of reach, then slowly tucks it back into his jacket with a click. “You know the deal. You want a favour? You owe me one.”\n\n \n\n He leans back, stretching his arms like he’s settling in. “There’s a set of keys in my old man's. Whole ring of them. One for practically every building in town. The school, stores, that grim little flower shop.”\n\n \n\n He gives you a pointed look. “I only want one. The cellar door to the Charlton Hotel.”\n\n \n\n You sigh. “Keg run?”\n\n \n\n Logain grins. “I’m a simple boy with growing needs. And the old man won’t share. He keeps the office locked up tight when he’s out.\" He lowers his voice, like sharing a dirty secret. “Only him and that secretary of his have access.\"\n\n \n\n You fold your arms. “And what, I’m just supposed to... walk in and take it?”\n\n \n\n “Of course not,” he says, mock-offended. “I’m not a criminal. I’m a thirsty citizen in need of discreet assistance. But I'm sure you could find a way in there. You get me that key and I’ll make sure you get what you want.\"\n\n \n\n He flashes you a wink, then turns away as if the matter’s already settled. “Think it over, Emily. I’ll be around.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n “Logain,” you say casually. “Do you have a hall pass?”\n\n \n\n He turns his head slowly toward you, one eyebrow rising. “Sometimes I like to do things by the book. When the book suits me.”\n\n \n\n You narrow your eyes. “So that’s a yes?”\n\n \n\n Logain shrugs, cocky grin returning. “I don’t like to kiss and tell. But I do like to brag. So… yes.”\n\n \n\n You cross your arms. “And how exactly did you get one?”\n\n \n\n He pauses, briefly glancing to the door to McTafeys. “The old man knows people,\" he says with a smirk. \"Has friends in the right places. You know. Connections. Family. Everything you’d expect from Charlton’s close knit elites.”\n\n \n\n He glances back at you, grin sharpening. “Not sure you’ve got that kind of clout in those crowds, squirt.”\n\n \n\n You bite back a retort. “So how would someone without ‘clout’ get one?”\n\n \n\n Logain chuckles again. “You want advice on how to break out of class? I’m sure I can think of better ways to run a scam. You scratch my back, I scratch yours.”\n\n \n\n You huff. “I don’t think I want you scratching my back, Logain.”\n\n \n\n He grins. “Your loss. I can be gentle when it suits.”\n\n \n\n When you don’t respond, he rolls his eyes. “Talk to Dennis. He’s odd, but plays his bad hand well. Enough to get Harrow on side. It’s definitely not his family that gets him out of lessons. You might be able to talk him ‘round. Just bat those pretty little eyes at him and I’m sure he’ll scramble to help you.”\n\n \n\n He stretches, as if signalling he’s done with this topic. “Anyway. That’s your best shot. Just don’t say I never gave you anything.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You stare at Logain. He glares at you. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n You mentally stir the magic within your body and take a deep breath, threading the air in your lungs through the swirling energies.\n\n \n\n Logain's eyes cloud over as you breathe out, his wry smile returning as his blue eyes glimmer as he looks at you. You see the alarm within them for a moment before it fades away. The magic has taken hold.\n\n \n\n \"Want something, cutie?\" he murmurs, keeping his smile up at the side of his mouth. His eyes lock on to you, his attention consumed by your presence.\n\n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Logain has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Now stuck coming to small towns like this.”\n\n \n\n You give him a smile, trying to warm him to you. \"So you're looking for new talent?\"\n\n \n\n He nods. \"Now I spend my afternoons looking at skinny kids trying to impress the camera.

Now stuck coming to small towns like this.”\n\n \n\n You give him a grin, trying to warm him to you. \"So you're looking for new talent?\"\n\n \n\n He nods. \"Now I spend my afternoons looking at skinny kids trying to impress the camera. And my evenings in the hotel looking at the photos of them.\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You glance around him, taking in the photos spread across the bleachers. \"Are these photos of the school football team?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Yup,” he replies, barely looking up. “I’m in town to see if there’s any diamonds in the rough.”\n\n \n\n \"Anyone standing out?\"\n\n \n\n \n At that he looks up at you, offering you a thin smile. \"Easy on the gas there, chief. I'll make my own mind up on whether you've got what it takes.\"\n\n \n He doesn't look up as he grunts. \"Slim pickings this year. Beach mentioned a few names, but that man has always paid more attention to the girls in his swimteam than the lads on the pitch. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n \n \n\n You continue to wait to catch his eye, but he doesn't look up from looking over the photos.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \"I think you should consider Jake Duncan,\" you tell him, pointing to a photo of Jake running with the ball. “He’s the star quarterback.”\n\n \n\n Mac looks at you, quizzically. “That’s your star quarterback?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “Maybe he was just having an off-day,” you tell him. “He’s really held the team together this year.”\n\n \n\n Mac looks to you, then shrugs. \"Sorry if I don't take your word as gospel, princess. Wouldn't be the first school girl trying to butter me up to get her boyfriend a scholarship.\"\n\n \n\n Your mouth drops open, ready to retort. But you pause, as you realise the words that were coming wouldn't address his condescending tone.\n\n \n\n *He's not my boyfriend.*\n\n \n \"I think you should consider Jake Duncan,\" you tell him, pointing to a photo of Jake running with the ball. “He’s the star quarterback.”\n\n \n\n Mac looks at you, quizzically. “That’s your star quarterback?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “Maybe he was just having an off-day,” you tell him. “He’s really held the team together this year.”\n\n \n\n Mac looks to you and smirks. \"Don't look like the type of kid that knows how to spot a star player. Think I'll keep evaluating. Myself.\"\n\n \n\n Your mouth drops open, ready to retort. But you pause, feeling a wave of anxiety rush up from his rebuttal. Dennis isn't exactly the type of person that's going to convince him.\n\n \n \"I think you should consider me,\" you tell him, pointing to a photo of Jake running with the ball. “I'm the star quarterback.”\n\n \n\n Mac looks at you, quizzically. “You're the star quarterback?”\n\n \n\n You nod, feeling a rush of anger at hearing his words. \"Yup. I really held the team together this year.”\n\n \n\n Mac looks to you, but after a moment shakes his head. \"No offense, pal. But I need to hear something more objective before I'm willing to make that bet. Maybe spend a little more time on the pitch and we can talk.\"\n \n\n You feel yourself grinding your teeth in irritation, but you hold back your frustration and try to think logically. He's not going to accept Jake's opinion on this.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "Whether it’s due to Martin’s imposing physicality or his domineering personality, something inside you prevents you from standing up to him. You instead freeze, as the strong brute pulls you against his body.\n\n \n\n “Looks like you do,” Martin taunts. “What do you say, darl? My van is parked out on the street. Want to see what a real man looks like?”\n\n \n\n Images flash up in your mind. Martin’s van parked in a dark alley. The imposing drunk brute towering over you. The sort of things that you can only imagine he’s insinuating in his offer for fun.\n\n \n\n “Think you should leave the girl alone,” you hear a voice say from behind you. \n\n \n\n A hand reaches in and twists Martin’s arm, instantly forcing him to let go of you. You look up to see Clive, holding Martin back with one arm.\n\n \n\n “What’s the matter, Burtle?” Martin spits at him. “Got a soft spot for her?”\n\n \n\n Clive stares back at Martin, not flinching. “Go. Sit.”\n\n \n\n \"It's okay,\" you interject. \"I don't mind.\"\n\n \n\n Noise in the bar has fallen away to silence. You take a step back, free from Martin's grasp, looking straight back at him. He grins.\n\n \n\n Out of the corner of your eye, you see Clive bristle. \"Well don't treat ladies like that in here,\" he says after a moment. \"Maybe try downstairs, Martin. Either way, take your business elsewhere. I think I speak for everyone when we say we don't want to see you back here for a while.\"\n\n \n\n After a tense moment, Martin snorts. “I’ll see you later,” he says to you, winking. He then walks out.\n\n \n\n The tense atmosphere diffused, you hear conversation start up again and soon the bar returns to normal. Clive stands by you, only turning his eyes to you once Martin has left.\n\n \n\n “You okay?” he asks you. \n\n \n\n You nod. “Yes.”\n\n \n\n He studies you for a moment, before grimacing. “You do you, darlin'. But my advice - avoid that one. The drink doesn’t mix well with him.”\n\n \n\n Clive smiles with concern, then returns to his own seat, leaving you alone once more.\n\n \n Whether it’s due to Martin’s imposing physicality or his domineering personality, something inside you prevents you from standing up to him. You instead freeze, as the strong brute pulls you against his body.\n\n \n\n “Looks like you do,” Martin taunts. “What do you say, darl? My van is parked out on the street. Want to see what a real man looks like?”\n\n \n\n Images flash up in your mind. Martin’s van parked in a dark alley. The imposing drunk brute towering over you. The sort of things that you can only imagine he’s insinuating in his offer for fun.\n\n \n\n “That’s enough!” you hear Rhiannon shout from behind the bar, her playful demeanour evaporated and replaced with a serious and assertive tone far beyond her young age.\n\n \n\n “What’s the matter?” Martin asks her, mockingly, as his hand starts to grope at your waist. “She wants it.”\n\n \n\n “You want me to call my father?” Rhiannon replies. \n\n \n\n \"It's okay,\" you hear your meek voice saying. \"I don't mind.\"\n\n \n\n Rhiannon stares at you, then raises an eyebrow. \"Well, I mind it happening whilst I'm working. I think you should leave, Martin. You're barred.\"\n\n \n\n At that, Martin gives you a look. A menacing smile passes across his face. \"Come see me later,\" he mutters to you. \"Better be worth being barred.\"\n \n \n\n You watch him go as he walks out the door, before turning to look at Rhiannon from underneath your eyelashes. She smiles politely, but returns to work. Other patrons follow her lead and turn back to their conversations. Soon the bar returns to normal.\n\n \n\n Except, your eyes linger on the door. To where Martin left.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n \n You swallow hard, trying to summon the words to appease Martin’s lecherous comments. Your movements are hesitant, and your voice wavers as you attempt to give him what he wants, but it’s clear you’re out of your depth.\n\n \n\n Martin’s grin fades into a scowl, his thick fingers tightening briefly on your arm. \"What’s this?\" he growls, his voice heavy with disdain. \"You think you’re cute, playing coy? Don’t waste my time, darl. If you’ve got nothing to offer, don’t bother trying.\"\n\n \n\n Before you can respond, Martin’s looming presence is interrupted by a calm but commanding voice from behind you. \"Let her go, Martin.\"\n\n \n\n You glance back to see Clive, his expression steady but his eyes sharp. Martin’s grip loosens, and he sneers as he sizes up Clive. \"Burtle,\" Martin spits, his tone dripping with mockery. \"You always gotta stick your nose where it doesn’t belong?\"\n\n \n\n Clive steps closer, his towering frame radiating quiet authority. \"I said, let her go,\" he repeats, his voice leaving no room for argument.\n\n \n\n After a tense moment, Martin snorts, shoving you away as if you were nothing more than a minor inconvenience. \"She’s not worth it anyway,\" he mutters, flashing you a nasty smile. \"Next time, don’t waste my time.\"\n\n \n\n He storms back to his table, muttering under his breath. The tension in the room begins to dissipate, conversations resuming around you. Clive gives you a once-over, his tone softening as he asks, \"You alright?\"\n\n \n\n You nod, feeling a mix of shame and relief. \"Thanks,\" you manage to say.\n\n \n\n Clive nods, his expression unreadable. \"Be careful around him,\" he says quietly. \"He doesn’t take kindly to games. If I were you, I'd get out of here before he has another.\"\n\n \n\n You glance over at Martin, then nod to Clive. \"Sure.\"\n\n \n You try to appease Martin, but your shaky movements and hesitant voice betray your lack of confidence. Martin’s grin twists into an ugly sneer, his hand tightening on your waist as his patience wears thin.\n\n \n\n \"Pathetic,\" he growls, his tone dripping with disgust. \"What’s this supposed to be? You think batting your eyelashes is gonna work? If you’re not gonna play properly, don’t bother wasting my time.\"\n\n \n\n His grip becomes uncomfortably firm, but before you can respond, a sharp voice cuts through the tension. \"That’s enough!\" Rhiannon shouts from behind the bar, her playful tone gone, replaced by a commanding authority that silences the room.\n\n \n\n Martin turns his glare to her, his lip curling. \"What’s the matter, little missy?\" he taunts. \"She’s the one asking for it. Can’t you see that?\"\n\n \n\n Rhiannon doesn’t flinch, her hands gripping the edge of the bar. \"You want me to call my father, Martin?\" she says, her voice steady, with just enough edge to cut through the room.\n\n \n\n The name hangs in the air like a warning. Martin’s sneer falters as he glances between you and Rhiannon. After a tense moment, he lets go, shoving you aside. \"Not worth it,\" he mutters, his tone filled with venom as he stalks back to his table.\n\n \n\n Rhiannon offers you a sympathetic look as the noise in the bar gradually returns to normal. \"You okay?\" she asks, her voice softer now.\n\n \n\n You nod, though your hands are still trembling. \"Thank you,\" you say quietly.\n\n \n\n \"Don’t thank me,\" she replies with a small smile. \"Just steer clear of Martin. He’s not someone you want to mess with. If I were you, I'd leave before he drinks more.\"\n\n \n\n With that, she moves on to serve another customer, leaving you alone with the lingering unease of Martin’s glare burning into your back. You decide to take her advice. Time to leave.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n \"Let me go!\" you snap, your voice sharp and steady as you glare up at Martin. When he doesn’t release you, you shove against his chest, forcing him to stumble back slightly. The shock in his eyes lasts only a second before anger begins to flare.\n\n \n\n \"Back off, Martin,\" you say, your tone firm and unwavering. \"You don’t scare me, and you’re not going to touch me again. Got it?\"\n\n \n\n For a moment, Martin just stares at you, his chest heaving as though trying to decide whether to lash out or back down. Then he smirks, though it’s more a grimace than a grin. \"Oh, you’ve got a big mouth, don’t you?\" he growls, taking a step toward you.\n\n \n\n \"Careful, Martin,\" Clive’s calm voice cuts through the tension like a knife. Martin freezes, his head snapping toward the sound. Clive steps forward, his expression unshakably neutral, but his presence radiates authority.\n\n \n\n \"What’s the matter, Burtle?\" Martin sneers, his tone dripping with venom. \"Always jumping to the rescue of little girls?\"\n\n \n\n Clive doesn’t flinch, his eyes locked on Martin. \"Go sit down,\" he says quietly, his voice carrying an unmistakable edge. \"Now.\"\n\n \n\n \"No,\" you hear yourself say, looking directly at the lecherous man. \"Better still. Leave.\"\n\n \n\n The bar grows even more tense. You don't look away from Martin, but out of the corner of your eye see Clive give you an appreciative look.\n\n \n\n \"You heard the lady,\" you hear him say. \"Best leave. Don't come back for a while.\"\n\n \n\n Martin’s jaw tightens, and for a moment, you think he might push back. But then he snorts, nostrils flaring. \"This isn’t over,\" he mutters, storming out the door.\n\n \n\n Clive turns to you, his expression softening slightly. \"You alright?\" he asks, his voice low.\n\n \n\n You nod, your pulse still racing. \"Thanks,\" you say, your voice steadier than you expected.\n\n \n\n He nods in return, giving you a small smile. \"You handled yourself well. Just keep your distance from him - he’s not worth your time.\"\n \n \n \"Let me go!\" you snap, shoving against Martin’s chest with a burst of force that catches him off guard. He stumbles slightly, his grin faltering as he straightens up, anger flashing across his face.\n\n \n\n \"Big mistake, sweetheart,\" he growls, taking a step toward you. But you stand your ground, your voice ringing out clear and steady.\n\n \n\n \"Stay away from me, Martin,\" you say, your eyes locking onto his. \"You’re not as tough as you think you are, and I’m not afraid of you.\"\n\n \n\n The room goes quiet, the low hum of conversation replaced by the tense silence of onlookers watching the exchange. Martin’s hands twitch at his sides, his face twisting with fury.\n\n \n\n \"That’s enough!\" Rhiannon’s voice cuts through the air, sharp and commanding. Martin jerks his head toward the bar, his glare shifting to her.\n\n \n\n \"Getting involved again, missy?\" he spits. \"Why don’t you mind your own business for once?\"\n\n \n\n Rhiannon doesn’t flinch, her hands firmly planted on the bar. \"Why don’t you?\" she retorts, her voice steady and unyielding. \"Walk away, Martin. Unless you want me to call my father.\"\n\n \n\n Martin’s sneer falters, his anger simmering just beneath the surface as he glares at both of you. After a long pause, he snarls, \"Not worth it,\" and stalks back towards his table.\n\n \n\n \"Better yet,\" you call after him. \"Why don't you just leave?\"\n\n \n\n Martin spins around to look at you, flashing his teeth. The quiet turns to deathly silence. You meet his eyes, not looking away.\n\n \n\n \"You heard her,\" you hear Rhiannon's voice say assuredly. \"Get out. You're barred, Martin.\"\n\n \n\n Martin glares over at her, breaking off from looking at you. A moment passes where you think he's going to leap over the bar. Instead, he turns and storms out.\n\n \n\n It takes a long time for people to resume their chatter. You look over to Rhiannon, watching her stern expression soften as she looks at you.\n\n \n\n \"You okay?\" she asks, her tone more gentle now.\n\n \n\n You nod, exhaling a shaky breath. \"Yeah. Thanks.\"\n\n \n\n \"Don’t thank me,\" she says, her lips quirking into a small smile. \"You handled yourself. Just... steer clear of him, alright? He’s not someone to mess with.\"\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n “Let me go!” you bark at him, trying to free yourself from his grasp.\n\n \n\n Martin just grins and pulls you tighter towards him. You push against his grip, squirming to get away from him. But his strength is just too much for you to overcome.\n\n \n\n “Think you should listen to the lady,” you hear a voice say from behind you. \n\n \n\n A hand reaches in and twists Martin’s arm, instantly forcing him to let go of you. You look up to see Clive, holding Martin back with one arm.\n\n \n\n “What’s the matter, Burtle?” Martin spits at him. “Got a soft spot for her?”\n\n \n\n Clive stares back at Martin, not flinching. “Go. Sit. Leave the girl alone.”\n\n \n\n Noise in the bar has fallen away to silence. You take a step back, free from Martin's grasp, looking between the two men facing off, each much taller than you. \n\n \n\n After a tense moment, Martin snorts and turns away. “Teasing slut,” he mutters as he walks back to his table.\n\n \n\n The tense atmosphere diffused, you hear conversation start up again and soon the bar returns to normal. Clive stands by you, only turning his eyes to you once Martin has sat back down.\n\n \n\n “You okay?” he asks you.\n\n \n\n You nod. “Thank you.”\n\n \n\n He gives you a sympathetic smile and turns to face you. “Best to avoid that one. The drink doesn’t mix well with him. Want my advice, though? Have an early night.”\n\n \n\n You follow Clive's gaze, straight to Martin. He grins at you, downing his beer.\n\n \n\n \"Go home, I reckon,\" Clive says, before returning to his own seat. With a final look towards Martin, you take his advice to heart and leave the tavern.\n\n \n “Let me go!” you bark at him, trying to free yourself from his grasp.\n\n \n\n Martin just grins and pulls you tighter towards him. You push against his grip, squirming to get away from him. But his strength is just too much for you to overcome.\n\n \n\n “That’s enough!” you hear Rhiannon shout from behind the bar, her playful demeanour evaporated and replaced with a serious and assertive tone far beyond her young age.\n\n \n\n “What’s the matter?” Martin asks her, mockingly, as his hand starts to grope at your waist. “She wants it.”\n\n \n\n “You want me to call my father?” Rhiannon replies. \n\n \n\n At that, Martin looks between you and Rhiannon, then relents and pushes you away. “Teasing slut,” he mutters as he walks back to his table.\n\n \n\n You give Rhiannon a look and she smiles sympathetically. Other patrons turn back to their conversations and quickly the bar returns to normal.\n\n \n\n \"Nice try,\" Rhiannon says, giving you a grin. \"Word from the girl who's seen it all before though. Get home early tonight. Before he drinks any more.\"\n\n \n\n You glance at Martin. He gives you a menacing smile and drains his drink.\n\n \n\n \"I think you're right,\" you tell Rhiannon. She nods as you quickly exit the pub.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n \n You take a deep breath, letting the magic gather in your chest before exhaling it in a steady stream toward Martin. The spell ripples through the air, settling over him as his sharp, predatory gaze locks onto you. For a moment, his expression twists, caught between his usual aggression and something softer, more malleable.\n\n \n\n \"Leave me alone, Martin,\" you tell him flatly.\n\n \n\n \"Well, well,\" he drawls, his voice dripping with false charm as he leans closer, his grin baring too many teeth. \"Didn’t know you had it in you. Makes you even more interesting.\" His hand twitches at his side, the tension in his stance betraying his restraint.\n\n \n\n \"You’re not getting what you want, Martin,\" you say firmly, keeping your voice calm but steady. \"Not now. Not ever.\"\n\n \n\n The charm spell keeps him off balance, his smirk faltering for a heartbeat before it returns, though there’s a faint glaze in his eyes now. \"Not now, huh?\" he repeats, his tone slower, almost amused. \"Fine. Play hard to get. Makes it more fun for me.\"\n\n \n\n His aggression seems to ebb, his hand falling to his side as he takes a step back, though his gaze remains fixed on you. \"But don’t think you’re off the hook,\" he adds, his voice dropping lower. \"Next time, we’ll see if you’re still so sure of yourself.\"\n\n \n\n You hold his gaze, refusing to back down, and he finally snorts, shaking his head. \"Alright, alright,\" he mutters, a mocking edge creeping back into his tone. \"Guess I’ll let you run this time. But you’d better believe I’m not done with you.\"\n\n \n\n He throws you one last glance, his crooked grin full of promise - or threat - before walking off.\n\n \n\n You exhale slowly, your heartbeat steadying as the space around you returns to normal. The charm spell held, but the unease of his lingering gaze stays with you. For now, you’ve managed to keep him at bay.\n\n \n Fail, as Martin doesn't have magic.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n \n You quickly inhale some air and focus on swelling magical energy through your lungs, before releasing the yellow gaseous aura into Martin's face.\n\n \n\n \"Don't touch me,\" you command.\n\n \n\n You see his eyes glaze over, as he looks between your face and your breasts. There is a hint of a frown on his face, but also a lazy grin. \"No?\" you hear him mutter.\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"No.\"\n\n \n\n He looks at you, his grin spreading. \"Alright then. I'll give you a pass today, darl'. Save it all up for another time.\"\n\n \n\n \"You should leave,\" you tell him. \"Before you upset me.\"\n\n \n\n His eyes narrow at hearing your words. \"Upset you...\"\n\n \n\n He shakes his head, trying to free his mind from the unseen fog from the spell. Blinking hard, he then chuckles.\n\n \n\n \"Alright, darl,\" he says, leering at you. \"Have it your way. But I'll be seeing you later.\"\n\n \n\n He throws you one last glance, his crooked grin full of promise - or threat - before walking off.\n\n \n\n You exhale slowly, your heartbeat steadying as the space around you returns to normal. The charm spell held, but the unease of his lingering gaze stays with you. For now, you’ve managed to keep him at bay.\n\n \n Fail, as Martin doesn't have magic.\n\n \n \n\n You are confident that you can now exit Fresh Pot without arousing suspicion. Alternatively, you know Flo will be unconscious for a while. You could work a shift as her at the coffee shop.\n \n\n *If you really wanted to.*\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n <>\n \n You freeze as Martin’s hands claw roughly at your chest, his fingers pushing against the fabric of your blouse, finding the edge of your bra. He forces the cup down, exposing the sensitive skin beneath. You gasp as his calloused fingers pinch your nipple through the raw cotton of your shirt.\n\n \n\n \"Like that, don’t you?\" he whispers into your ear, his breath hot and invasive.\n\n \n\n Your lips part, but no sound comes out. Your body stiffens, every nerve on edge as he continues his assault. Even as you try to will yourself to pull away, your body betrays you, reacting to the harsh stimulation. His rough grip tightens, sending an unbidden shiver through you.\n\n \n\n Martin smirks against your neck, one hand still working your breast while the other snakes down, sliding between your thighs. His touch is invasive, prizing your legs apart and moving upward, hiking your skirt with every motion. \"You’re not stopping me,\" he murmurs, his tone laced with dark amusement. \"Guess that means you like it.\"\n\n \n\n \"Don’t…\" you whisper faintly, your voice trembling.\n\n \n\n He chuckles, his hand pushing further up your thigh, his dominance overwhelming every sense. Then the bell above the shop door rings sharply, breaking the tension like a thunderclap. You glance over your shoulder to see Ron Denver standing in the doorway, a grocery box balanced under his arm, sweat dotting his brow.\n\n \n\n Martin releases you instantly, stepping back with an infuriatingly smug grin. You turn around, smoothing your skirt instinctively as Ron’s hard gaze meets yours.\n\n \n\n \"I think you should get to work,\" Ron tells Martin, his voice gruff. Martin smirks, brushing past you as he moves toward the counter. \"I’ll see you later, Flo,\" he mutters before disappearing out the door.\n\n \n\n You’re left standing there, the silence in the café heavy and suffocating. Ron sets the groceries on the counter, his gaze lingering on you before he speaks again. \"Get the lunch orders ready. And… fix yourself up.\" He nods toward the mirror behind the counter before leaving.\n\n \n\n You glance at your reflection, your blouse wrinkled and caught on the edge of your bra. The image staring back at you feels wrong, like someone else entirely. Your hand trembles as you adjust your clothes.\n\n \n\n *Was this what you wanted? Did it feel… good?*\n\n \n\n The thought makes your stomach churn. Doesn't it?\n\n \n\n You are confident that you can now exit Fresh Pot without arousing suspicion. Alternatively, you know Flo will be unconscious for a while. You could work a shift as her at the coffee shop.\n \n\n *If you really wanted to.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n <>\n\n You stand frozen as Martin’s hand moves roughly over your chest, his fingers clawing at the fabric of your blouse. He pushes against the edge of your bra, trying to force it down, but your tense posture makes it awkward. He frowns, his frustration mounting as he grabs at you harder.\n\n \n\n \"What’s this?\" he growls, his voice a mix of annoyance and mockery. \"You’re going stiff on me, Flo? Don’t act like you don’t want it.\" His grip tightens, and you gasp - not from pleasure, but from the roughness of his touch.\n\n \n\n \"I...\" you start, but your voice falters, barely audible over his heavy breathing.\n\n \n\n Martin’s scowl deepens, his hand moving down to your waist, trying to pull your hips closer. But your body resists instinctively, and he growls low in his throat. \"What’s your problem?\" he snaps. \"You think I’ve got all day for this?\"\n\n \n\n Just then, the shop doorbell rings, the sound cutting through the tension. You look up to see Ron Denver entering, a grocery box under his arm and his brow furrowed.\n\n \n\n Martin releases you abruptly, muttering under his breath as he steps back. \"Waste of my time,\" he snarls, shooting you a glare before turning toward Ron.\n\n \n\n Ron’s eyes flick between the two of you, his expression hardening as he addresses Martin. \"Get to work,\" he says curtly. Martin smirks but obeys, brushing past you on his way to the counter. \"Don’t tease next time, Flo,\" he says with a mocking sneer before disappearing out the door.\n\n \n\n The silence that follows feels like a weight pressing on your chest. Ron drops the groceries on the counter, giving you a pointed look. \"Lunch orders. Now. And fix your clothes,\" he says, his voice rough. He nods toward the mirror behind the counter before turning to leave.\n\n \n\n You glance at your reflection, your blouse rumpled and caught in your bra. The image is disheveled and uncomfortable, a stark reminder of what just happened. As you adjust your clothes, a bitter thought crosses your mind. Was this all you could do?\n \n \n\n You are confident that you can now exit Fresh Pot without arousing suspicion. Alternatively, you know Flo will be unconscious for a while. You could work a shift as her at the coffee shop.\n \n\n *If you really wanted to.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n <>\n \n \"Take your hands off me!\" you snap, twisting sharply in Martin’s grip and slamming your elbow into his stomach with all the force you can muster.\n\n \n\n Martin grunts, his grip faltering as he stumbles back a step. You spin around to face him, glaring up at his looming frame. Despite the size difference, you plant your feet firmly, refusing to let him intimidate you.\n\n \n\n \"Try that again, Martin,\" you say, your voice steady and sharp, \"and I’ll make sure you regret it.\"\n\n \n\n His expression twists with rage, and for a moment, it looks like he’s about to lunge at you. But then something in your tone - or maybe the fire in your eyes - gives him pause. His sneer fades into an annoyed scowl, and he rubs at his stomach where your elbow landed.\n\n \n\n \"You’ve got a big mouth, don’t you?\" he mutters, his tone dripping with venom. \"Think you’re so tough, huh?\"\n\n \n\n \"I don’t think,\" you fire back, standing tall despite the tension thick in the air. \"I know. And if you even think about laying a hand on me again, you’ll find out exactly how tough I am.\"\n\n \n\n Martin’s jaw tightens, his eyes narrowing as he looks you up and down. For a long moment, the room is silent, the weight of his gaze heavy and dangerous. Then, suddenly, the shop doorbell rings, breaking the standoff like a thunderclap.\n\n \n\n You glance toward the door to see Ron Denver, a grocery box under his arm, stepping inside with a scowl on his face. \"What the hell’s going on here?\" Ron grumbles, his eyes flicking between you and Martin.\n\n \n\n Martin straightens, his expression shifting into a feigned nonchalance. \"Just having a chat with Florence,\" he says, his smirk reappearing. \"Didn’t know she was so feisty.\"\n\n \n\n Ron’s frown deepens as he steps further into the shop. \"Get to work, Martin,\" he says curtly, jerking his head toward the door. The bell rings again as he opens it for him.\n\n \n\n Martin hesitates, his glare flicking back to you one last time. \"This isn’t over,\" he mutters, but the threat in his tone lacks its usual edge. He brushes past you, muttering curses under his breath, and steps out into the street.\n\n \n\n Ron sets the groceries on the counter, giving you a hard but not unsympathetic look. \"Standing up to him, now?\" he mutters gruffly. \"You better fix yourself up and get back to work.\"\n\n \n\n You glance at the mirror behind the counter. Your blouse is rumpled, your face flushed, but your reflection shows more than just disarray. You see strength there - your own. As you smooth your clothes and steady your breath, a small, determined smile creeps onto your lips. Martin won’t try this again.\n\n \n\n You are confident that you can now exit Fresh Pot without arousing suspicion. Alternatively, you know Flo will be unconscious for a while. You could work a shift as her at the coffee shop.\n \n\n *If you really wanted to.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n <>\n\n \"Take your hands off of me!\" you shout as you thrust your elbow back into his stomach.\n\n \n\n Martin yelps and involuntarily eases his grip on your body. You seize the moment, pushing him back and ducking under his arms.\n\n \n\n \"You'll pay for that, bitch,\" Martin says flatly, looking at you.\n\n \n\n Backed up against the benchtop opposite the counter, you stare up at him. You see the rage in his glare and the aggression in his snarl. He looks down on you, almost a foot taller than your current form.\n\n \n\n \"Get out,\" you say to him, with strength in your voice in spite of your lip trembling.\n\n \n\n You watch as his eyes flick up and down your body. He doesn't move. A grin spreads across his face.\n\n \n\n Suddenly the bell rings out as the door opens and you spin around to see the sweaty owner, Ron Denver, entering with a grocery box under his arm. \"Goddamn this weather...\" he says before seeing the situation unfolding in his shop.\n\n \n\n \"What are you doing behind the counter, Martin?\" Ron asks him.\n\n \n\n \"Just spending some quality time with the lady,\" Martin replies.\n\n \n\n Ron's eyes dart between you and Martin, narrowing. \"You should get to work,\" he tells Martin. The bell rings again as he opens the door for him.\n\n \n\n After a long moment, Martin sighs and walks around the counter. He flashes you a grin as he moves by. \"I'll see you later, babe,\" he says as he leaves.\n\n \n\n There is a long moment of silence as the door closes behind him. Ron looks at you, offering the closest to a sympathetic smile you've ever seen in Charlton.\n\n \n\n He puts the box down on the counter. \"Here's the bread for the sandwiches. I've got to go to the town hall. Get to work.\"\n\n \n\n You nod silently, and Ron exits, leaving you alone in the shop.\n \n \n\n You are confident that you can now exit Fresh Pot without arousing suspicion. Alternatively, you know Flo will be unconscious for a while. You could work a shift as her at the coffee shop.\n\n \n\n *If you really wanted to.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n <>\n\n Your heart is pounding as you force yourself to step forward, every high-heeled stride a reminder of how exposed you feel.\n\n \n\n “C’mon Phillips, don’t be shy!” he shouts again, his tone growing more insistent. He's slowed down to a crawl, matching your pace even as you speed up as best you can in the heeled boots.\n\n \n\n You try not to meet his eye, instead looking forward. You feel the weight of every exposed inch of your legs and every unnatural sway in your movements. Over the clip-clopping of your heels is the sound of the purring engine from Martin's delivery van. Menacing. A threat.\n\n \n\n \"Feeling shy, are ya'?\" you hear his bellow. \"Don't worry about that, darl'. Come see me one night at McTafeys. A few drinks will loosen you up.\"\n\n \n\n Again, you ignore his words. Finally, you hear the van's engine purr and Martin speeds up, leaving you alone walking the street once more.\n\n \n\n You continue walking along the street, feeling your body shaking from the unwanted attention. More aware of the dangers Charlton poses to women.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Your body jolts as your eyes finally meet his, and for a moment, the vulnerability surging through you transforms into raw defiance. Every high-heeled stride, though still making you feel exposed, now carries the weight of your refusal to be objectified. The familiar crunch of your boots on the pavement punctuates the tension as Martin’s crude voice slices through the night air once more.\n\n \n\n You force yourself to stop as your heart races. With a tremor of anger and resolve, you spin to face the van and shout back, “In your dreams! I’m not here for your lecherous games, Martin!”\n\n \n\n There’s a brief, charged silence before his coarse laughter slithers through the open window. “Oh, so you’ve got some bite now, huh?” he sneers, the challenge clear in his tone. The retort hangs heavy in the air as you stand there exposed, vulnerable. Yet unyielding.\n\n \n\n \"Go find your entertainment at the bottom of a bottle,\" you spit. \"I hear that men that drink like you do can't do much else.\"\n\n \n\n \"You little...\" Martin spits, but is interrupted by a driver coming up behind him, honking their horn. \"I'll be seeing you, I'm sure,\" he mutters, eying you darkly. Then with a dramatic curse, he slams his foot on the accelerator and speeds off.\n\n \n\n You continue your walk. The echo of his mocking tone lingers, but with each determined step you take down the street, you feel a growing strength that pushes back against the intrusive threat.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Your heart stutters as Martin’s lecherous call slices through the air. For a breathless moment, the cool wind on your bare legs and the tight press of your high heels fade into the background as his voice - raw and provocative - fills your mind.\n\n \n\n A shiver of excitement runs through you, mingling with the awareness of your own vulnerability. Despite knowing full well that Martin’s words are nothing more than crude flirtation, a thrill pulses beneath your skin. “Maybe I will…” you murmur softly, your voice betraying a mix of nervous delight and forbidden daring. In that instant, the dangerous allure of being the center of his unwanted attention sends butterflies careening through you.\n\n \n\n “Good answer, darlin’!” Martin bellows back, his words dripping with a mix of mockery and promise. “You know, you should swing by McTafey’s later. Maybe let me show you just how big the back of this van really is.” His invitation is as brazen as it is unsettling, a crude dare that leaves your pulse racing even as you recoil internally at the implications.\n\n \n\n You force a breathy laugh, replying with a touch of coyness, “I’ve got somewhere to be, but maybe… we’ll run into each other later.” You find yourself giving him a smile as he chuckles.\n\n \n\n \"Count on it,\" he says, before his van roars away, the sound of its engine fading, leaving you standing there, heart pounding and thoughts in tumult. The encounter - a mix of illicit thrill and a stark reminder of how exposed you are - continues to echo in your mind.\n\n \n\n Alone once more on the quiet street, you walk with a tentative mix of exhilaration and caution. That dangerous, alluring spark of flirtation with Martin’s crude advances still tingles on your skin, tempting you to stray further from what you know is right.\n\n \n\n It’s just harmless flirting, you tell yourself. You wouldn't really go see him later, would you?\n\n \n\n Would you?\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Teenage boy’s bedrooms can always do with a clean.”\n\n \n\n \n \n *Success! Jennifer seems to be tutoring Terrence for his biology classes on Sunday mornings in the library.

Or at least, not so much.”\n\n \n\n \n \n *Success! Jennifer seems to be tutoring Terrence for his biology classes on Sunday mornings in the library.

Quite a few outings with different young men, I hear.” She casts a disapproving glance past you, as if Annie might be lurking in the shadows. “Those skirts she wears… far shorter than I’d ever have dared at her age.”\n\n \n\n Her voice softens to a whisper. “I wouldn’t want Terrence bringing home someone like that. He needs someone who knows her way around a home. More of a homemaker, if you will.” She pauses, then adds with unintended sharpness, “It’s a shame you’re taken, Jennifer. Otherwise I’d have set him up in a heartbeat.”\n\n \n\n *A wave of queasiness washes over you as Mary’s well-meaning joke settles in your stomach.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n You fold your arms, meeting Mary’s eyes. “Honestly, Mary, I’m not convinced this biology tutoring is doing Terrence much good.”\n\n \n\n Her brow lifts in surprise. “He’s improving,” she insists, voice firm. “He’s more confident each week.”\n\n \n\n You press on, voice steady. “Perhaps it’s the setting. I don’t think it’s conducive to education.”\n\n \n\n Mary gives you a strange look. “You think that… about the library? How can the library not be conducive to education?”\n\n \n\n You hold back a smile, if only to try and justify how strange your statement sounded. “Maybe it’s overwhelming Terrence,” you say. “All that knowledge. It could be intimidating.” An eyebrow is raised in your direction, as you feel yourself digging yourself into a hole. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll persevere.”\n\n \n\n The receptionist looks at you curiously. Mary might be giving you a strange look, but you got what you needed out of it.\n\n \n\n \n \n *Success!

I wouldn’t give up yet.”\n\n \n\n You shrug, unable to find the right words to explain your doubts. Mary’s confident nod tells you she’s closing the conversation. The location of the tutoring remains unspoken.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n You clear your throat and choose your words carefully. “Mary, has Terrence shown any… interest in girls lately?”\n\n \n\n Her practiced smile falters for a heartbeat, worry flickering behind her eyes before she masks it again. “He’s very focused on his studies,” she replies softly. “Honestly, I doubt he’s given dating much thought.”\n\n \n\n You press a finger to your lips, leaning in slightly. “Are you sure? A boy his age…”\n\n \n\n Mary exhales, gaze drifting toward the frosted door. When she meets your eyes again, her voice is gentler. “It’s been such a relief that he’s grown so fond of your company. I admit, I was worried for a time. About him. But seeing how he’s taking to you…” \n\n \n\n She offers you a small, wistful smile. “So just indulging a little crush isn’t the worst thing, is it? He just needed the quiet space away from other people to come out of his shell. Looks like he’s a little shy with his feelings. Thankfully.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n You nod along with Mary. “I think the quiet space is good for him too.”\n\n \n\n Mary smiles, eyes softening. “Absolutely. It’s perfect. None of the troublesome boys from school dare set foot in the library. The footballers won’t bother him there.”\n\n \n\n Her smile broadens. “And if they did, they’d find him in the company of a lovely young lady. Surely that would be enough to silence their teasing.”\n\n \n\n \n \n *Success! Jennifer seems to be tutoring Terrence for his biology classes on Sunday mornings in the library.

Emily’s lucky, I don’t have a brother to help me study.” \n\n \n\n You notice she’s blushing slightly. “I’m sure you’re doing alright.”\n\n \n\n She smiles, politely. “I hope so,” she says. “I don’t want to be a high-school drop-out.”\n\n \n\n \"Are the teachers helping you?\" you ask carefully.\n\n \n\n \"Yes,\" she says quietly. \"They are.\" But with you, she doesn’t elaborate. \n \n \n \"How are you finding school?\" you ask, trying to avoid drawing her suspicion.\n\n \n\n “I’m getting by,” she says without confidence. “Things seem to be a lot harder than they were at Middle School. It’s so hard to keep focused sometimes.”\n\n \n\n Her cheerful demeanour slips for a moment as she reflects. Then her smile returns. “At least the teachers are helpful. Mr. Rogers is especially supportive. If you’re struggling with Maths, you should ask him if he can give you extra lessons too.”\n\n \n\n You smile politely, but offer no encouragement to the idea. “Don’t you find the school to be… odd?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She looks back at you, frowning. “It’s a bit musty and old fashioned, if that’s what you mean?”\n\n \n\n “Nothing weird?” you try. “Out of the ordinary?” \n\n \n\n She looks at you curiously. “Only this conversation, Em,” she replies, the volume of her voice dropping. “You should be careful when you talk like that. I heard there was a cheerleader last year who started making some funny comments. Accusations. There’s a reason there’s an open spot on the team now.”\n\n \n\n Michelle flashes a grin and giggles. “Which works out well for you or me, at least! Have you thought about trying out?”\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “How are your after school lessons going with Mr. Rogers?” you ask.\n\n \n\n Her face lights up and she hurriedly begins to talk. “They are amazing! Mr. Rogers is such a good teacher. I think I’d be failing if it wasn’t for him. Maths is so hard. Numbers and equations just don’t stick in my head like they used to.”\n\n \n\n “What do you do after school?” you reply. \n\n \n\n She raises an eyebrow and her impish grin spreads across her face. “Why the interest? Are you jealous, Em? Or do you need some private tuition too?”\n\n \n\n Without waiting for a response, she leans in and whispers. “Believe me, it’s worth it. There are special privileges to being one of his favourites. He even gave me a key to the Maths room, so I can go in and wait for him. Undisturbed.”\n\n \n\n \n \n \"I can read your mind, Emily Phillips,\" Michelle says as you pause. She grins. \"I'm not giving you that key unless you come to cheerleader practice with me.\"\n\n \n\n She smirks as she watches you. \"Oh come on, Em. Where's your sense of fun? Please!\"\n\n \n\n You sigh and she giggles. \"Remember. I'll see you on the pitch in the evening.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n “Mr. Rogers told me not to. He’d probably punish me if I gave it to you. Not that I’d mind much.” She winks.\n\n \n\n \"You did help me out trying out for the cheerleader team,\" she says, mulling over her decision.\n\n \n\n Suddenly Michelle breaks out into a smile. \"Alright, why not! I wouldn't want to deny you some private tutorage, after all.\"\n\n \n\n Michelle reaches into her bag and takes out a key, handing it to you with a knowing smile.\n\n \n\n \"Enjoy,\" she murmurs. \"I'm sure you will.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n “Do you think I could borrow that key?” you ask her. She smiles, conspiratorially. “Oh Emily, I knew you had it in you.” \n\n \n\n “Mr. Rogers told me not to. He’d probably punish me if I gave it to you. Not that I’d mind much.” She winks. “But it would be enough that I’d want something for the trouble.”\n\n \n\n “What do you have in mind?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She eyes for a moment, then her face practically erupts in excitement. “Let’s try out for the cheerleaders together!” she beams. “Oh my god, Em, can you imagine us two being on the team? We’d have so much fun.”\n\n \n\n “You want to try out for the cheerleaders?” you ask back to her. \n\n \n\n She nods and squeals. “Yes! If you at least try, I’ll give you the key. Who knows, Emily - you might even enjoy it!”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n “What do you think about Jake?” you ask her. \n\n \n\n She gives you a look. “As in?” She waits a moment for a reply, but you don’t offer one. “Isn’t he dating Christina?” she whispers. “Why do you want to know?”\n\n \n\n “I spoke to him,” you tell her. “He’s having some problems. Christina isn’t there for him. I thought you might be interested in him?”\n\n \n\n Michelle’s eyes twinkle. “Are you setting me up for a fling, Em?” She giggles. “You slutty little madam. I’m surprised you didn’t want to jump his bones.”\n\n \n\n “I can tell him if you’re keen,” you continue.\n\n \n\n There’s a glint to her look. “I mean, he is hot.” She bites her lip. “But no. He’s with Christina. If she found out, she’d end me.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n \n <>\n\n “Hey Michelle,” you say, inflating your voice over the din of the cafeteria. “Does your dad know his little girl is one of the teacher’s after-school slut?”\n\n \n\n Silence envelops the room almost as quickly as the colour fades from Michelle’s face. She looks over at you, her small lips open with shock.\n\n \n\n You look around the cafeteria, playing to the audience. Everyone is watching you, waiting on your words. \n\n \n\n “Don’t act so surprised, ‘shell,” you tell her. “We all know what you do with Mr. Rogers to keep your grades up.”\n\n \n\n You watch as tears fill her eyes. She shakes her head, silently, trying to persuade you from continuing.\n\n \n\n “You’re an embarrassment to this school,” you spit. “You whore.”\n\n \n\n The silence from the other students is broken as someone joins in. “Whore!” \n\n \n\n The cafeteria fills with dozens of voices, a gaggle of students all mercilessly chanting the same word at Michelle. “Whore. Whore. Whore!”\n\n \n\n Bursting into tears, Michelle grabs her things and runs out of the hall, accompanied only by the spiteful laughter of her peers.\n\n \n\n You watch her go, then look around at the students already making jokes and comments about Michelle. She might never speak to you again, but you have certainly displayed your position in the school pecking order. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You make small talk with Michelle, who has a knack for steering conversation back to cheerleading and how much she wants to join the squad. She talks passionately and at length about the subject, making it easy to hide how alien this situation is for you. \n\n \n\n Time soon passes and you hear the bell go for the end of lunchtime. You say your goodbyes to Michelle, who flashes you a friendly smile and assures you that she'll see you later.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Alright, I’ll see you there,” you tell her. She squeals.\n\n \n\n “Oh gosh, Emily. We’re going to have so much fun! I’m sure once we audition, Christina will see that we both belong on the team!\"\n\n \n\n She leans in and hugs you. The sensation of an attractive young woman pulling you close to her is mentally jarring as you feel your breasts are squeezed as you come together.\n\n \n\n “I’ll meet you on the football field after school,” she says. “I can’t wait!” \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I’m not sure I want to join the cheerleading team,” you say. \n\n \n\n Michelle pouts. “Come on, Emily! This is important to me! Please!”\n\n \n\n You shake your head, but smile apologetically. She huffs.\n\n \n\n “Fine. Let me know if you change your mind.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Come on, Michelle,” you say soothingly. “What’s worse, risking Christina’s wrath or facing the prospect that your extracurricular studies with Mr. Rogers are known by the whole school.”\n\n \n\n Michelle’s eyebrows narrow. \"What?\" she stammers.\n\n \n\n “I need Jake’s help,” you continue. “And he needs some relief. If he’s not relieved, I don’t get my help. And if that were to happen, I wouldn’t know what I would do. Or rather, what I would say and to whom.”\n\n \n\n Realisation dawns on Michelle’s face. “Emily. You wouldn’t.”\n\n \n\n “I need Jake’s help, Michelle,” you reply. “And you’re going to get it for me.”\n\n \n\n The strawberry blonde teenager shakes her head, her eyes wide with fear. “Emily. You wouldn’t do that to me. We’re friends.”\n\n \n\n You nod, keeping your voice neutral. “And friends help each other out. Help me out, Michelle, so Jake can help me.”\n\n \n\n “But you’re blackmailing me!” Michelle blurts out.\n\n \n\n You hesitate. Here’s Emily’s best friend. Her only real friend at this school that you know of. Until this moment full of trust. And you are piece by piece ripping that friendship to pieces.\n\n \n\n “This is too important, Michelle. I need Jake’s help.”\n\n \n\n Michelle’s nose turns up, a rare scowl on her brow. “You bitch.”\n\n \n\n “Is that a yes?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She looks at you with hatred. “Fine. I don’t have a choice.” \n\n \n\n You sigh and nod. “Alright, I’ll tell him you’ll meet him under the bleachers after school.”\n\n \n\n You stand up from the table and pick up your satchel. “I’m sorry it came to this, for what it’s worth.”\n\n \n\n “Fuck you,” Michelle spits back.\n\n \n\n You decide to leave her alone.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “What if I could have a word with Christina?” you say. “Get her to reconsider you for the cheerleading team.”\n\n \n\n Michelle’s mouth drops open, before closing into a broad smile. “You think you could get her to do that?” \n\n \n\n “We’ve become quite close,” you reply. “I think she would listen to me. Plus, it would be fun for us both to be cheerleaders. Like you said.”\n\n \n\n You can almost see the conflict in Michelle’s mind play out over her face. “Yes! But - if Christina found out…”\n\n \n\n “Why would she find out?” you ask. “The reason Jake wants someone else is all she cares about is cheerleading. She’s too consumed with the cheerleaders to even consider what Jake is up to. Plus, like you said he is hot.”\n\n \n\n Michelle nods. Her face fixes in a coy smile. “Very hot,” she murmurs. \n\n \n\n A long moment goes by as she makes up her mind. “Alright, I’m in. How naughty, Em. And you, you’re like a little pimp, you skank.” She giggles a little and you see warmth in her face.\n\n \n\n “I’ll let Jake know you’ll meet him under the bleachers after school,” you tell her, standing. “Then next time at practice, I’ll put in a word for you.”\n\n \n\n Michelle nods and titters. “I’m looking forward to it.”\n\n \n\n You smile. Time to tell Jake you’ve found someone for him.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You give the young woman a long hard look. She glares back at you. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n Drawing down inside your body, you feel your magical energies stir on call. You take a deep breath, feeling your arcane reservoir in your torso pull down the air under the surface, bathing your breath in their mystical properties.\n \n\n Michelle eyes you darkly. You sense her tensing up. She can't suspect what's about to come, but it's almost like her fight or flight mode is about to kick in.\n\n \n\n And for good reason, you admit. The Charm spell might sound simple and breezy, but like with all magic you've encountered so far, it's based in overwriting the memories and the mind. Effectively, you're rewriting Michelle's memories, just so she's nicer to you for a while.\n\n \n\n *Is messing with people's minds so nonchalantly something you're fine with now?*\n\n \n\n You breathe out quickly, seeing your breath glowing with yellow and orange gaseous mist. It sweeps over Michelle, seemingly unaware that she's breathing in something out of the ordinary.\n\n \n\n She blinks once. Twice. Then her glare dissipates, replaced by a familiar smile. \"Sorry!\" she giggles. \"I got distracted. What were we talking about?\"\n\n \n Something is wrong with the code, as Michelle has no magic.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I'm sure you could just give me the key,” you purr. \"After all, we wouldn't want loose lips to spread rumours of your after school sessions with Mr. Rogers.”\n\n \n\n Michelle freezes, her confident demeanor cracking. \"What... what are you talking about?\" she asks, her voice tight and sharp. Her eyes dart around, scanning for eavesdroppers.\n\n \n\n \"You’ve been staying late after school a lot,\" you say, letting the words hang in the air. \"I'm sure other people have noticed.\"\n\n \n\n Her face flushes crimson, and she draws herself up as if to refute you, but the words don’t come. Instead, she hisses, \"You wouldn't!\"\n\n \n\n You step closer, lowering your voice. \"Maybe I wouldn't. But what about everyone else? That’s the problem with rumors, isn’t it? They spread fast.\"\n\n \n\n Michelle glares at you, her hands balling into fists at her sides. \"You’re disgusting, you know that? I thought you were my friend.\"\n\n \n\n You say nothing. She swallows hard.\n\n \n\n \"Fine. You win. Here.\" She pulls the Maths room key from her bag and shoves it into your hand with more force than necessary.\n\n \n\n Her gaze is venomous, her voice cutting. \"Take it, but if you breathe a word of this to anyone, I swear you’ll regret it.\"\n\n \n\n She stands and turns sharply, her heels clicking against the floor as she storms off, leaving the faint scent of her floral perfume lingering in the air.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “You keeping up with the classes?” you ask, watching her closely.\n\n \n\n Michelle blinks, startled by the question. “Oh. Um. Yeah. They’re fine,” she says quickly. Her hands fold on her tray, and she forces a smile. “It’s all… the way it should be, right?”\n\n \n\n Her eyes flick sideways, toward the cheerleaders’ table. “I mean, I’m working hard. Trying out for the squad, too. Christina’s always saying dedication is what matters most. I… I just hope she notices me.” She laughs lightly, too quick. “Anyway, I’m sure the teachers know what they’re doing.”\n\n \n\n Her words are deferential, eager to sound agreeable, but underneath you can hear the tension.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “How’s school going, Michelle?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She straightens in her chair almost reflexively. “Good. It’s good,” she says brightly. The words sound rehearsed. “Keeping up, staying on top of things.”\n\n \n\n There’s the faintest pause before she adds more softly, “It’s a lot sometimes. But I’m fine. Everyone’s busy this year.” Her smile flickers, then steadies again. “I’ll manage.”\n\n \n\n \"Nothing strange going on?\" you try.\n\n \n\n That's enough to bring a smirk to her face. \"Other than the school quarterback suddenly paying me some interest?\" She glances back to Christina, then raises an eyebrow. \"I didn't think you knew who I was.\"\n\n \n\n You don't reply, watching as Michelle smiles sweetly up at you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “What do you think about me?” you ask her directly.\n\n \n\n Michelle freezes. Her lips part, then close again. A flush rises to her cheeks as she fiddles with a curl of hair, avoiding your eyes.\n\n \n\n “You’re… Jake,” she says finally, with a nervous laugh. “I don't need to boost your ego, do I?\"\n\n \n\n \"I know who I am,\" you say, words coming quickly. \"But what do you think about me?\"\n\n \n\n A trace of red forms on Michelle's cheeks. \"Christina’s lucky.” She bites her lip, then glances quickly toward the cheerleaders’ table. “And I’m not crazy enough to say more than that.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “What about you, Michelle?” you ask suddenly. “What do you want?”\n\n \n\n Her eyes widen, as though no one’s ever asked her that before. She lets out a small, nervous laugh. “Me? I… I don’t know. To keep my grades up, not screw up my exams. Maybe get onto the cheer squad. That’d be something, wouldn’t it?”\n\n \n\n Her voice falters, and for a moment you see her looking back at you, waiting for a comment. There's a brightness to her eyes, but mixed with scared vulnerability as she bites into her bottom lip.\n\n \n\n When you don't reply, her gaze flicks quickly back toward Christina and the other cheerleaders. The spark in her eyes dims.\n\n \n\n “I’m fine where I am,” she finishes, forcing a smile. But her blush betrays her.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “How are your after-school lessons with Mr. Rogers?” you ask, keeping your voice low.\n\n \n\n The colour drains from Michelle’s face. Her fork clatters softly against her tray as she shakes her head. “I... I don’t know what you mean.”\n\n \n\n When you don’t reply, she leans forward, voice urgent. “Please, Jake. Don’t say that. Not here. People… people talk.” Her eyes dart around the cafeteria as if expecting everyone to be listening.\n\n \n\n “I just need the extra help, that’s all,” she insists quickly. “Nothing else.” Her laugh is brittle, unconvincing. “It’s not even worth mentioning.”\n\n \n\n Her hands are trembling faintly against the table. Whatever else she feels about you, she is terrified of what you could do with this.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "“Where did you get those photos?” you ask him directly. \n\n \n\n Olaf’s eyes flick for a moment from you to the photos. When his eyes return, he smiles sardonically. “Some I take. Some Dennis takes. Lots of sluts at this school. Lots that will pose for photos.”\n\n \n\n His eyes wander over your body, but his expression is cold and hard.\n\n \n You clear your throat, trying to sound casual. “What about photos?”\n\n \n\n Olaf’s grin widens, yellow teeth catching in the low light. He leans forward, spitting on the ground between his boots.\n\n \n\n “Our deal,” he rasps. “You give me snaps. I give you keys. Access to places you shouldn’t be going. Then you tuck your camera into dark corners. See what no one else sees.”\n\n \n\n His eyes glimmer with a knowing leer. “And I get my souvenirs. For ma' keys. So, you got something for me?”\n\n \n\n For a moment, your mind flicks to the photograph of Emily tucked away in your bag. But you couldn't trade Olaf for it. You won't be able to transform into Dennis.\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “I don’t have any more.”\n\n \n\n Olaf snorts, disappointed, and leans back against the wall. “Come back when you’ve got swapsies,” he sneers. His stained fingernail scrapes idly at the boiler pipe, as though he’s already lost interest.\n\n \n “You take all these?” you ask, gesturing to the wall of photos.\n\n \n\n Olaf’s jaw tightens. His eyes flick from you to the pictures, then back again. “Some,” he mutters. “None of your business.\"\n\n \n\n \"What is this - a private collection?\" you ask, a hint of hostility creeping into your voice.\n\n \n\n \"Don’t pretend you don’t enjoy the view,” Olaf spits back. “Quarterbacks get their kicks. I just get what they see.”\n\n \n\n \"I bet the teachers wouldn't like it, if they found out,\" you reply, smirking at him.\n\n \n\n But instead of growing wary at your subtle threat, he sniggers. \"Teachers don't care what I do here. Helps them, even. Identifying the sluts of the year.\"\n\n \n\n Olaf glances back at the photos and you see you've temporarily lost him to daydreams.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I was exploring and I got lost,” you say, almost convincingly. \n\n \n\n Olaf snorts. “Lots of girls get lost down here,” he tells you. “Lots of sluts. Looking for things they shouldn’t be. Luckily, I help. Me and my keys.”\n\n \n\n He reaches down to his belt and pulls out a set of keys on a retractable piece of wire. He jangles them in front of you. You see that almost every key for every room in the school is on there.\n\n \n\n “These get you lost in places you want to go,” he adds, letting the keys go. With a flurry of wire recoiling, the keys swoosh back against his belt. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “Dennis takes some of these photos?” you ask Olaf, glancing at some of the voyeuristic shots. \n\n \n\n “Mmhmm,” Olaf mumbles, nodding. “Gets in gaps in the building. I give him keys. He takes photos.”\n\n \n\n You glance at the selection of photos pinned on the wall. Photos captured in the gym. The changing rooms. The toilets.\n\n \n\n “That’s disgusting,” you can’t help but say.\n\n \n\n “Sluts know what they're doing,” Olaf tells you. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Dennis been down here too?” you ask.\n\n \n\n Olaf’s eyes narrow, the grime in his face deepening with the scowl. “Dennis wanders everywhere. He’s a rat. That’s all.” \n\n \n\n \"And how does he wander around?\" you ask, trying to coax something out of the greasy janitor.\n\n \n\n His voice drops lower, muttered. “Not my business to keep track of him. Not yours either. Leave Dennis alone.\"\n\n \n\n You feel a small smirk creep up from your mouth. Words forming again, without you registering them. \"And if I don't?\"\n\n \n\n He glares back at you. \"Photos have a habit of appearing in public places. Cheerleaders, especially.\"\n\n \n\n He coughs a gravelly chuckle to himself.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n\n \n You look at the wall again, noting the spread of photos that show students, in this very alcove, posing in increasingly lurid ways.\n\n \n\n “What do you mean, pose for photos?”\n\n \n\n Olaf flashes you a half-cocked smile, exposing his broken and chipped teeth. “No one forces them,” he says, nodding his head back to the wall. “Sluts come down here. Want me and my keys. Get them into places they don’t belong. Just want their photos.”\n\n \n\n You look back at the photospreads, noticing how the girls all look into the camera, pulling faces of arousal and desire. Some are more convincing than others. “You take those photos?”\n\n \n\n He grins at you, void of empathy. “They love it. But you’d love it too.”\n\n \n You glance at the wall again, rows of girls staring back from lurid poses. \"So some of these girls pose for you?\"\n\n \n\n “Some of them,” Olaf mutters. “They want to. Think it gets them something. No one forces them.”\n\n \n\n You throw the janitor a look. \"And they're okay with the photos you take?\"\n\n \n\n He scratches at his jaw, tone flat. “They know what they’re doing. Sluts always do.”\n\n \n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n \n You glance down at the large set of keys attached to his belt. “So,” you begin. “You’d give me a key, if I pose for you too?”\n\n \n\n Olaf smirks at you. “I unlock any door. Me and my keys. I give you a key when you pose. Like the other sluts who wanted favours.”\n\n \n\n You look at the photos on the wall to remind you of what Olaf expects from you. Though you can tell there are varying levels of enthusiasm, each photoshoot is scandalous. These are the sort of photos that would ruin reputations, if they were made public. If you were to go through with this, they’d be pictures of your sister out there too.\n\n \n\n Then there is the very fact that you would be the one Olaf was taking photos of. A common thread is apparent throughout them. Each of the girls slowly strip. Each of them pose submissively. And each makes sure the camera sees as much as it can.\n\n \n\n Do you really need a key this badly to do this, you think.\n\n \n\n Or do you actually want to?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n You begin to ask Olaf about his keys again, but he shakes his head. “Already got you,” he tells you, gesturing back to the wall. There, sure enough, is the spread of photos that Olaf took of you. \n\n \n\n You wince as you see the images of your sister posing for Olaf’s camera. Photos that, if they got out, would ruin her reputation forever.\n\n \n\n “No more keys for you,” he tells you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You glance down at the heavy set of keys clipped to his belt. “Can I borrow some keys?”\n\n \n\n Olaf’s hand drops to cover them almost instinctively. “Staff keys,” he growls. “Not for you lot. Never were.” \n\n \n\n He turns his head and spits, as if to end the conversation.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n “Alright,” you tell Olaf. “I’ll do it.”\n\n \n\n A sly grin spreads across the janitor's face. “Sluts all the same. What key do you like?” he asks you. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n “I don’t think so,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n He snorts at you, but almost immediately loses interest in your presence. “Come back when you need keys,” he says. \n\n \n\n Olaf sits down on his mattress, taking out a number of photos from underneath his pillow and begins flicking through them as if you weren't there.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n He nods, taking off a key from his chain. He opens a nearby metal locker and takes out an old photography camera mounted on a tripod.\n\n \n\n After removing the lens cap and checking the focus, Olaf sits back on his mattress and places the key beside him. “Alright,” he tells you, unwinding a cord with a button release attached to the camera. “Go there.” He points to the wall opposite the camera, where you recognise the background. “You do as I say. I give you my key.”\n\n \n\n It sinks in what you have to do. You slowly walk over to where instructed and face the camera. You look directly into the lenses and you hear the whip of the camera shutter opening and closing.\n\n \n\n “Now. Strip,” Olaf says. You look down to see him begin to rub himself through his overalls.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n Pushing aside any reservations, you look directly into the camera as you take off your blouse, button by button. With a coy shrug, the blouse drops to the floor. You mock pout.\n\n \n\n Out of the corner of your eye, you see Olaf grin. He rubs his groin faster, wrapping his fingers around his covered member as he does so. You realise with reluctance and shock that if you turn him on, he’ll finish faster.\n\n \n\n You put your hands on your exposed hips, posing for the camera as you hear it take a picture. Then you reach behind and unclasp your skirt, letting it fall to the floor.\n\n \n\n Olaf increases his rubbing, gentle movements turning more rigorous. “Keep the socks and shoes. Lose your underwear.”\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n Thinking of any striptease you’ve seen, you turn your back to the camera and begin to unbutton your blouse. You look over your shoulder as you do so, trying to maintain his interest whilst retaining your modesty.\n\n \n\n “Turn around,” Olaf says after you undo the last button. “Or no key for you.”\n\n \n\n With little choice, you turn to face him. You shrug the blouse off your shoulders and pull it away, shivering as you stand in front of the camera in your bra.\n\n \n\n The camera clicks. You shudder as you think of the picture it just took.\n\n \n\n “Now,” Olaf continues to direct you. “Lose the skirt.”\n\n \n\n You wince, but follow his instruction. Reaching behind you, you unclasp your skirt and let it fall to the floor. The cool air in the basement sends goosebumps across your body. \n\n \n\n Olaf increases his rubbing, gentle movements turning more rigorous. “Keep the socks and shoes. Lose your underwear.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You let a coy smile creep on to your face as you reach behind your back and unclip your bra. Dramatically, you hold on to it, holding it out and then flicking it in the direction of Olaf. “Whoops,” you say to him quietly. He leers back at you, tugging at his penis underneath his overalls. \n\n \n\n Another idea comes to you. You reach down to your panties, playing with the hem, then slip your hand down over your genitalia. The touch of your hand across your vulva sends shivers across your body. You can’t help but smile in spite of the situation.\n\n \n\n Is this turning you on too?\n\n \n\n Using your free hand, you work your panties down your thighs and over your socks. With a slight kick of your foot, you fling your panties across the room, standing exposed in front of the camera, fingers massaging your clit.\n\n \n\n – Click. Click click click --\n\n \n\n \n Olaf suddenly squeals a high-pitched grunt that is loud enough to be heard over the machinery. He arches his back and thrusts his groin upwards, crying as you start to see a wet patch forming in his overalls.\n\n \n\n He collapses a moment later back on to his mattress, panting for breath. \n\n \n\n After a few moments where the only sounds are from the generators and plumbing, he sighs, content. With his free hand, he pushes the key next to him towards you.\n\n \n\n “You leave now. With my key.”\n\n \n\n Only waiting one moment longer, you gather up your clothing and rush forward to pick up the key. Olaf makes no attempt to stop you. \n\n \n\n You retreat back out of the alcove and quickly put your clothing back on. Once dressed, you look at your prize in your hand.\n\n \n\n Was that really worth it?\n\n \n\n The thought comes to you as your mind considers all the photos the camera was taking. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Olaf continues to rub himself through his overalls. You can see lines of sweat running down his face. \n\n \n\n “Get on your knees,” he stammers. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n <>\n \n\n You hold back a sigh, but nod to him and face the camera. How did I get into this situation?\n\n \n\n You reach behind your back and unclip your bra, letting it fall away from your body. You look up into the camera and hear a click as your pert breasts hang free and exposed. \n\n \n\n Reaching down, you pull your underwear over your thigh-high socks and clumsily step out of them, almost stumbling as they get caught in your high heels. You look up, legs clamped together, arms folded over your breasts, feeling more vulnerable than you can remember feeling.\n\n \n\n --Click--\n\n \n \n \n Olaf suddenly squeals a high-pitched grunt that is loud enough to be heard over the machinery. He arches his back and thrusts his groin upwards, crying as you start to see a wet patch forming in his overalls.\n\n \n\n He collapses a moment later back on to his mattress, panting for breath. \n\n \n\n After a few moments where the only sounds are from the generators and plumbing, he sighs, content. With his free hand, he pushes the key next to him towards you.\n\n \n\n “You leave now.

Olaf makes no attempt to stop you. \n\n \n\n You retreat back out of the alcove and quickly put your clothing back on. Once dressed, you look at your prize in your hand.\n\n \n\n Was that really worth that key?\n\n \n\n You try to bury the thought as your mind considers all the photos the camera was taking. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Olaf continues to rub himself through his overalls. You can see lines of sweat running down his face. \n\n \n\n “Get on your knees,” he stammers. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n <>\n \n\n You drop down to the grimy floor of the basement, spreading your knees wide and smiling up at the camera, now looking down at you.\n\n \n\n Something about the situation draws you to move a finger down to your clitoris. You begin to play with it, feeling the foreign sensations of pleasure surging up inside your body.\n\n \n\n At the sight of this, you watch Olaf roughly pull at his overalls with an animalistic ferocity. In spite of his indulgence, he never looks away from you. \n\n \n\n You give him a coy look and give in to the draw, sliding a finger inside you. \n\n \n\n --Click. Click Click Click Click--\n\n \n\n The sensation causes you to moan too. There’s a thought for a moment, that here you are, in the school basement, masturbating in front of a greasy janitor in front of a camera. But perversely, it just drives you to feel more pleasure.\n\n \n\n \n Olaf suddenly squeals a high-pitched grunt that is loud enough to be heard over the machinery. He arches his back and thrusts his groin upwards, crying as you start to see a wet patch forming in his overalls.\n\n \n\n He collapses a moment later back on to his mattress, panting for breath. \n\n \n\n After a few moments where the only sounds are from the generators and plumbing, he sighs, content. With his free hand, he pushes the key next to him towards you.\n\n \n\n “You leave now.

Once dressed, you look at your prize in your hand.\n\n \n\n Was that really worth it?\n\n \n\n You try to ignore the thought as your mind considers all the photos the camera was taking. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Olaf suddenly grunts and he leaps to his feet. Without giving you a moment to react, he is standing next to you. Then, you see it. Protruding through a zipper in his overalls, he is vigorously stroking his exposed erect penis, aiming at your face –\n\n \n\n Accompanied by a cry from Olaf, you feel sticky liquid hitting your face. You know exactly what it is. Jets of Olaf’s hot semen coat your forehead and eyes, running down quickly onto your lips. You taste the salty cum seeping into your mouth.\n\n \n\n – Click. Click Click Click Click Click. –\n\n \n\n You realise you’ve shut your eyes only when you blink them open. You feel his seed dripping off your chin, dropping down onto your exposed breasts.\n\n \n\n Olaf stands over you, looking down, his face grinning. “My key yours,” he says, gesturing behind him to the bed. \n\n \n\n You give him a look, then cautiously roll back on to your heels. When he doesn’t make any attempt to stop you, you pick up your clothes and grab the key from his mattress. \n\n \n\n Olaf doesn’t look back as you move around the corner of the alcove. You begin efforts to clean yourself up, wiping as much of the residue on the piping as you can. As you pull on your clothes you are sure that there is still cum on your skin and maybe even in your hair, but without a mirror you can’t tell.\n\n \n\n You look at the key in your hand and cast your mind back to the sounds of the camera shutter taking so many photos.\n\n \n\n Was that really worth doing? Or did you enjoy it?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n\n Though shuddering at hearing his command, you comply and slide down to your knees. You keep them clamped together firmly, looking up directly at the camera looking down on you.\n\n \n\n – Click. Click Click –\n\n \n\n You are not unaware of how this will look on a camera. You’ve seen videos and photos of girls staring up at the camera, naked and submissive, waiting. You just never thought it would be you.\n\n \n\n \n Olaf suddenly squeals a high-pitched grunt that is loud enough to be heard over the machinery. He arches his back and thrusts his groin upwards, crying as you start to see a wet patch forming in his overalls.\n\n \n\n He collapses a moment later back on to his mattress, panting for breath. \n\n \n\n After a few moments where the only sounds are from the generators and plumbing, he sighs, content.

Click Click Click Click Click. –*\n\n \n\n You realise you’ve shut your eyes only when you blink them open. You feel his seed dripping off your chin, dropping down onto your exposed breasts.\n\n \n\n Olaf stands over you, looking down, his face grinning. “My key yours,” he says, gesturing behind him to the bed. \n\n \n\n You give him a look, then cautiously roll back on to your heels.

See all the sluts' secrets.\"\n\n \n\n You smile politely, trying to move past the thought of what Olaf does when no one is watching. \"I really need to get into Terrence Handle's locker,\" you tell him. \"I think he's up to something.\"\n\n \n\n \"Not ma problem,\" Olaf tells you. \"Don't care what boys get up to.\"\n\n \n\n Again, you can only force a smile. \"Do you think you could lend me the key, though?\"\n\n \n\n He looks you up and down, his eyes lingering on your legs. He runs his tongue over his lips. \"You want a locker key? You have to make Olaf happy.\"\n\n \n\n He reaches down and grabs his groin, to emphasise what he's thinking, as if it wasn't clear enough. \"Mouths make Olaf happy,\" he adds.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \"You've got access to all the school keys,\" you tell Olaf. \"Even the locker keys, I bet.\"\n\n \n\n The greasy janitor nods, smiling almost with pride. \"Ma keys get me access to all sorts of places.

You want a locker key? You get Olaf some souvenirs.\"\n\n \n\n You offer him a nod, but inwardly grimace. You haven't seen any photos around that would satisfy him. That he hasn't already seen, that is.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n \n The repugnant janitor nods, and smiles. \"Kneel then, slut,\" he says as he unzips his trousers.\n\n \n\n You do as he says, dropping down to the cold concrete floor, feeling the icy surface through your socks. In front of your face, level with your eyes, is Olaf's thick, stubby shaft. Growing to attention.\n\n \n\n It reeks. The smell of body odour and dry semen invades your nostrils. You notice his bushy pubic hair is matted and clumped together. From the stench you know it's semen.\n\n \n\n \"Sluts lick lollies,\" he tells you.\n\n \n\n You lean forward and run your tongue over his prick, fighting back the instinct to pull away from the smell. It tastes like it smells. Rank. Stale. Unkempt.\n\n \n\n Olaf groans. You feel his clumpy hands wrap through your hair and he presses your mouth against his dick. You briefly sense the scent of urine, wondering if he bothers to use a bathroom or just lets it go when he needs to.\n\n \n\n The stubby stick enters your mouth between your lips. You go prone, letting him force your head back and forth, trying in vain to keep your nose away from the odors that almost overwhelm your senses.\n\n \n\n You don't mind this, do you? Being called a slut as a repulsive man has his way with you?\n\n \n\n Pushing the other voice out of your mind, you focus on moving your tongue around inside your mouth. Trying to provide him pleasure, anything to get this experience to end prematurely.\n\n \n\n He begins to roughly pull your hair back, clasping it in a makeshift ponytail. You feel your eyes streaming as you grow short of breath.\n\n \n\n \"Here's your present,\" he stammers, wrenching your head back and pulling it close to the tip of his penis. You gasp for air, mouth open, taking in smells that aren't this repulsive janitor.\n\n \n\n And then his spunk hits the back of your throat. You choke as your gag reflex kicks in and you suddenly are gasping for air for a different reason.\n\n \n\n As your eyes stream, you hear him chuckle. \"Sluts love that.\"\n\n \n\n Without a moment to stop him, he pulls at your hair and wraps it around his prick, wiping the residual semen away with it. He forces you to look up at him, as he grins back down at you.\n\n \n\n Only then does he let go of your hair. You look down at the floor, taking deep breaths.\n\n \n\n Olaf reaches into his pocket and takes out a set of keys. He unclasps a small one, then hands it to you. \"No more keys for you, though. Not for that.\"\n\n \n\n Standing, you wipe your mouth clean and comb your hair through with your hands. Olaf returns to looking at his photos, seemingly done with you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You look back at Olaf and take a deep breath. “Fall asleep,” you mutter. “And let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n The magic surges out from within you, striking his body like an arrow from a bow. But instead of penetrating his form, it crackles as it touches his clothes and flows down his legs disappearing into the floor.\n\n \n\n Olaf stares back at you, eyes narrowing. “What?” he grunts.\n\n \n\n Focusing your mental eye, you grimace as you feel there is not even an echo of magic upon him. You rack your brain to consider what you did wrong. It felt like you cast it correctly. The void in your inner magical reserves is testament to that. Whatever caused the spell not to take must be something to do with him.\n\n \n\n You give Olaf a polite smile, mentally making a note to check with someone on what could be stopping you casting magic on the janitor.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n You look back at Olaf and take a deep breath. “Fall asleep,” you mutter. “And let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n The magic surges out from within you, striking his body like an arrow from a bow.

Taking a deep breath, you feel the energy curdle around the air in your lungs.\n\n \n\n Olaf stares back at you as you breathe out, his leering expression remaining. “What?” he grunts.\n\n \n\n Focusing your mental eye on him, you see the embers of magic within your breath lingering around his face, but as they touch his skin they flicker and dissipate into nothing. He remains untouched by your spell.\n\n \n\n Looking over him carefully, you rack your brain to consider what you did wrong. It felt like you cast it correctly. The magic in the air is testament to that.

    "text": "You raise your hand before the lesson begins. Prichard hasn’t even opened her register yet, but her eyes snap to you like a hawk spotting movement.\n\n \n\n “Yes?” she says crisply, voice sharp. “Something to share before you begin?”\n\n \n\n You straighten slightly. “I’d like to be excused from the lesson.”\n\n \n\n Her expression doesn't shift. “Excused?” she repeats, as if testing the word on her tongue. “This is an important subject for ladies. The dangers of the world will prey on those ignorant to them. Do you consider that knowing this matter is optional to your safety?”\n\n \n\n You falter under her stare. There’s no warmth. Only the cold certainty of someone who’s never once allowed nonsense in her classroom.\n\n \n\n She continues, voice unchanging. “There is a syllabus, little Miss. There is structure. You will find that women who ignore both often end up lost. I presume you have a reason?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You reach into your satchel and draw out the hall pass. Prichard’s eyes flick to it, narrowing almost imperceptibly. “Well,” she says, her tone dry. “It seems someone believes you have more important business than learning how to survive the world’s dangers.”\n\n \n\n She studies you with the faintest curl of disapproval. “Are you quite certain this is the best use of your time, Miss Phillips? There is much to learn today. Things that might save your life one day.”\n\n \n\n You nod, though the certainty doesn’t quite reach your chest. A small part of you itches to stay and follow the rules. But you hold her gaze.\n\n \n\n Prichard inhales through her nose and gestures briskly toward the door. “Then go. And do try not to speak to strangers on the way. I’ll see you next lesson.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You lean forward slightly in your chair. “Please, Miss Prichard,” you say quietly. “I think I may need to be excused. It’s… women’s matters.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes sharpen. “Speak up, girl.”\n\n \n\n You hesitate, then murmur again, even lower, “It’s… cramps. I didn’t want to be disruptive.”\n\n \n\n Prichard’s nose wrinkles faintly. “Really, Miss Phillips. There are certain topics a lady doesn’t voice aloud. Decorum is part of discipline.”\n\n \n\n You bow your head slightly, saying nothing. She exhales tightly. “Fine. If your body truly insists on misbehaving, I won’t have it interrupting my lesson.”\n\n \n\n She strides to her desk and retrieves a square of notepaper, scribbling a few words with a firm, stabbing motion of her pen. She tears the slip and walks it over to your desk with the precision of a drill sergeant.\n\n \n\n “This excuses you for today only,” she states. “Report to Nurse Rancy. She’s accustomed to handling girls with… weaker constitutions.”\n\n \n\n You nod, murmuring your thanks, but she’s already turned back to the blackboard. “And do try not to faint in the hallway,” she adds. “We’ve enough mess to clean up in here as it is.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You raise your hand quickly before the lesson begins. Prichard's eyes snap to you. “Yes, Miss Phillips?”\n\n \n\n You straighten slightly. “I’d like to be excused from the lesson.”\n\n \n\n Prichard's eyes narrow as they focus on you. \"Is your constitution still proving challenging?\"\n \n \n\n You shift, feeling the eyes of the class on you. \"Just feeling unwell, miss.\"\n\n \n\n The teacher watches you, but snorts. \"Nurse Rancy said you might need to be excused,\" she mutters. \"Fine. Head straight there though, Miss Phillips.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "Nurse Rancy folds her hands behind her back as you shift awkwardly on to the edge of the gurney. She studies you for a moment. “So,” she says calmly. “Why don’t you tell me what seems to be the matter?”\n\n \n\n You offer a vague shrug. “It’s probably nothing. Just, you know. Cramps. Or something like that.”\n\n \n\n “Mmm.” She doesn’t write anything down. Doesn’t even move.\n\n \n\n “I didn’t want to make a fuss,” you add quickly. “I just needed a moment to sit down somewhere. That’s all.”\n\n \n\n She tilts her head slightly. “So, no sharp pain? No nausea? No bleeding?”\n\n \n\n You blink. “No.”\n\n \n\n “Then you came here on your own?”\n\n \n\n “Well, no. I mean, sort of. I was let out of class, and then -”\n\n \n\n “And then you wandered the halls,” she cuts you off. “Rather than coming here. Until you were escorted by a hall monitor.”\n\n \n\n Her voice is calm. Measured. But behind her eyes is something harder.\n\n \n\n “Something must be wrong, Emily,” she says. “The body is smarter than the mind. We just have to listen to it. And right now, your body is saying something’s off. That means a physical inspection is required.”\n\n \n\n She gestures toward you with a subtle flick of her fingers. “All right, missy,” she says, her voice suddenly firmer, “Let’s get those clothes off so we can see what’s what.”\n\n \n Nurse Rancy closes her folder without looking up. “Back again,” she says, almost pleasantly. “Still something not quite right, is there?”\n\n \n\n You try to reply, but she raises a hand gently. “No need. I’ve seen enough to know when a girl’s body is out of step with her mind. And when she’s telling the truth.”\n\n \n\n She steps forward with that same crisp professionalism. “Another physical inspection is required.”\n\n \n\n She gestures calmly toward your clothes. “Spit spot. Get those clothes off so we can see what’s what.”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You stiffen on the edge of the gurney. “I’d really rather not,” you say, trying to keep your voice even. “I don’t think that’s necessary.”\n\n \n\n Nurse Rancy tilts her head slightly, as if you’ve given the wrong answer on a test. “Not necessary,” she repeats. “I see.”\n\n \n\n She turns away for a moment, walks to her desk, and begins leafing through a folder with deliberate calm.\n\n \n\n “You know, Emily,” she says. “Refusal isn’t defiance. It’s a symptom. Of confusion. Discomfort with the body.”\n\n \n\n She turns a page. “These things don’t fix themselves. But they can be corrected. With the right support.”\n\n \n\n She looks up again, eyes steady. “If I report non-compliance, it won’t just stay in your file. There may need to be adjustments. Nutritional support. Reduced marks to redirect focus. You might find yourself placed on a different path. Something more suited to your needs.”\n\n \n\n Rancy smiles gently. “I’d rather avoid that, of course. I want to help you. And I believe that deep down, you want to be helped.”\n\n \n\n She steps closer. “You remember what I said, don’t you? The body is smarter than the mind. Yours is speaking. And I’m the one trained to listen.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You keep your voice steady. “I said no.”\n\n \n\n Nurse Rancy doesn’t flinch. She simply exhales through her nose, almost sadly, and closes your file.\n\n \n\n “Then that’s the choice you’ve made,” she says. “Non-compliance noted.”\n\n \n\n She moves back to her desk and begins writing. “I’ll be docking your grades in physical education and self-discipline,” she says. “We’ll consider it part of a motivational correction.”\n\n \n\n You open your mouth to object again, but she’s already continuing.\n\n \n\n “I’ll also submit a dietary revision,” she adds without looking up. “There are compounds that can help students recalibrate their sense of... cooperation. I don’t personally think you need them, but clearly something’s misaligned.”\n\n \n\n She stands. “You’re dismissed. Come see me again though if you find yourself self-reflecting.”\n\n \n\n There’s no anger in her voice. No drama. You step into the hallway, feeling her eyes on your back the entire time.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n You pause, your protest caught halfway in your throat. Then you exhale and nod.\n\n \n\n Nurse Rancy’s expression doesn’t change, but there’s a quiet satisfaction in her voice. “I’m glad you’ve seen the light.”\n\n \n\n She gestures toward you again, briskly this time. “Now, missy. Let’s get those clothes off.”\n\n \n\n Her tone is all business and clinical. But her eyes never leave you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n \n \n Stripping out of your school uniform, you shiver as the cold air in the office brushes your skin. You disregard your socks, shoes, blouse and skirt, finally standing on the vinyl floor in nothing but your underwear.\n\n \n\n \"All of your clothes, Emily,\" Rancy says as she looks as you. When she doesn't look away, you sigh and strip down to nothing.\n\n \n\n Rancy smiles sweetly. “Take a look in the mirror here,” she tells you.\n\n \n\n You do as she asks, and look into the mirror. Emily. You stare at your own reflection. Nothing about the scene is amiss. Your body has quantifiable imperfections - one breast has a slightly larger nipple, your nose has an odd little dip to it - that only magnify the reality of what you're experiencing. You can see the nurse behind you in the mirror's reflection. Behind you and above you. You feel tiny next to her, and being naked doesn't help.\n\n \n\n You look over your shoulder at her. “What is this about?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Positive body reinforcement,” she says. “Or helping identify where our girls have body issue problems. I bet your women’s issues come from you feeling at odds with your body. Now, do you like what you see?”\n\n \n\n You look back at your reflection, staring at the reflection in the mirror.\n\n \n Once again, you step out of your uniform and approach the mirror. The air in the nurse’s office is cool, still. Rancy stands just behind you - always just behind - her reflection tall and impassive beside your own.\n\n \n\n “Take a good look,” she says quietly. “Your body is speaking. The question is whether you’ve learned to listen.”\n\n \n\n You meet your eyes in the mirror. Emily stares back.\n\n \n\n \n Your gaze drops to your chest. Your breasts are fuller than they were before. The slope more pronounced. When you shift your shoulders, you can see the weight of them respond. A faint flush creeps into your cheeks as you realise how unfamiliar they still feel.\n \n \n Your gaze settles on your chest. Still modest, still uneven. One breast sitting slightly lower, one nipple a touch wider. Nothing unnatural, but enough to remind you of your own scrutiny.\n \n \n \n\n Nurse Rancy doesn't comment. But she watches closely. Measuring your hesitation. Watching for discomfort, or pride.\n\n \n\n “This is the moment that matters,” she says softly. “Not what I see. Not what the boys see. What you see.”\n\n \n\n She lets the words linger, then leans slightly forward and lowers her voice. “Do you feel aligned? Or is there still a dissonance between who you are and what’s in the mirror?”\n\n \n\n She straightens. “Be honest. You owe yourself that much.”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You nod slowly, eyes still on the mirror. “I’m… satisfied,” you say.\n\n \n\n Behind you, Nurse Rancy’s brow lifts, just slightly. “Satisfied,” she echoes, like testing a term she rarely hears.\n\n \n\n There’s a pause. Then a soft, measured exhale.\n\n \n\n “Well,” she says, voice clipped. “That tells me what I need to know. Clearly we’re not getting the right nutrients into you. I’ll be sure to inform Jackie to change your lunch options.”\n\n \n\n She crosses to her clipboard and begins writing. “Good meals support mental clarity. Hormonal balance. Self-awareness. When a girl insists she’s perfectly happy with her body, it’s often a sign something is being missed. A vitamin, a trace element, a core truth.”\n\n \n\n She glances up again. “It’s natural to have doubts, Emily. There’s always something girls wish they could change. You’ll see that, in time.”\n\n \n\n She clicks her pen closed. “Now,” she says, returning to her usual brisk tone. “Get on the scale, missy.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n You hesitate, your eyes still on your reflection. Then, softly, “I wish I were a little different.”\n\n \n\n \n Behind you, Nurse Rancy’s smile fades slightly, replaced with something quieter. More knowing. “Bigger?” \n\n \n\n You look at the nurse in the mirror. You can only nod.\n\n \n\n “Oh, Emily,” she says softly. “I didn’t think you’d turn out to be one of those girls.”\n\n \n\n She steps closer, leaning in until her voice is almost a whisper in your ear. “I’ve done what I can for you. But girls like you... well, there are others in the world who can help. Or at least, beyond this town.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes flick to yours in the mirror. “You know what I mean. You’ve felt it. The places that exist just out of sight. Out of town. If you really want to become one of those girls, there are plenty of people who’ll help you take the next step.”\n\n \n\n The implication curls in your stomach. She isn’t offering you a choice. She’s telling you what you will do. What your body wants to do.\n\n \n\n And even as your mind reels, part of you finds the thought appealing. You want to seek them out. Whoever they are.\n\n \n\n *You want… more?*\n \n \n\n She steps back and taps the clipboard with a click of her pen. “Now,” she says crisply, “get on the scale, missy.”\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n Behind you, Nurse Rancy smiles. It’s warm. Pleased. Understanding. “I’m so glad you said that,” she murmurs. “It means we can begin.”\n\n \n\n Before you can respond, you feel a sudden sharpness at your upper arm. A brief sting. You blink and look down just as she pulls away a small syringe, already half-hidden in her pocket.\n\n \n\n “Shh,” she says, still smiling. “Nothing to worry about. Just something to help your body along. Take a look.”\n\n \n\n You glance back at the mirror. Your breasts look fuller. Plumper. You press your arms against your sides slightly. There’s a difference. Not huge but enough to notice.\n\n \n\n “You see?” Rancy says, almost maternally. “Your body just needed the right encouragement. You’ll welcome it soon enough.”\n\n \n\n You nod. Almost instinctively. Even though something about this - and her - still feels off, the change doesn’t unsettle you the way you thought it might.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You step up onto the scale on your bare feet, the cold metal plate cool against your soles. Nurse Rancy makes a small adjustment to the counterweights, levelling your eyes with the beam.\n\n \n\n “Seven stone,” she notes aloud. “Just about. A little thing, aren’t you?”\n\n \n\n Her tone is light, but you hear the faint disapproval threaded behind it.\n\n \n\n Without asking, she swings up the height bar and adjusts it until it rests against the crown of your head. “Five foot four,” she announces. Then squints at the mark again. “And a quarter. Just.”\n\n \n\n She makes a small ‘hmm’ sound in the back of her throat and steps around you, tapping her pen against her clipboard. “Well,” she muses. “You’re not tall, thank goodness. Tall girls always think they have to lead.” Her smile is polite, even warm. “But still, I’d imagine you’d feel more secure if you were just a touch shorter. Boys like it when you fit beneath their arms. Makes them feel needed.”\n\n \n\n She looks up at you, her voice lowering. “Don’t you sometimes wish you were a little more petite? Just enough to feel safe. And looked after.”\n\n \n You step onto the scale again, the familiar chill of the metal plate pressing against your feet. Nurse Rancy doesn’t say a word. She just adjusts the counterweights, watching the beam settle into balance.\n\n \n\n “Still hovering around seven stone,” she murmurs, scribbling something on her clipboard. “At least you’re consistent.”\n\n \n\n She reaches for the height bar and brings it down carefully.\n\n \n\n \n “Five foot three,” she says crisply. “Perfect. I can’t tell you how pleased I am with your progress. Petite girls walk through the world differently. They learn to move with care. With deference.” She smiles, not unkindly. “It suits you.”\n\n \n “Still five four,” she says with a hint of disappointment. “You’ve got a long way to go if you want to feel truly delicate. But we’ll get there.”\n\n \n \n\n She folds her arms and looks you over. “You’d feel more protected if you were a touch smaller. Just imagine how much easier life might feel, when the world sees you as softer. Smaller.”\n\n \n\n She cocks her head slightly. “Wouldn’t you like that?”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n “I wish I was shorter,” you murmur.\n\n \n\n Nurse Rancy pauses. “Even shorter than you are now?” she asks, voice barely above a whisper. Her expression shifts into something more curious and more conspiratorial.\n\n \n\n You nod.\n\n \n\n She steps closer, her tone lowering further. “Do you see yourself as the smallest girl in the room, Emily?” Her eyes study you carefully. “Looking up at everyone. Letting them tower over you. Feeling their presence above you. And letting them guide you.”\n\n \n\n You swallow, but say nothing. Rancy doesn't need you to. She sees the answer on your face. Her voice softens, almost affectionate. “You're not just chasing height, are you? You want to feel meek. Submissive. Like the world was meant to keep you protected. Or pressed down.”\n\n \n\n She lets that sit between you for a moment, before leaning in just a touch more. “I can’t help with that. Not anymore. But there are clubs outside of town. Quiet places. Discreet. People there who understand what girls like you need. Who can help you become what you’re really trying to be. Physically. Mentally. And they'll indulge your needs.”\n\n \n\n Her smile is gentle, but her eyes are not. “You'll find them,” she murmurs. “If you really want to.”\n\n \n \n Then she steps back and clears her throat. “Now do me a favour and bend over, missy.”\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n You nod slowly. “I guess… I wish I was a little shorter.”\n\n \n\n Nurse Rancy’s expression doesn’t shift, but her hand is already moving towards the tray. She pulls out a slim syringe filled with a liquid. The amber glow of it pulses faintly, almost hypnotically.\n\n \n\n “This’ll help you on your journey,” she says, almost kindly. “You’d be amazed what an inch or two can do for a girl’s perspective.”\n\n \n\n Before you can reply, the needle pricks your thigh. It stings, but with a strange warmth that lingers. Magic. You can feel it.\n\n \n\n Your limbs feel looser. Your clothes subtly looser too. The room tilts ever so slightly, like it’s expanded around you. Like you’ve shrunk into it.\n\n \n\n You blink. Nothing feels wrong.\n\n \n\n “You’ll welcome it,” she says softly. “You’ll feel more manageable. And the world will seem just a bit more secure.”\n\n \n\n And oddly, you do. Even though something in the back of your mind tells you not to.\n\n \n\n Then, her voice sharpens again. “Now do me a favour and bend over, missy.”\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You hold her gaze, looking up at her. “I think I’m fine as I am.”\n\n \n\n Nurse Rancy’s smile tightens. She nods once, but it feels more like punctuation than agreement.\n\n \n\n “Mm. Of course. And sometimes it takes a little time before the body admits what the mind won’t say.”\n\n \n\n She turns to your file and begins writing. “I’ll adjust your lunch intake,” she says. “Not to change anything, mind you. Just to support clearer thinking. The right nutrients, properly administered, can do wonders for self-perception.”\n\n \n\n She closes the folder gently and turns back toward you. “Most girls come around. In time. Especially once they realise how much easier things become when they take up less space.”\n\n \n\n She steps aside, all professionalism again. “Now do me a favour and bend over, missy.”\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n You bend over, grabbing your ankles as instructed. The vinyl beneath your feet squeaks faintly. Your legs tremble slightly as you spread them wider. Your breasts sway forward, drawing tight under gravity, and your cheeks flush from the blood rushing to your head.\n\n \n\n Behind you, you hear the snap of gloves. Then the cold press of metal against your inner thigh.\n\n \n\n Without warning, Nurse Rancy inserts the speculum in-between your legs. She inserts a gynecological clamp into your womb, then ratchets it open. It feels like a giant fist is inside your body.\n\n \n\n “You know,” she says casually, as though commenting on the weather. “This part isn’t strictly necessary.” She adjusts the clamp with clinical detachment. “I’ve already read your file. I know your hormone baselines.”\n\n \n\n Then her voice drops, lower, almost amused. “But this serves as a reminder that girls who lie to get out of classes might need to rely on other assets to get them through life.”\n\n \n\n A gloved hand presses against your lower back, holding you in place. She pauses. Then adds, almost cheerfully, “Besides. I enjoy this.”\n\n \n\n Her hand twists suddenly into your hair, pulling you upright. You gasp as she steers you toward the gurney.\n\n \n\n “You can get dressed now.”\n\n \n You bend over again, fingers brushing your ankles. The motion is familiar now. Mechanical. Your skin prickles in the sterile air, your bare back exposed under the office lights.\n\n \n\n Behind you, Nurse Rancy moves efficiently. The cold speculum is already poised. There’s no hesitation as she inserts it and begins to ratchet it open.\n\n \n\n The tension spreads through your body, just as it did before. Your womb feels full. Stretched. But this time, the feeling isn't shocking. Feeling this full sends shivers across your body. You feel your breath quicken.\n\n \n\n “Curious, isn’t it?\" Rancy says from behind you. \"I wonder what brought you back here. Are you really feeling unwell?” She leans closer, voice softer now. “Or did something inside you want this?”\n\n \n\n The metal clicks gently as she adjusts. You gasp as the clamp inside you opens further. “Perhaps it’s not me,” she muses. “Perhaps it’s the feeling. The exposure. The helplessness. You’re not the first girl to discover she needs this kind of attention.”\n\n \n\n You swallow, but say nothing.\n\n \n\n “I know a few men,” she continues, a whisper now. “Who would pay handsomely for someone like you. Needy. Compliant. Not quite aware of how far she's already gone.”\n\n \n\n Your thoughts swirl. You’re not that kind of girl. You didn’t come here for this. And yet part of you wonders. Wonders what it is she sees. Wonders if you’re starting to see it too.\n\n \nAren't you forgetting something? You aren't any kind of girl!\n\n \n\n Her voice threads between your thoughts. “There’s something inside you, Emily. Something small. Something that just wants to be told what to do.”\n\n \n\n She twists the speculum one final notch. Your breath catches. You can’t quite tell if it’s pain. Or pressure. Or something else.\n\n \n\n Then, abruptly, she pulls it free. “Up,” she says simply. And you stand.\n\n \n\n “You can get dressed now.”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You reach for your uniform in silence. The air in the nurse’s office feels thicker now, like it’s pressing against your skin. You move slowly, limbs still buzzing from the cold examination table and everything that came with it.\n\n \n\n Your blouse catches awkwardly as you tug it over your head. You smooth it down with trembling fingers. Your skirt feels tighter than you remember. Or maybe you just feel more exposed.\n\n \n\n Across the room, Nurse Rancy is already back at her desk, scribbling something into your file with clean, deliberate strokes. She doesn’t look up.\n\n \n\n When you’re fully dressed, she finally stands and tears a slip from a notepad. “Fit for studies,” she says flatly, handing it over.\n\n \n\n Then, with the same calm finality, she gestures toward the full-length mirror near the cabinet.\n\n \n\n “Take a look,” she says. “Make sure everything’s in place.”\n\n \n\n You step forward slowly, glancing into the reflection. Yourself, in uniform. Just as you were when you entered. Or mostly. Your gaze catches on your silhouette. Lingers on your face. Something feels off. Or maybe it’s just your imagination.\n\n \n\n \n Nurse Rancy steps closer, her eyes meeting yours in the mirror. “This is you, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n\n \n Nurse Rancy’s voice cuts in behind you. “Are you really happy with this?”\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n You look in the mirror and nod slowly. “Yes,” you say. “This is me.”\n\n \n\n Nurse Rancy’s expression doesn’t shift, but something in her posture relaxes. “Of course it is,” she murmurs. “That’s who you’ve always been. It just took your body a little time to catch up.”\n\n \n\n She steps closer, voice low and steady. “And this body. It suits you better. Doesn’t it?”\n\n \n\n You pause. Your mouth opens on its own. “Yes.”\n\n \n\n The word feels easy. Like it’s always been true.\n\n \n\n Rancy smiles. “Good girl.”\n\n \n\n \n She places the file back in her drawer. “I’m glad you’ve finally accepted who you are. A lying little thing like you, trying to skip class. Well, you’ll just have to rely on other charms.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes flick down your body with clinical appraisal. “And now,” she says. “You have them.”\n\n \n\n She folds her hands behind her back. “I don’t think I can do much more for you here. But if you ever feel like you need further support, there are places. People. Resources just outside Charlton who specialise in helping girls like you.”\n\n \nRancy picks up a pen and scribbles something down on a notepad. \"I'll make a note to adjust your lunch intake, too. Girls with a positive body image of themselves don't need extra supplements and nutrients, after all.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n She tilts her head. \"Still, your chest could do with a little help,\" she says, tone almost playful. “You feel a little inadequate, don’t you?”\n\n \n\n Your heart stirs. “Maybe.”\n\n \n\n She nods. “That’s natural. You’ve already started your journey. And it’s perfectly normal to want more.”\n\n \n\n She taps your file lightly. “Come back again. I can help you feel complete.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n “You’re still so tall,” she says, her voice calm. “Don’t you think that clashes with your personality?”\n\n \n\n You feel the suggestion settle in. Unease prickles at your neck. “I… guess it might.”\n\n \n\n Rancy nods, warm and reassuring. “That’s okay. You’re still learning about yourself. And that’s a good thing.”\n\n \n\n She rests a hand on your shoulder. “Come back again, if you’d like. I can help you feel more proportionate.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n You shake your head. “No,” you say softly. “This… isn’t me.”\n\n \n\n For a moment, the room is still. Nurse Rancy’s lips press into a thin line. “I see,” she says at last, her voice even. “After all that effort. After all the support I’ve provided. And still denial.”\n\n \n\n She turns back to your file, flipping it open with clinical precision. “It’s always the same with girls like you. You want change. You seek help. But the moment progress is made... the moment your body begins to reflect who you are. You run from it.”\n\n \n\n She looks up again. “You need help, Emily. Real help. But until you’re willing to accept what you asked for, you’ll never be at peace.”\n\n \n\n She closes the file with a soft thud. “A small dietary adjustment should help clear your mind. Just enough conviction to get through the fog of your own resistance.”\n\n \n\n Rancy gives you a final, tight-lipped smile. “You may go. Come see me when you're serious about your health.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n You meet her eyes in the mirror. “Yes,” you say quietly. “I’m happy with what I see.”\n\n \n\n For a moment, Nurse Rancy doesn’t respond. Then she exhales. “There’s no shame in wanting to be the best version of yourself, Emily,” she says softly. “It’s not weakness. It’s clarity.”\n\n \n\n She steps back to her desk and makes a note in your file. “I’ll be adjusting your lunchtime intake,” she adds, her tone crisp again. “Something to help clear the fog. Once your mind is a little quieter, you might find it easier to hear what your body’s really trying to tell you. Maybe then you’ll find your way back here and we can begin helping you.”\n\n \n\n She hands you your slip again - now stamped with **Fit for studies** - and gives a final nod toward the door.\n\n \n\n “You’re dismissed.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n You stare at your reflection. The same reflection you’ve seen a hundred times. But today it feels different. Not better. Just off.\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “No,” you admit softly. “I don’t think I am.”\n\n \n\n Behind you, Nurse Rancy smiles with quiet satisfaction. “There’s no shame in that, Emily,” she says. “It’s perfectly healthy to want self-improvement. To acknowledge that how we feel on the inside doesn’t always match what we see in the mirror.”\n\n \n\n She closes your file with a gentle snap. “We’re out of time today,” she says, “but I want you to know that I’m here. When you’re ready to begin your treatment, all you have to do is ask.”\n\n \n\n She places the slip into your hand - **Fit for studies** - then gently guides you toward the door.\n\n \n\n “You’ve made progress,” she says warmly. “Just recognising the dissonance… that’s the first step.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "Reagan’s fingers tighten on the edges of the book, her knuckles paling as her grip tenses. “It’s nothing. Just some light reading,” she says, her tone clipped and dismissive. “Not that it’s any of your business.”\n\n \n\n Her gaze sharpens, daring you to press further. “Though I suppose someone like you would be curious,” she adds with a mocking smile. “Always poking around in things you don’t understand. But let me save you the effort. It’s not for you. So why don’t you go find something more... suitable for your skill level? Maybe a picture book.”\n\n \n\n She flips a page with exaggerated precision, her attention ostensibly back on the text but her body language remaining rigid. “Oh, and before you ask. No, I’m not going to let you borrow it, take a look, or even ask me another question about it. I have work to do, and you’ve already wasted more of my time than you deserve.”\n\n \n\n Reagan leans back slightly, her eyes narrowing as she watches your reaction. “Is there anything else, or are we done here? I’m sure you have something marginally more productive to do.”\n\n \n Reagan’s fingers tighten on the edges of the book, her knuckles paling as her grip tenses. “It’s nothing. Just some light reading,” she says, her tone clipped. But cautious. As if she's scared.\n\n \n\n She leans back slightly, her eyes trying to gauge your reaction. But she says nothing more.\n \n \n Reagan’s fingers tighten on the edges of the book, her knuckles paling as her grip tenses. “It’s nothing. Just some light reading,” she says, her tone clipped and dismissive. “Not that it’s any of your business.”\n\n \n\n She leans back slightly, her eyes narrowing as she watches your reaction. “Is there anything else, or are we done here? I’m sure you have something marginally more productive to do.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n \n You glance at the book in Reagan’s hands. \"That looks fascinating,\" you say. \"Mind if I take a look? Maybe even borrow it?\"\n\n \n\n Reagan pauses, her fingers tracing the spine of the book as if reluctant to let go. But then, as if a switch flips, her expression softens, and her lips curve into a faint smile. \"Well, I don’t usually let people touch my things,\" she says, tilting her head. \"But I suppose you’re an exception.\"\n\n \n\n She holds the book out to you, her tone casual but tinged with something uncharacteristically warm. \"Take care of it. It’s not the kind of thing you want to misplace. Or mess up.\"\n\n \n\n As you take the book, she gives you a small nod, her sharp eyes watching you carefully. \"Just don’t come to me if something bad happens with it. On your head, it will be.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You glance at the book in Reagan’s hands. \"That looks interesting,\" you say, trying to keep your tone light. \"Think I could borrow it for a bit?\"\n\n \n\n Reagan looks at you, then bursts into laughter - a sharp, biting sound that echoes through the library. \"You? Borrow this?\" she repeats, her eyes narrowing as her laughter subsides. \"I didn’t realize you had such a sense of humor.\"\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, crossing her arms, the book held protectively against her chest. \"No. Absolutely not. This isn’t a library loaner, and you’re definitely not qualified to handle it.\"\n\n \n\n Her gaze sharpens, her smile turning into a smirk. \"Besides, even if I did let you, which I won’t, you’d just waste your time staring at pages you can’t even begin to comprehend.\" She leans forward slightly, her voice dropping to a taunting whisper. \"So why don’t you run along and find something more your speed? I think there’s a nice cookbook section somewhere in the back.\"\n\n \n\n Reagan straightens up, returning her attention to the book with a final dismissive glance. \"You’ve got your answer. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m busy.\"\n\n \n You nod toward the book. \"That looks important. Mind if I borrow it?\"\n\n \n\n As Reagan looks back at you, you notice her take in a slight intake of breath. \"I didn't think...\"\n\n \n\n She trails off, staring back at you. For a moment, she looks as though she’s trying to decide if you’re serious. Another deep breath.\n\n \n\n \"No,\" she says flatly. \"I don't think so.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes watch you, alert. The kind of look that you've seen from animals on nature documentaries when they sense impending danger.\n\n \n You nod toward the book. \"That looks important. Mind if I borrow it?\"\n\n \n\n Reagan glances at you, her expression hardening immediately. \"Excuse me?\" she says, her tone flat and icy. For a moment, she looks as though she’s trying to decide if you’re serious. Then a sharp, humorless laugh escapes her.\n\n \n\n \"Borrow this?\" she repeats, shaking her head as if the very idea is absurd. \"Who even are you? No. Absolutely not.\"\n\n \n\n Reagan leans forward slightly, the book held firmly in her hands. \"Here’s an idea: why don’t you try borrowing something else? Preferably something you can actually understand.\" She smirks, her tone dripping with mockery.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \"You’re going to give me that book,\" you say, keeping your voice low and steady. \"Unless you want the whole school to know about your little lunchtime getaways with Mr. Harrow.\"\n\n \n\n \n That gets her attention. Reagan’s gaze snaps up, staring back at you with a calculated expression. Unusually for Reagan though, she holds back her words.\n\n \n\n \"I’m sure the teachers would love to hear about it,” you press on. “And imagine what your little cheer squad would think. Miss Perfect, sneaking off to a hotel with a teacher. Not so perfect after all.\"\n\n \n\n A thin smile creeps on to Reagan’s face. “You would know a lot about that, now wouldn’t you?”\n\n \n\n She leans forward now, her voice dropping to a silky, dangerous tone. \"Here’s a thought: blackmail only works if the other person cares. And I don’t.\" Her lips curl into a sharp smile. \"But you? I wonder if I could take you. Make you forget what you were even doing here.”\n\n \n\n Before you can react, Reagan takes in a deep breath, then exhales. The space around you seems to shift, growing thick and heavy, like the room itself is pressing down on you. A strange warmth spreads through your body, starting in your chest and radiating outward.\n\n \n\n Her eyes gleam with satisfaction as she watches you. \"Let’s see if you’ve still got it,\" she says, her voice dripping with menace.\n\n \n That gets her attention. Reagan’s gaze snaps up, her expression a mask of cool indifference, though you catch a flicker of something sharper in her eyes. \"Bold of you,\" she says, leaning back in her chair. \"Stupid, but bold.\"\n\n \n\n You press on, refusing to let her regain the upper hand. \"I’m sure the teachers would love to hear about it. And imagine what your little cheer squad would think. Miss Perfect, sneaking off to a hotel with a teacher. Not so perfect after all.\"\n\n \n\n Reagan exhales a sharp laugh, shaking her head. \"Do you really think this is going to work?\" She straightens up, her fingers drumming lightly on the cover of the book. \"Blackmail’s a risky game. You might want to consider what happens when the other player decides not to play.\"\n\n \n\n She leans forward now, her voice dropping to a silky, dangerous tone. \"Here’s a thought: blackmail only works if the other person cares. And I don’t.\" Her lips curl into a sharp smile. \"But you? You might care when you forget what you were even doing here.\"\n\n \n\n Before you can react, Reagan takes in a deep breath, then exhales. The space around you seems to shift, growing thick and heavy, like the room itself is pressing down on you. A strange warmth spreads through your body, starting in your chest and radiating outward.\n\n \n\n Her eyes gleam with satisfaction as she watches you. \"Let’s see how confident you feel when you can’t even remember why you walked into this library,\" she says, her voice dripping with menace.\n\n \n \n\n \n \n The warmth in your chest blooms, softening your thoughts like mist rolling over a field. Reagan’s voice feels more reasonable now, her confidence unshakable. Maybe blackmailing her wasn’t such a great idea. Maybe she’s right.\n\n \n\n \"Shame,\" she says, her voice disappointed. “So much potential. So wasted. Look how far you’ve fallen.”\n\n \n\n Before you can answer - or even remember what you wanted to say - she whispers quietly. \"Fall asleep, and let your memories drift as you slumber.\"\n\n \n\n Drowsiness crashes over you like a wave. Your knees buckle, your vision blurs, and her calm, piercing gaze is the last thing you see before the darkness takes you.\n\n \n\n You awaken moments later, sitting in the library, a dull haze clouding your mind. Reagan watches you, arms crossed, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. \"Oh dear. Looks like your life is too much for you,\" she says, grinning. \"Had a taxing day stacking shelves in the department store?\"\n\n \n\n You nod, the question of why you’re here slipping from your grasp. \"Yeah... I guess.”\n\n \n\n She gestures toward the exit. \"You should get going. Take a breather.\"\n\n \n\n Without hesitation, you stand. Whatever brought you here... it doesn’t seem to matter anymore.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"That’s better,\" she says, her voice like silk, a triumphant smile on her lips. \"You really don’t understand what you’re playing with, do you?\"\n\n \n\n Before you can answer - or even remember what you wanted to say - she whispers quietly. \"Fall asleep, and let your memories drift as you slumber.\"\n\n \n\n Drowsiness crashes over you like a wave. Your knees buckle, your vision blurs, and her calm, piercing gaze is the last thing you see before the darkness takes you.\n\n \n\n You awaken moments later, sitting in the library, a dull haze clouding your mind. Reagan watches you, arms crossed, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. \"You’ve been out of it,\" she says lightly. \"Long day?\"\n\n \n\n You nod, the question of why you’re here slipping from your grasp. \"Yeah... I guess.\"\n\n \n\n She gestures toward the exit. \"You should get going. Take a breather.\"\n\n \n\n Without hesitation, you stand. Whatever brought you here... it doesn’t seem to matter anymore.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n The warmth of the spell presses against your thoughts. But instead of softening, it recoils, like a wave crashing against a solid wall. You feel Reagan’s magic unravel, her power flickering out like a dying flame.\n\n \n\n Reagan’s eyes widen, genuine shock breaking through her usual composure. \"You. How did you...?\" she stammers, her fingers curling as if preparing another spell, but she quickly stops herself. Her gaze sweeps over you, evaluating, calculating.\n\n \n\n Finally, she lets out a sharp breath, forcing a tight smile onto her lips. \"Well, well,\" she says, her tone clipped but betraying a hint of nervousness. \"Looks like Christina’s little protégé has more tricks up her sleeve than I gave her credit for.\"\n\n \n\n Her grip on the Translations of the Sevrene Shards tightens briefly before she thrusts the book toward you with a forced air of nonchalance. \"Take it.\"\n\n \n\n Reagan steps back, her sharp eyes watching you closely. \"But don’t think this means anything. You got lucky, that’s all.\" Without waiting for a response, she turns on her heel and strides away, her confidence visibly shaken.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n The warmth of the spell pushes against your mind, but instead of bending to her will, you feel the magic ripple and break, scattering harmlessly like wind over stone. Reagan’s expression freezes, her confident smirk replaced by a flicker of confusion. Then fear.\n\n \n\n \"You...\" Her voice wavers as she steps back, her eyes scanning you. \"Still? How…\"\n\n \n\n Her gaze darts between you and the book, her fingers tightening around its cover as though it might shield her. But as you stand firm, unaffected, a look of panic flashes across her face. \"You said you weren't going to…\" she whispers, before trailing off.\n\n \n\n Her hands shake as she shoves the Translations of the Sevrene Shards into your arms, her usual poise crumbling. \"Take it,\" she says sharply. \"Just... take it.”\n\n \n\n Without waiting for a response, Reagan turns and hurries out of the library, glancing over her shoulder one last time before disappearing through the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n The warmth of the spell pushes against your mind, but instead of bending to her will, you feel the magic ripple and break, scattering harmlessly like wind over stone. Reagan’s expression freezes, her confident smirk replaced by a flicker of confusion. Then fear.\n\n \n\n \"You...\" Her voice wavers as she steps back, her eyes scanning you like you’re some kind of puzzle she can’t solve. \"Who are you?\"\n\n \n\n Her gaze darts between you and the book, her fingers tightening around its cover as though it might shield her. But as you stand firm, unaffected, a look of panic flashes across her face. \"What are you?\" she whispers, the words barely audible.\n\n \n\n Her hands shake as she shoves the Translations of the Sevrene Shards into your arms, her usual poise crumbling. \"Take it,\" she says sharply, her voice laced with fear. \"Just... take it. And stay away from me.\"\n\n \n\n Without waiting for a response, Reagan turns and hurries out of the library, glancing over her shoulder one last time before disappearing through the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You take a steady breath, letting the magic gather in your chest before exhaling it in a controlled stream toward Reagan. The spell ripples through the air, settling over her like a delicate haze. For a moment, nothing happens. Then you notice the faintest flicker of change in her expression, her sharp eyes softening ever so slightly.\n\n \n\n Reagan’s fingers relax around the book, her usual sharpness dulled into something calmer, almost agreeable. She tilts her head, studying you with an uncharacteristically thoughtful look.\n\n \n\n \"You know,\" she says, her voice smoother now, her usual edge softened, \"I suppose I could let you have it. Just for a little while.\" Her hand hovers over the book, as though the decision is still being processed. Then, with a small sigh, she extends it toward you.\n\n \n\n \"But don’t get any ideas,\" she adds, her tone attempting to regain some of its usual authority. \"I expect it back in perfect condition. And if you mess this up...\" She trails off, shaking her head slightly, as though the words fail her.\n\n \n\n You take the book carefully, her eyes still watching you with a strange mix of reluctance and compliance. As you step back, her gaze lingers, a faint crease forming in her brow. \"Go on, then,\" she mutters, turning away abruptly. \"Before I change my mind.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n You take a deep breath, focusing the magic in your chest before exhaling it toward Reagan. The spell ripples through the air like an unseen wave, subtle and deliberate, as it moves toward her. For a moment, you think it’s working. Her eyes flicker, and she pauses mid-motion.\n\n \n\n Then, almost imperceptibly, her expression hardens. Her lips curl into a sharp, dangerous smile as she tilts her head, her gaze locking onto yours with a piercing intensity.\n\n \n\n \"Really?\" she says, her voice dripping with mockery. \"You thought that would work on me?\" She straightens, the faint shimmer of your spell dissolving around her like water against stone.\n \n \n\n \n Reagan clicks her tongue, shaking her head with exaggerated disappointment. \"Naughty, Emily. You should know better than to use magic against me. It’s... unbecoming of one of our own.\" Her eyes gleam with a mix of amusement and condescension as she steps closer.\n\n \n\n \"But never mind,\" she purrs, her tone softening in a way that feels far more threatening. \"I’ll make sure this little indiscretion doesn’t trouble you again. In fact... let’s ensure you have no interest in the book at all.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice lowers to a near-whisper, each word carrying a gentle, hypnotic rhythm. \"Fall asleep, Emily, and let your fascination with this book fade as you dream.\"\n\n \n\n The world dims in an instant, and when you open your eyes, you’re sitting in the library, your head heavy and your thoughts muddled. Reagan stands nearby, arms crossed. \"You dozed off,\" she says with a faint smile. \"Why don’t you head out? Looks like you’ve had enough excitement for one day.\"\n\n \n\n You nod absently, unaware of why you feel so tired. Or what you were here for in the first place.\n\n \n Reagan clicks her tongue, shaking her head with disappointment. \"I thought you would be better at that. Even now.” She purses her lips. “To think, I admired you.”\n\n \n\n She steps closer, her sharp gaze never leaving you. \"But never mind,\" she purrs, her tone softening in a way that feels far more threatening. \"I’ll make sure this little dabble for power doesn’t surface again. In fact... let’s ensure you have no interest in the book at all.\"\n\n \n\n Her voice lowers to a near-whisper, each word carrying a gentle, hypnotic rhythm. \"Fall asleep, Jen, and let your fascination with this book fade as you dream.\"\n\n \n\n The world dims in an instant, and when you open your eyes, you’re sitting in the library, your head heavy and your thoughts muddled. Reagan stands nearby, arms crossed. \"You dozed off,\" she says with condescension. \"Must have been a busy week, looking after old ladies wanting new dresses. Why don’t you head out? Looks like you’ve had enough excitement for one day.\"\n\n \n\n You nod absently, unaware of why you feel so tired. Or what you were here for in the first place.\n\n \n Reagan tilts her head, her expression shifting from mockery to curiosity as she studies you. \"Well, well,\" she murmurs, her voice quieter now. \"I didn’t realize you knew magic. That’s... intriguing.\"\n\n \n\n She steps closer, her sharp gaze never leaving you. \"Should I tell someone, I wonder?\" Her lips curve into a sly smile. \"Or maybe I’ll keep this little discovery to myself. For now. It’s always nice to have something useful tucked away for the future.\"\n\n \n\n \"But first, let’s take care of this messy little problem. Fall asleep, and let your fascination with this book fade into nothing.\"\n\n \n\n A wave of exhaustion crashes over you, pulling you under. When you awaken, you’re still in the library, disoriented and groggy. Reagan is leaning against a nearby table, watching you with a faint smirk. \"Looks like you needed a nap,\" she says lightly. \"Go on, get some fresh air.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, a vague sense of unease lingering, though you can’t quite remember why.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n “I’ve seen you talking to Terrence,” you say. “You, Stacey, Britney. What’s going on?”\n\n \n\n Reagan doesn’t look away. “Didn’t realise you were on the squad leadership committee.”\n\n \n\n You fold your arms. “It’s just a question.”\n\n \n\n Now she studies you. Sharp-eyed, like she’s measuring something. “You might have the uniform,” she says. “But don’t confuse costume for rank. If Chrissie wants you to know, she’ll tell you. Until then, stop sniffing around other people’s business.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes hold on you, almost daring you to continue the conversation. When she realises you won't, she smiles.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You narrow your eyes in the dim halo of the lamp. “Who are you?”\n\n \n\n For a long moment, she says nothing. Then she leans forward, voice low and teasing. “I’m the shadow at the edge of your questions. The whisper you almost catch but never quite hear.” Her smile gleams in the street light. \"Or just a mouth that never quits. What’s in a name, anyway?”\n\n \n\n When you press, your voice is firmer. “Tell me.”\n\n \n\n She sighs. “You can call me Siobhan. By trade, I work at the carnival. Joined them a few years back when they toured up north. But to you, that doesn’t matter. I’m help, if you want it.”\n\n \n\n You lift an eyebrow. “And why are you helping me?”\n\n \n\n Her smile widens, unsettling and knowing. She folds her arms beneath the tattered shawl at her shoulders. \"Magic isn’t meant to be kept chained up for them toffs and well-connected lot. There’s a whole world out there that can help folk like you. I’m here to free it. If you’ll let me.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Siobhan’s grin quirks sharper when you ask, “What do you mean by help?”\n\n \n\n She lets the silence press in, then leans close, voice low. “Help’s a wee window into what they’ll nae speak of. Visions you can’t get by pryin’ at their tongues. I’ve got trinkets that’ll pry open the nights they’d rather forget and show you what lingered afterwards.”\n\n \n\n \n “Talked to both of ’em, have ya? Neither gave you what you came for. Ye want to know what happened? Understand Jennifer? Or help Annie remember? Annie can’t recall, and Jennifer won’t confess. But ye needn’t beg ’em. Ye can see it yerself… and set their memories free. Choose: the careful one or the broken one.”\n\n \n\n With a graceful flick, she produces a small tin from her clothes and snaps it open. Inside lie two delicate leaf cuttings, each pulsing with a faint, otherworldly light. One is brittle and torn, its edges jagged as though fractured; the other is a perfect maple leaf, its veins glowing like living runes.\n\n \n\n “Only one,” she whispers. “Ye have to decide.”\n\n \n “Talked to the blonde one, have ya? Ye want to know what happened? Help Annie remember? Ye needn’t beg her. Ye can see it yerself… and set her memories free.”\n\n \n\n With a graceful flick, she produces a small tin from her clothes and snaps it open. Inside lies a single leaf cutting, pulsing with faint, otherworldly light. It’s brittle and torn, edges jagged as though fractured.\n\n \n\n “Or,” she adds, voice soft as moth wings. \"You can try talking to the brunette. See if she’ll shed any light herself. And if she won’t… I can help you there too. But you’ll have to choose: the broken one or the careful one. And only one. Ye have to decide.”\n\n \n “Talked to the brunette, have ya? Ye want to know what happened? Help Jennifer confess? Ye needn’t beg her. Ye can see it yerself… and set her memories free.”\n\n \n\n With a graceful flick, she produces a small tin from her clothes and snaps it open. Inside lies a single leaf cutting, pulsing with faint, otherworldly light. It’s a perfect maple leaf, its veins glowing like living runes.\n\n \n\n “Or,” she murmurs, “you can seek out the blonde. See if her memories might surface. And if she stays silent… I can help you there too. But you’ll have to choose: the careful one or the broken one. And only one. Ye have to decide.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n You draw in a steadying breath. “What do you know about Annie and Jennifer?”\n\n \n\n Siobhan’s lips twitch into a half-smile. She leans back, eyes hooded. “Names are easy. What’s behind ’em is the hard part. And both those girls are steeped in denial, aye?” She lets the words hang, then adds softly, “Denial’s a cosy bed, but it never heals.”\n\n \n\n You sigh, but press her further. “Come on. Tell me about Jennifer.”\n\n \n\n She titters, watching you. \"That lass ’as built walls around ’er memories. Stone and mortar she reckoned kept the past at bay. She buries what she did so deep, even she can’t unearth it.”\n\n \n\n “And Annie?” you try.\n\n \n\n Siobhan’s lips curve with a trace of sorrow. “Annie laughed like sunshine ’til the school gates shut ’er in. She’s trapped behind those gates. Detention’s a cruel cage, that. And she can’t find her way out.”\n\n \n\n Your heart pounds. “So you know what happened to her at school?”\n\n \n\n She steps closer, the lamplight dancing on her clothes. “Let’s just say the night spoke in tongues she couldn’t refuse.” She pauses, voice dropping to a whisper. “That’s why I’m here. To give you the key to their secrets. But only if you’ll take it.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You raise an eyebrow at the tin and ask, “This is magic, isn't it?”\n\n \n\n Siobhan lets the tin rest in her palm, eyes dark with knowing. “Better,” she says softly. “Memory.\"\n\n \n\n \"Not theirs, no,\" she continues. \"Not anymore. But memories leave traces. And magic knows how to look for them.”\n\n \n\n You swallow and whisper, “Is it safe?”\n\n \n\n Her lips curve into that unsettling smile. “Depends what ye mean by safe. Your mind’ll survive… Your self? Mostly.”\n\n \n\n She snaps the lid shut. “When ye sleep, slip it beneath your pillow. Ye’ll dream, but the dream’ll be more than a dream.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Okay,” you say. “I accept your help.”\n\n \n\n \n Siobhan tilts the tin toward you, her gaunt fingers splayed. Inside, two cuttings glow faintly: one brittle and splintered, the other whole and unfurled. She locks eyes with you. “One’s Annie’s memories, brittle and splintered. The other’s Jennifer’s, careful and guarded. You only get one.\"\n\n \n Siobhan tilts the tin toward you, her gaunt fingers splayed. A single leaf cutting glows faintly, brittle and splintered. She meets your gaze. “This here’s Annie’s memories, broken and hidden. Once you take it, there’s no turnin’ back.”\n\n \n Siobhan tilts the tin toward you, her gaunt fingers splayed. A single perfect leaf cutting glows faintly, whole and unfurled. She holds your eyes. \"This one's Jennifer's memories, careful and guarded. Once you choose it, there’s no turnin’ back.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You reach into the tin and lift the brittle, splintered leaf between your fingers. Its jagged edges press into your skin, and a low hum of magic vibrates through the cutting, sending warmth up your arm.\n\n \n\n Siobhan’s voice drifts on the air: “Be in her form when you sleep. Let the dream carry you into her lost memories.” Before you can speak, her shape walks back into the shadows. You step forward to where she was, but she’s gone. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You carefully pluck the perfect, rune-veined maple leaf from the tin. A surge of energy pulses through the cutting, as though the magic inside is waking at your touch. \n\n \n\n Siobhan’s whisper flutters on the night breeze: “Slip this beneath your pillow in her form. The dream will show you what she will not speak.” \n\n \n\n You blink, but when you look up, her shape walks back into the shadows. You step forward to where she was, but she’s gone. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You shake your head. “I’d rather sort this on my own.”\n\n \n\n Siobhan’s eyes flash, almost containing disappointment or even frustration. But she checks it at once, lips tightening into that familiar, knowing smile.\n\n \n\n \n \n She lets out a soft huff. “Ye really think ye can do this without any help?” Her mask slips back into place. “Fine, then. You know where to find me.” She nods once. “If ever you change your mind, ring the bell outside your door. I’ll come when you’ve come to your senses.”\n\n \n\n Her bright eyes hold yours for a heartbeat longer before she steps back into the gloom, leaving you with only the echo of her promise.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n She arches an eyebrow, sighing. “Ye still reckon ye can go it alone?”\n\n \n\n After a pause, her fingers slip inside her tattered shawl. From the shadows she draws a small, silver bell. Its handle is shaped like a curled leaf. She holds it out. “When you decide you need me, ring this at your gate under cover of night. I’ll come running. Offer’s still open… for now.”\n\n \n\n Her bright eyes hold yours for a heartbeat longer before she steps back into the gloom, leaving you with only the echo of her promise.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You compose yourself carefully, meeting Stitch's calculating gaze with practiced confidence. Leaning forward subtly, you soften your voice and offer him a gentle, coaxing smile.\n\n \n\n “Mr. Stitch, surely there's some flexibility here? Someone of your experience and authority must understand that Emily just needs a bit more... encouragement to truly excel.” You smile warmly, attempting to project quiet confidence. “Perhaps with your guidance, she can turn things around?”\n\n \n\n Stitch’s expression darkens, a flash of genuine irritation flickering across his sharp features. He sighs deeply, clearly unimpressed.\n\n \n\n “I expected better from you, Miss Phillips,\" he says coldly, straightening in his seat. “Such tactics may work with other men in Charlton, but I see right through them. This school demands dignity and respect - traits you evidently struggle with.”\n\n \n\n He leans back stiffly, cracking his fingers. “That said, I'll give Emily one final chance. But let me be clear: if this is the example you set, perhaps her academic failures aren't surprising. So consider carefully the consequences of your own actions from this point forward. Charlton does not tolerate such unbecoming behavior.”\n\n \n\n You nod stiffly, embarrassment burning your cheeks, as you rise and exit his office, feeling the weight of his judgment - and the knowledge that you've narrowly avoided disaster. Stitch’s final warning echoes ominously: Emily’s future now rests precariously on the edge.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You try to gather your confidence, attempting a smile that comes out more awkward than charming. Clearing your throat, your words falter slightly as you fumble for the right approach. “Mr. Stitch...maybe if...I mean, perhaps Emily might do better if you...uh, if she had a second chance? There must be, uh, something I could do to convince you.”\n\n \n\n Your attempt is painfully transparent, lacking any of the subtlety or poise you intended. Stitch stares at you impassively for a moment, his lips twisting into a thin, humorless smile.\n\n \n\n “You know,” Stitch says coldly, barely disguising his amusement, \"I should find that insulting, but your effort was so pitiful I almost feel sympathy instead.\"\n\n \n\n His lips curl into a sharp, sardonic smirk. \"If that’s your best attempt at persuasion, Emily truly has no hope. In Charlton, there are limited roles for girls who don’t finish school. Perhaps Emily should start preparing herself for that future. Though if your charm is any indication, she’ll find her tip jar disappointingly empty.\"\n\n \n\n He gestures dismissively to the door. “Unless Emily improves dramatically, you’ll be receiving a letter from the school. The subject should be of no surprise to you. And your actions here have only persuaded me to hasten her exit.”\n\n \n\n You stand shakily, humiliation heavy in your chest as you leave his office, Stitch’s cutting words ringing in your ears long after you close the door behind you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You take a steadying breath, meeting Stitch’s gaze calmly but firmly. “Mr. Stitch, Emily has had an incredibly difficult few months. She's moved away from everything she knew. Her friends, her home in the city. Soon after, our parents left, and her older brother went off to university.”\n\n \n\n “She’s been through a lot. It’s understandable that it’s impacted her focus and performance. I really think she deserves another chance.”\n\n \n\n You let the sincerity of your words hang in the silence between you, hoping the headmaster understands.\n\n \n\n Stitch considers you carefully, drumming his fingers as his piercing gaze assesses your words. Finally, he gives a reluctant nod.\n\n \n\n “Your argument has merit, . Phillips,” Stitch concedes, his voice measured but sympathetic. “It is true Emily has faced unusual circumstances. If you genuinely believe additional patience is warranted, then I will consider wiping her most recent results from her record.”\n\n \n\n His voice turns suddenly colder, his eyes narrowing slightly. “But understand clearly: this is Emily’s final warning. I trust you’ll ensure that she uses this second chance wisely.”\n\n \n\n You nod firmly, grateful despite the implicit threat. You quickly stand and thank him before leaving his oppressive office, the weight of responsibility pressing firmly on your shoulders.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You shift uncomfortably in your seat, searching for the right words, your voice lacking the confidence you hoped to convey. “Mr. Stitch, Emily’s just had...a rough few months. It’s been tough, leaving home, her friends - moving here. And then our parents...left. And her older brother too, he went to university.”\n\n \n\n Your explanation falters, feeling insufficient under his critical stare. \"I mean, it's understandable if she's a bit distracted, right?\"\n\n \n\n Stitch remains impassive, clearly unmoved.\n\n \n\n “I appreciate your effort to advocate for your sister, . Phillips,” he says evenly. “But Charlton maintains high standards precisely because we do not make exceptions lightly. Emily’s situation, while unfortunate, does not excuse her continued lack of effort.”\n\n \n\n He steeples his fingers, gaze hardening. “Emily will receive no special treatment. Either she improves quickly or faces the consequences. I trust I've made myself clear.”\n\n \n\n You swallow, nodding weakly, recognizing the finality in his voice. With a cold nod of dismissal, Stitch returns his attention to his papers, clearly signaling your conversation is over. You leave the office quietly, a knot of anxiety forming in your stomach. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You straighten up confidently, meeting Stitch’s cool, evaluative stare. \"Mr. Stitch, Emily’s struggles aren’t due to inability. She takes after me. She simply needs the right kind of challenge. Mathematics, for instance. I understand the syllabus here at Charlton is rigorous, but with proper support at home, Emily can easily excel.\"\n\n \n\n Leaning forward, you reference specific mathematical theories Emily has been studying, deftly outlining approaches to complex problems, and smoothly mentioning a recent syllabus you know she's found challenging. Your explanations are clear, concise, and demonstrate genuine intellectual capability. Stitch listens intently, reluctantly impressed by your precise understanding.\n\n \n\n Stitch leans back slightly, a flicker of begrudging respect crossing his face. \"It appears I've underestimated you, . Phillips. Perhaps Emily does indeed require a more intellectually stimulating environment to excel. Very well. I will allow you a short period to provide the necessary support.\"\n\n \n\n His tone hardens immediately. \"However, do not mistake my leniency for weakness. This is Emily's final warning. Ensure she takes this chance seriously.\"\n\n \n\n You thank him, relief mingling with lingering unease as you rise and exit his office, aware that you've just barely managed to secure Emily a reprieve.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You shift uneasily under Stitch’s penetrating gaze, fumbling awkwardly for something intelligent to say. \"Um... Emily, well, she's like me. Good at math, really, just needs… more challenge. I could, uh... help her... I mean, there’s... algebra and geometry, right? Numbers and...things...\"\n\n \n\n Your voice trails off painfully, your attempt to sound knowledgeable collapsing under his unforgiving scrutiny.\n\n \n\n Stitch remains silent for an uncomfortably long moment, clearly unimpressed. Finally, he sighs coldly. \"Your enthusiasm, though commendable, is hardly convincing. If your mathematical prowess is anything to go by, Emily is indeed in trouble.\"\n\n \n\n His eyes narrow, voice sharper. \"Emily must stand on her own merits. I see no reason to give her any special consideration. She will either improve immediately. Or face the consequences.\"\n\n \n\n You nod weakly, cheeks burning with embarrassment as you quickly stand and exit, painfully aware you've done little to improve Emily's precarious academic situation.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You take a deep breath, meeting Stitch's cold, expectant gaze directly. \"I'll talk to Emily myself. I'll ensure she understands how serious this is. Her performance will improve. I promise.\"\n\n \n\n Stitch remains silent for a long moment, allowing the weight of the situation to settle heavily between you. Finally, he nods slowly, his voice firm and unmistakably clear.\n\n \n\n \"See that it does, . Phillips,\" he says softly, each word carefully measured. \"Because this is Emily's last chance. There will be no further leniency.\"\n\n \n\n He gestures curtly toward the door, leaving you with no doubt that the conversation is over. You stand, feeling the weight of responsibility settle heavily on your shoulders as you quietly exit his office.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You slide your first pawn forward. Cautious. Safe.\n\n \n\n Across from you, Stitch doesn’t blink as he counters. His move is precise. Every gesture deliberate. The tapping of ivory against ivory echoes like a metronome.\n\n \n\n “Power,” he murmurs, “is not taken. It’s earned. Piece by piece. Position by position.”\n\n \n\n You lose another pawn. Magic rises from the board, a thin golden mist, drifting lazily toward the office door before seeping out through the cracks. You watch it go.\n\n \n\n “You’ll learn,” Stitch says softly, “what sacrifices matter. And which ones are simply noise.”\n\n \n\n He’s good. Too good. Your side begins to shrink. But there’s something elegant in the flow of the game. Like a call and response between you and Stitch, a current you’re being pulled into. Or like you’re dancing. But only one of you knows the steps.\n\n \n\n And then he gives you an opening.\n\n \n\n A Terrence Bishop is exposed. If you sacrifice him and let Stitch have him, he'll leave himself open to you taking one of his Knights.\n\n \n \n A Reagan.\n\n \n\n Magic hums at your fingertips as your hands flick across your pieces. The sensation troubles you. What is happening when the pieces are taken?\n\n \n\n Stitch leans in slightly. His gaze sharpens, a flicker of amusement behind his eyes.\n\n \n\n “Your move again, Miss Phillips.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You reach forward and move a pawn forward, leaving Terrence exposed. Stitch doesn’t flinch. He takes Terrence with one of his Knights, Reagan.\n\n \n\n A whisper of gold escapes the figure as Stitch casts it to the side of the board and tips it on to its side. The carving loses its vibrancy. Magic seeps from it, trailing back toward the school through the crack under the door.\n\n \n\n You stare at it. Then make the counter move, knocking the Reagan Knight off the board with a decisive gesture. \n\n \n\n Stitch watches you, a small smile forming. “Good. Some people,” he says coolly, “must be cast aside to achieve our goals. That is the nature of power.”\n\n \n\n He lifts his king’s piece lightly between his fingers, then sets it back down with care.\n\n \n\n “Don’t worry. I’m sure Terrence won’t notice your callousness. Those without power seldom see the reality of their situation.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You move to shield Terrence, shifting your defenses to close the gap. A cautious play.\n\n \n\n Stitch watches the move with the faintest of smirks. Then, with a clean sweep, he takes one of your Dennis pieces - a Knight - with one of his Bishops. Stacey.\n\n \n\n The loss sends a flicker of golden light drifting into the air, disappearing out through the office door. You stare at the Dennis carving, lying on its side next to the board. Magic seeping away.\n\n \n\n Stitch folds his hands. “A Knight lost, to retain a Bishop,” he muses. “Interesting exchange.”\n\n \n\n His eyes meet yours, unblinking. “This is what happens when sentiment clouds your thinking. You defend a lesser piece, and lose one that mattered.”\n\n \n\n His voice softens, dangerously. “I expect you to consider this carefully in your next move, Miss Phillips.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n After a few more moves, you study the board and realise you’ve created an opportunity. You are one small sacrifice away from claiming his Queen. Christina.\n\n \n\n But you’d need to leave Elizabeth exposed. Stitch would be forced to take her to avoid check. But in doing so, allow your Rook to take Christina. A tempting trade. Risk and reward balanced perfectly on the edge of your fingers. \n\n \n\n Stitch watches you closely, speaking as though reading your thoughts. “There will always be people,” he says, “who have what you deserve. The only question is: what are you willing to lose to take it?”\n\n \n\n He leans forward, voice low. “Eliminating a competitor requires precision. Nerve. You mustn’t hesitate. You mustn’t blink. You must be willing to lose the unnecessary to claim what’s rightfully yours.”\n\n \n\n You shift in your chair, the weight of the decision pressing in.\n\n \n\n Magic prickles at the edge of your vision, residual energy still hanging around the pieces cast aside.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You move one of your pawns up the board, setting the trap. Stitch looks at you, then smiles. “A shrewd move.” \n\n \n\n As expected, he takes the Elizabeth piece. You don’t hesitate. Your rook slides forward with purpose, striking down his Queen. Christina.\n\n \n\n Magic spills from the board. It slips through the air like breath, drifting toward the door. The carvings lose their luster. Christina’s smirk fades as the enchantment dies.\n\n \n\n “Queens are precious,” Stitch says, his tone neutral. “But like all pieces, they have their time. One can fall. And another will rise.”\n\n \n\n He gestures to the board and makes a subtle move at your end of the board.\n\n \n\n You blink, looking down. While you were focused on your attack, he slipped a pawn across your defense. It sits there now, on the furthest space from his end.\n\n \n\n Stitch reaches down, opens a drawer in his desk, and removes a small figure. As per the rules of the game, he swaps out the pawn with this new piece.\n\n \n\n It’s a Queen. Except it's not a carving of Christina, it's Emily.\n\n \n\n And currently, that's... you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n You move your Rook into place, shielding Elizabeth. The trap is undone. Stitch’s eyes flick toward your hand, watching it settle. He then moves the Christina Queen out of the danger zone. A clean retreat.\n\n \n \n He regards you a moment longer, then speaks. “Queens are powerful,” he says, calmly. “Adaptable. Ruthless.”\n\n \n\n He taps a finger against the side of the piece. “To dethrone a Queen, Miss Phillips, you need to be just as cutthroat as she is.”\n\n \n \n He smiles faintly.\n\n \n\n “I hope you’ll soon learn this lesson. One way… or the other.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n A few moves more. Now down to a few pieces.\n\n \n\n You study the board. A flaw in his strategy reveals itself. You can move Michelle forward. Place her right up against his King. He’ll have no choice but to take her. And when he does… your last remaining knight - Dennis - will be in a perfect position.\n\n \n\n Checkmate.\n\n \n\n Stitch watches the board with an expression that borders on hunger. \"It all comes down to this,\" he murmurs, voice low and silken. \"Victory, almost in your grasp. You can taste it, can’t you?\"\n\n \n\n His eyes flick up to yours, the slightest curve to his lips. \"You can defeat me. Win the game. But what,\" he asks softly, \"are you willing to give up to do so?\"\n\n \n\n His voice lingers in the air like expensive perfume.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n You make the move.\n\n \n\n As predicted, he takes the Queen, Michelle. You grin and move your last remaining Knight into a position to check his King. Elated, you say, \"Checkmate.\"\n\n \n\n Stitch smiles. “A game well played.”\n\n \n\n But then his tone shifts, subtle and unsettling. “Though things are sometimes not what they seem.”\n\n \n\n He gestures to the board. You glance down. And where your Knight - Dennis - should be, there’s now a Heather. Just a pawn.\n\n \n\n Stitch casually moves his King back a step. Out of danger. “The game continues,” he says. “But we are close to the end now.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You hesitate, then retreat Michelle to safety.\n\n \n\n Stitch’s expression tightens. “A pity.” He slides one of his Rooks across the board with quiet finality, pinning your King into the corner.\n\n \n\n “Unfortunate,” he murmurs, “that with so few choices, you are still unwilling to do what must be done.”\n\n \n\n His gaze lifts to meet yours. Cold. Curious. “Are you truly so sentimental that even in the face of certain defeat, you cannot see that the end justifies the means?”\n\n \n\n You shift uneasily in your seat, then move your King defensively. The board feels smaller now. Your position weaker.\n\n \n\n There are a few moves left… but it doesn’t look good.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n \n You see the opportunity.\n\n \n\n A few final, careful moves. And then you have him. You press forward with precision, threading through his defenses until his King is locked down, unable to move. You lean back slightly, heart pounding. \"Checkmate.\"\n\n \n\n Stitch smiles. A rare, unreadable thing. He gently flicks his King onto its side. The magic from the board rises from the piece, then towards Stitch. It flows into him, his posture stiffening for just a moment as he absorbs it. You see a flicker of something across his expression. Pain? Power? Clarity?\n\n \n\n “A game well played,” he says at last. “And a reward must be given.”\n\n \n\n He folds his hands. “You’ll see your efforts reflected in your report card. I’m relieved to see you’ve taken my lessons to heart.”\n\n \n\n A beat.\n\n \n\n “I expect much from you, going forward.”\n\n \n\n He gestures toward the door.\n\n \n\n “You’re dismissed. Return to your classes. I’ll see you next time.”\n \n \n \n \n\n You hesitate a moment longer. “And about my pass?”\n\n \n\n Stitch’s gaze lingers on you. Then, without a word, he opens a drawer and retrieves a small slip. “Very well,” he says, holding it out. “Use it wisely. I won’t tolerate shenanigans from those granted leniency.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You fight for control. You try to find the gap. But after several more moves, the board falls into a deadlock. Neither side can progress.\n\n \n\n You sit back, frustration on your face. “It looks like a stalemate.”\n\n \n\n Stitch purses his lips, not hiding his disappointment. \n \n\n “You could have won,” he says. “Had you made different decisions. Committed to the right sacrifices.” He gestures to the pieces. “But instead, you hesitated. You ended with nothing.”\n\n \n\n He leans forward, his voice low. “No one respects indecision. Losing is one thing. Having victory in your grasp, and pulling away?”\n\n \n\n He shakes his head. “I’ll be docking your grades. A small reminder that hesitation has its price.”\n\n \n\n Then he waves a hand.\n\n \n\n “You’re dismissed. Return to your classes.”\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You try to mount a comeback. You scan for the opportunity. But with each move, the truth becomes harder to deny. You are outmatched. Outmaneuvered. Your King is hemmed in.\n\n \n\n “Checkmate,” Stitch says calmly, and there’s no doubt. He knew this outcome five turns ago.\n\n \n\n He looks at you for a long moment. Then nods once. “I’ll accept that I’m better,” he says. “But you need to work harder in order to at least compete.”\n\n \n\n You stare back down at the board. You had opportunities to do better. But the amber gaseous magic rolling around the pieces reminds you that your reluctance stemmed from something else. What is the magic doing to the fallen pieces? No amount of kudos from Stitch is worth that uncertainty. Is it?\n\n \n\n He exhales. “I expect to see you again next time. Ready to learn from your mistakes.”\n\n \n\n A pause. Then he gestures toward the door.\n\n \n\n “You’re dismissed. Return to your classes.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n\n You take your seat and begin the match, fingers moving confidently over the board. This time, you don't hesitate.\n\n \n\n You let Heather go early, draw out Stacey with a feint, and trade Terrence for Reagan with barely a thought. Pieces fall, and with each sacrifice, magic wisps upward, curling like incense smoke and drifting under the door.\n\n \n\n Stitch watches you, his expression unreadable. But you can sense something simmering under the surface. A flicker of satisfaction, perhaps. Or amusement. Or something darker.\n\n \n\n You press the advantage, force Christina into a trap she can’t escape, and corner his King before he can recover.\n\n \n\n You lean back. “Checkmate.”\n\n \n\n For a moment, Stitch says nothing. Then he smiles. Not warm. But pleased.\n\n \n\n “You’re learning,” he says. “Finally. Ruthless, efficient, effective.”\n\n \n\n He taps a finger against the side of his fallen King. Like the rest of the pieces, you see the magic drift from it into Stitch. You just see him flinch as it hits his torso.\n\n \n\n “A winning game doesn’t preserve. It eliminates,\" he says. “You’ve earned your reward. You’ll see it reflected in your academic record.”\n\n \n \n \n\n You hesitate a moment longer. “And about my pass?”\n\n \n\n Stitch’s gaze lingers on you. Then, without a word, he opens a drawer and retrieves a small slip. “Very well,” he says, holding it out. “Use it wisely. I won’t tolerate shenanigans from those granted leniency.”\n\n \n \n\n A pause. Then, “You’re dismissed.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You play cautiously. Not weakly, but carefully. You protect Michelle. Guard Elizabeth. When the opportunity comes to take Reagan, you hesitate briefly. Ultimately though, you strike. You can’t afford not to.\n\n \n\n But when it comes to your own pieces you're more cautious. Once, Christina threatens your King. You block her quickly, not bait her into a trap. You play for space, not for power.\n\n \n\n Magic still escapes the board, just not as often. But still enough to cause you anxiety about where its journey ends.\n\n \n\n Stitch watches you through it all, increasingly impassive.\n\n \n\n Eventually, the game settles. You know before you say it. “Stalemate.”\n\n \n\n Stitch exhales through his nose. Disappointed. “You had the path,” he says quietly. “You saw it. But you blinked. You compromised.”\n\n \n\n He closes the board with care, but his gaze never leaves you. “Victory does not favour the cautious, Miss Phillips. Especially when hesitation costs more than failure.”\n\n \n\n He leans back, letting out a slow and deliberate sigh. “I’ll be adjusting your grades accordingly. Perhaps next time, you’ll learn to finish what you start.”\n\n \n\n A pause. Then, “You’re dismissed.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You move defensively. Always defensively. Each time an opportunity appears, you pull back. You let Stitch take Elizabeth without consequence. When Reagan emerges, you retreat Michelle.\n\n \n\n You watch as he clears your board methodically, piece by piece. A few golden strands of magic drift into the air, but not many. You haven’t sacrificed. You’ve simply… given in.\n\n \n\n Stitch finishes with a single, clean motion. “Checkmate,” he says. Not triumphant. Not surprised. Just inevitable.\n\n \n\n He folds the board shut with a faint click. “There’s a mercy in knowing one’s limits,” he says quietly. “But make no mistake. There’s no honour in surrender.”\n\n \n\n Stitch’s eyes flick to you, cold and cutting. “You are capable of more. You just chose not to be.”\n\n \n\n He waves a hand in dismissal. “Leave. And reflect on what this loss has cost you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You clear your throat as you settle in the chair. “Sir, before we begin… I was wondering about the possibility of obtaining a hall pass.”\n\n \n\n Stitch’s gaze sharpens slightly, though his body doesn’t move. “A curious request,” he says. “One not typically made so boldly.”\n\n \n\n “I just mean,” you add quickly, “I’ve been doing well in lessons. Geography, Biology. I don’t feel like I’m gaining anything new. I was hoping I could use the time more productively. For private study.”\n\n \n\n A long silence sets in. Stitch taps a single fingertip on the desk. “A commendable pursuit, if sincere,\" he finally says. \"Though I confess, Miss Phillips, I hadn’t thought your ambitions would manifest as contempt for the curriculum so early.”\n\n \n\n You blink. “I don’t mean contempt -\"\n\n \n\n “No?” he interrupts. “You claim to have outgrown your teachers. That is contempt, even if dressed as progress. But I am not one to discourage callous realism.”\n\n \n\n He leans back, folding his hands. “If your time is wasted in those rooms, then it should be better spent elsewhere. But such autonomy is not given lightly. Nor cheaply.”\n\n \n\n You pause. “I just thought high-performing students might be… rewarded.”\n\n \n\n He regards you for a long moment. “They are,” he says at last. “But not always in the manner they expect.”\n\n \n\n “Let us make an arrangement,” he says, voice smooth. “Beat me and I shall consider you eligible for exemption from the lesser aspects of our syllabus.”\n\n \n\n He places his hands atop the board, letting its magic shimmer between you.\n\n \n\n “A pass,” he says, the corner of his mouth curling faintly, “should go only to those who know how to seize opportunity when it appears.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>",

    "text": "At the mention of the word, Terrence's alert eyes bounce from side to side, looking up and down the street. “Nervous? No reason. Why?”\n\n \n\n “You seem a little on edge,” you try. “Is everything alright?”\n\n \n\n Terrence gives you a look, indecision clear in his expression. Just as he looks set to speak, a pigeon coos, making him jump.\n\n \n\n “It’s nothing,” he replies quickly. “I’m fine.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “I didn’t expect to see you in detention,” you tell him. “What happened?”\n\n \n\n He leans back with a confident grin, arms casually crossed. “I was just keeping things interesting,” he says, voice smooth. “Got caught writing Chantelle a note. Apparently Geography isn't the place to be writing to girls.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “I didn't know you liked Chantelle?”\n\n \n\n Terrence steps closer, gaze locked on you. “Why, are you jealous?\" He chuckles, sensing your unease. \"Just some harmless flirting. Geography’s a snooze anyway. Mountains and rivers aren't as interesting as girls. So detention's totally worth it if it means getting to talk to someone who actually keeps my attention.” His smile flickers with genuine interest. “Like you.”\n\n \n\n \"And it was worth detention for that?\" \n\n \n\n He nods, smirking. “She made me spend an hour writing lines on the board. ‘Men's minds are for places and history. Women can afford to daydream.’ Over and over again.”\n\n \n\n As he says the words, he chuckles. \"It's nonsense, but I can handle her. My grades are improving, anyway.”\n\n \n\n You smile, unsure you know the person in front of you.\n \n \n “I didn’t expect to see you in detention,” you tell him. “What happened?”\n\n \n\n “I misbehaved,” he tells you, his words straining through clenched teeth.\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “What did you do?” \n\n \n\n “I…” Terrence begins, but seems to change his mind. “I shouldn’t discuss it.”\n\n \n\n “It’s alright,” you assure him. “I won’t tell.”\n\n \n\n He looks at you, then sighs with exhaustion. “It’s just that – it’s such nonsense. All I did was ask if the people in other countries were happy with being conquered. She threw her book at me. Literally.”\n\n \n\n You give him a look. “She gave you detention for asking that?” \n\n \n\n He nods, growing angry with his words. “She made me spend an hour writing lines on the board. ‘Men don’t negotiate. They subjugate.’ Over and over again.”\n\n \n\n As he says the words, he gives you a look. You notice his eyes flick over your body. He takes a stifled breath. “I hate her,” he mutters. “It’s such bullshit.”\n\n \n\n Terrence seems to suddenly realise who he’s talking to and blushes. “Oh! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to say that! That word!” \n\n \n\n You smile, trying to assure him no offence was taken.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “I’ve been wondering,” you begin. “What are the boys’ versions of the single-sex classes like?”\n\n \n\n Terrence chuckles, leaning back on the pillar with casual ease. “Honestly? It’s all pep talks. ‘How to be a man’ this, ‘stand your ground’ that.” He glances at you, grin lighting his eyes. “Meanwhile, I’m stuck thinking about you and whatever the girls are up to in your classes.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow, letting his comment slide. “So you don’t buy into it?”\n\n \n\n He shakes his head, stepping closer. “Not at all. I’d trade every push-up for a real conversation. Especially if it’s with you.”\n \n \n “I’ve been wondering,” you begin. “What are the boys' versions of the single-sex classes like?”\n\n \n\n Terrence rolls his eyes, momentarily distracted from his nervous disposition of looking up and down the road. “It’s exactly what you’d expect. Macho posturing. Sexist stereotypes. How to be a man.”\n\n \n\n “You don’t agree with it?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He snorts quietly. “That’s not how my world operates.” \n\n \n\n “I’m curious to see it,” you reply.\n\n \n\n “You shouldn’t be,” he says, a touch of a warning in his voice. “I’m serious.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “Hey Terrence,” you say. “I was wondering if you could do me a favour.”\n\n \n\n He lifts his chin, confidence in his stance. “Anything for you. What’s up?”\n\n \n\n “I need to get into Geography class,” you explain. “Without Prichard.”\n\n \n\n He grins. “Distract her? The only time I’ve ever seen her leave someone unattended is when you distracted her when I had detention.”\n\n \n\n You let one of your eyebrows rise up. He catches sight of it, then shakes his head furiously. \n\n \n\n “Just get her attention for a moment,” you say. “I’m sure something will come to mind. I’ll owe you one.”\n\n \n\n \n \n He tilts his head, eyes lighting up. “Speaking of owing. I heard you aced the Math test. Is that true?”\n\n \n\n “Pretty solid,” you admit with a small smile. “Why do you ask?”\n\n \n\n He steps closer, lowering his voice. “I could use a tutor. Mr. Rogers is merciless.”\n\n \n\n “You want me to help?” you ask.\n\n \n\n His grin turns earnest. “Yeah, meet me at your place after school? And I can handle Prichard.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n He shrugs, giving you a playful look. “Funny thing. I was wondering if you could do me a favour. Math’s kicking my butt.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “You need help?”\n\n \n\n “Big time,” he admits, running a hand through his hair. “Think you could tutor me at your place? In return, I’ll make Prichard look the other way.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n “Hey Terrence,” you say. “I was wondering if you could do me a favour.”\n\n \n\n His eyes focus sharply on you, before looking around the street. “What?” he stammers. \n\n \n\n “I need to get into Geography class,” you tell him. “Without Prichard.”\n\n \n\n “That's impossible,” he replies. “The only time I’ve ever seen her leave someone unattended is when you distracted her when I had detention.”\n\n \n\n You let one of your eyebrows rise up. He catches sight of it, then shakes his head furiously. \n\n \n\n “Just get her attention for a moment,” you say. “I’m sure something will come to mind. I’ll owe you one.”\n \n \n\n \n \n He looks at you for a moment, his eyes narrowing. After a long moment he begins to talk in a measured voice. “I guess you did help me. When I had my panic attack. And I need a bit of help on Maths anyway.”\n\n \n\n You give him a look. “What's maths got to do with it?”\n\n \n\n “I’m failing,” he says, with a hint of embarrassment. “Mr. Rogers is not nice. To me. I could do with help. A lot of it.”\n\n \n\n “You want me to tutor you?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He nods eagerly. “Do that, and I’ll distract Prichard. When the time comes. I can’t fail Maths. I won’t.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n \n He looks at you for a moment, his eyes narrowing. After a long moment he begins to talk in a measured voice. “I heard you did well on your Maths test. Is that true?”\n\n \n\n You give him a look. “Pretty good,” you say casually. “Why?”\n\n \n\n “I’m failing,” he says, with a hint of embarrassment. “Mr. Rogers is not nice. To me. I could do with help. A lot of it.”\n\n \n\n “You want me to tutor you?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He nods eagerly. “Do that, and I’ll distract Prichard. When the time comes. I can’t fail Maths. I won’t.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n He looks at you for a moment, but sighs sadly. “The only thing I need a favour for is getting through Maths,” he tells you. “I hear you did about as well on the last test as I did, though.”\n\n \n\n You grimace, recalling how the clock absorbed your attention in the first maths class you took as Emily. If only he knew what I did for a living…\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry,” he tells you quietly. “It’s too risky. I can’t afford to get into any more trouble.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n “Hey Terrence,” you say. “I was wondering if you could do me a favour.”\n\n \n\n He lifts his chin, confidence in his stance. “I'm not putting your camera where it doesn't belong, Dennis.\"\n\n \n\n You wince, trying not to think of what he meant by that. “I need to get into geography class,” you explain. “Without Prichard.”\n\n \n\n He grins. “Want to capture some shots of Geography? That's weird, Dennis. Even for you.”\n\n \n\n \"Come on, Terrence,\" you try. \"I just need to get into that room.\"\n \n \n\n He chuckles. \"Sorry, mate. I'm not sticking my neck out. Even for you.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “Hey Terrence,” you say. “I was wondering if you could do me a favour.”\n\n \n\n His eyes focus sharply on you, before looking around the street. “What?” he stammers. \n\n \n\n “I need to get into geography class,” you tell him. “Without Prichard.”\n\n \n\n “That's impossible,” he replies. “The only time I’ve ever seen her leave someone unattended is when you distracted her when I had detention.”\n\n \n\n You let one of your eyebrows rise up. He catches sight of it, then shakes his head furiously. \n\n \n\n “Just get her attention for a moment,” you say. “I’m sure something will come to mind. I’ll owe you one.”\n\n \n \n He looks at you for a moment, his eyes narrowing. After a long moment he begins to talk in a measured voice. “You're pretty good at maths, aren't you?”\n\n \n\n You shrug, trying to gauge the right response. “Yeah,” you say casually. “Why?”\n\n \n\n “I’m failing,” he says, with a hint of embarrassment. “Mr. Rogers is not nice. To me. I could do with help. A lot of it.”\n\n \n\n “You want me to tutor you?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He nods eagerly. “I can come over to your place. Any evening. You can help, can't you?\"\n\n \n\n You briefly consider risking it, but you're not sure how long Dennis will be asleep. Nor whether you can get away with going home as him. It seems risky. Too risky.\n\n \n\n \"Sorry, Terrence,\" you say. \"I can't at the moment.\"\n \n \n\n “I understand,” Terrence replies. “It’s a busy time, the end of the year. Lots of study. Everyone’s trying to graduate.”\n\n \n\n A car with a loud exhaust drives past and Terrence’s attention is taken away momentarily. When he returns to focus on you, he seems twitchy and nervous once more. “I need to go. My mum will be waiting for me. But the offer still stands. If you want my help, I can come over.\"\n\n \n\n You watch Terrence walk off quickly, almost tripping as he rushes to move away from the school.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n\n \n “Thank you!” Terrence says, stepping closer. As he reaches for your hand, his fingers brush yours in a deliberate, confident shake. His grip is warm and steady. “You have no idea how much this means,” he murmurs, gaze flickering to your lips before meeting your eyes again. “Phone me when you get home tonight. I’ll be there faster than you can say ‘Geography’.”\n\n \n\n He fishes a pen and notebook from his backpack, then scribbles his number with a quick, practiced flourish. Tearing off the page, he presses it into your palm, thumb lingering against your skin. “It’s a landline, so if someone picks up, just say you’re a friend from school.”\n\n \n\n You slip the paper into your satchel. \n\n \n\n “Perfect,” he says, raking a hand through his hair and offering you a slow, easy grin. He gives a small nod, then turns on his heel, shoulders relaxed. “Talk soon?”\n\n \n “Thank you!” Terrence stammers, reaching for your hand and shaking it rapidly. “Thank you so much. Give me a call in the evening when you get home. I'll come right over.\" \n\n \n\n “Oh!” he adds, reaching into his backpack and pulling out a pen and notebook from a compartment. He scribbles down his phone number and rips off a sheet to give to you. “Here’s my number. It’s a landline. If my mom answers, just pretend to be a salesman. Or woman.” He seems to consider this for a moment. “Actually. Just say you’re a girl. From school.”\n\n \n\n You nod, putting the paper in your satchel. \n\n \n\n “Alright,” he says, running his hand through his hair. “I better get home. Prepare. Give me a call.”\n\n \n\n Terrence smiles politely, then strides off, his eyes tracking every sound and movement as he goes. \n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “Ah, playing hard to get, are we?” Terrence teases, feigning a dramatic sigh. “End-of-year crunch. Can’t blame you.” He takes a step closer, grin teasing. “But don’t think you’re rid of me. If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me. About tutoring. Or anything else.\"\n\n \n\n He winks, then turns on his heel and strides off with easy confidence, shoulders relaxed and eyes still on you as he goes.\n \n \n “I understand,” Terrence tells you. “It’s a busy time, the end of the year. Lots of study. Everyone’s trying to graduate.”\n\n \n\n A car with a loud exhaust drives past and Terrence’s attention is taken away momentarily. When he returns to focus on you, he seems twitchy and nervous once more. “I need to go. My mum will be waiting for me. But the offer still stands. If you want my help, come see me. I think Prichard’s keeping me back a lot for what I said.”\n\n \n\n You watch Terrence walk off quickly, almost tripping as he rushes to move away from the school.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You step toward Terrence, holding your test paper in one hand as you try to calm his obvious nerves. \"Terrence, I know you’re struggling, but I really can help,\" you say, your voice steady. \"I’ve got the grades to prove it.\"\n\n \n\n Terrence fidgets with the edge of his textbook, not quite meeting your eyes. \"Y-you want to tutor me?\" he stammers, his voice pitching slightly. \"I mean, sure, I’m failing, but that doesn’t mean just anyone can help.\" He pulls at the collar of his shirt as though it’s suddenly too tight. \"Didn’t you, uh... didn’t you fail that last test too?\"\n\n \n\n You calmly pull out some of your most recent work, holding it out for him to see. His hands tremble slightly as he takes it, his eyes darting across the page. \"Oh,\" he mutters, blinking rapidly. \"Wow. That’s... that’s actually really good.\" He bites his lip, then quickly hands the paper back, like he’s worried someone might see it.\n\n \n\n \"Okay, uh... yeah,\" he says, nodding a bit too quickly. \"I guess you could... I mean, you seem like you know what you’re doing. I just - I need help, okay? But not in a way that makes it, you know, obvious. People might, uh... get the wrong idea.\"\n\n \n\n He glances over his shoulder nervously, his voice dropping to a whisper. \"We can meet somewhere quiet, right? Maybe your home? After school. Just studying. I didn't mean... I mean. Not that.\" His words come in a rapid-fire burst, and he’s already packing up his books like he’s ready to flee. \"Don’t tell anyone, okay? Just - just keep it between us.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \"Terrence, I’ve been going over my math notes,\" you say, pulling out a stack of papers. \"I know I can help you. Look, I’ve even written out the solutions!\"\n\n \n\n Terrence hesitates, his fingers twitching nervously at the edge of his desk. \"Uh... okay,\" he says, his voice shaky. \"Let me see, I guess?\" He reaches out cautiously as if the papers might bite him.\n\n \n\n He stares at the top sheet, tilting his head slightly as his eyes dart over your handwriting. \"Wait... is this a quadratic equation?\" he asks, his brow furrowing. \"Why is the answer a heart?\"\n\n \n\n You glance down at the paper. \"Oh, that’s not an apple. That’s an approximation symbol.\"\n\n \n\n Terrence looks up at you, his mouth slightly open, before shifting his gaze back to the page. He flips to another sheet, where an answer is circled three times and underlined with a question mark. \"And, uh... what’s going on here? Did you... change your answer? Three times?\"\n\n \n\n \"That’s just me double-checking my work,\" you reply, trying to sound confident.\n\n \n\n \"Uh-huh.\" Terrence nods, his lips twitching as he flips to the next page. \"And this one?\" He points to a graph where the axes are mislabeled. \"Did you just... label time as ‘Taco Tuesday’? Why is ‘joy’ the other axis?\"\n\n \n\n \"Okay, that one was just a shorthand to help me visualize the problem,\" you mumble.\n\n \n\n Terrence exhales sharply, clutching the papers like they’re the punchline to a very strange joke. His shoulders start to shake as he lets out a nervous giggle, which quickly grows into a full-on laugh. \"Wow,\" he gasps, wiping his eyes. \"I mean, I’m failing math, but this... this is something else. You’re really sure you’re the one who’s going to help me?\"\n\n \n\n You open your mouth to respond, but he’s already shaking his head, the laughter tapering off into nervous chuckles. \"Thanks, but, uh... I think I’ll figure it out on my own. Or maybe get a tutor who knows why time isn’t a taco.\"\n\n \n\n He quickly gathers his books, muttering to himself as he hurries off. \"Taco Tuesday,\" he repeats under his breath, still snickering. \"Unreal.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n “Your mum sounded happy when I called,” you say.\n\n \n\n He offers you a confident smile, settling into his chair. “She’s not used to me chatting away with girls on the line. But talking to you? I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”\n\n \n\n \"I'm here to tutor you, Terrence,\" you tell him. \"This isn't a date.”\n\n \n\n Terrence’s confident smile wavers. “Right… sorry, Em. She's just not used to me getting calls from pretty girls.”\n\n \n\n You shift, gathering your notes. “Let’s stick to maths, okay?”\n\n \n “Your mother seemed surprised when I called,” you tell him casually. \n\n \n\n “I don’t get many callers,” he replies. “Especially not from girls at school.”\n\n \n\n You give him a curious look. “Not popular with the girls?”\n\n \n\n “Oh no,” he says, smiling. “I have a lot of friends. Just -” He breaks off his sentence before he can complete it. “I don’t really date.”\n\n \n\n You eye Terrence for a moment, sensing his reluctance to embellish. You wonder if you should push further, or return to the safer topic of Maths.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n “You’re pretty smart, you know,” you tell him. “How come you are struggling at school?”\n\n \n\n He shrugs, leaning casually against the table. “Honestly? I stopped seeing the point. All these books and lessons… I’d rather be out having fun, chasing girls while we’re young.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “What about after school? Your future?”\n\n \n\n He waves a hand dismissively. “It’ll sort itself out. Life’s not one big exam.” He steps closer, grin teasing. “Don’t you think it would be nice to take a break from all these equations and have a little fun?”\n\n \n\n You mutter under your breath, “Sounds like you fit right in at Charlton.”\n\n \n\n Terrence laughs, eyes sparkling. “Funny. The same guys used to pick on me for not having a girlfriend. But ever since I stopped caring what they think… they’ve backed off.” He offers you a confident look. “Maybe I could take you out one evening. Away from textbooks?”\n\n \n\n You clear your throat. “Let’s stick to tutoring for now.”\n\n \n\n Terrence leans in, grin unwavering. “Sure, but I’ll definitely wear you down eventually.”\n \n \n “You’re pretty smart, you know,” you tell him. “How come you are struggling at school?”\n\n \n\n He glances up from his textbook, pen hovering as he breaks from work. “I don’t know. Maybe it’s the teachers. They don’t really like me.”\n\n \n\n “Like Mr. Rogers?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n He nods, rapidly. “Him. And the others. They make fun of me. Call me names. It’s called a pecking order.”\n\n \n\n You frown, feeling yourself lean in slightly. “What sort of names?”\n\n \n\n He eyes you carefully, tense and guarded. “They say…” he tries, breaking off. “They mock me. For not having a girlfriend.”\n\n \n\n An eyebrow rises above your right eye. “Not popular with the girls?”\n\n \n\n “Oh no,” he says, smiling. “I have a lot of friends. Just –” He breaks off his sentence before he can complete it. “I don’t really date.”\n\n \n\n You eye Terrence for a moment, sensing his reluctance to embellish. You wonder if you should push further, or return to the safer topic of maths.\n\n <>\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n You decide to focus your attention on Terrence’s studies. He flips open another notebook and begins copying down equations in neat, mechanical strokes. But just enough to keep up appearances. His brow never furrows in real concentration. Instead, his gaze drifts up to meet yours whenever he thinks you’re not watching. \n\n \n \n A sudden thought tugs at you. Terrence is more interested in you than studying.\n\n \n\n You shake off the distraction and guide him through the final problem. He scribbles the answer quickly, then closes the notebook with a soft snap. “Thanks, Emily,” he says quietly, voice low. “Everything’s simple now.”\n\n \n\n “So you’ll help distract Prichard if I end up in detention?” you ask.\n\n \n\n Terrence straightens, meets your eyes with a warm grin. “Absolutely. Whenever you need me.”\n \n \n\n He stacks his books neatly, tucks them under one arm with ease, and strides toward the door without a hint of hesitation. You open it for him; the cool night air tousles his hair. A pigeon’s soft coo draws a playful grin instead of a startled jump.\n\n \n\n “Goodnight, Emily,” he says, tipping his head and holding your gaze for a brief moment before turning to walk away with confident steps.\n\n \n You decide to focus your attention on Terrence’s studies. He is a fast learner and before you anticipated he’s completing exercises that an hour ago were beyond his comprehension.\n\n \n\n Finding a degree of pride in your efforts, you give him an encouraging smile. When he returns it, you only see gratitude behind the gesture.\n\n \n\n Something gnaws away and you have a small epiphany. In all of your experience since coming to Charlton, Terrence is the first man not looking at you with any degree of lust.\n\n Something gnaws away and you have a small epiphany. In all your recent experiences of being in a girl’s body, Terrence is the first man not looking at you with any degree of lust.\n\n \n\n You feel a little sting. A twinge of wounded pride inside your brain. You can think of a few reasons to counter the incoming thought that you can’t suppress. Why doesn’t he like me?\n\n \n\n Returning your focus to his studies, you wrap up the tutoring as he completes the final task. \"Thanks, Emily,\" he says quietly. \"It's simple. All simple now.\"\n\n \n\n “So you’ll help distract Prichard?” you ask him. “If I’m in detention?”\n\n \n\n “I don’t know why you’d want to do that,” he replies. “Believe me. I know. But yes. Okay. If you need me, I’ll be there.”\n\n \n\n Terrence packs up his books into a stack and awkwardly walks towards the front door, holding them in both hands. You open the door for him. His eyes become alert as soon as he sees night has set in. The sound of a pigeon cooing almost causes him to drop his pile of books to the floor.\n\n \n\n \"Goodnight, Emily,\" he tells you, as he leaves. You watch him move down the street with as much speed as he can muster. \n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n “Would you like to date, though?” you press him. “Is there anyone at school you like?”\n\n \n\n Terrence’s confident smile flickers with mischief. “I do now,” he replies, leaning in close. His eyes drop to your lips before returning to your gaze. “Actually, I’ve been thinking about you.”\n\n \n\n Without warning, he leans in and presses his lips to yours. Sure, warm, and deliberate. For a heartbeat, you’re caught off guard by the boldness and the spark of his confidence.\n\n \n\n You pull back, heart racing. “Terrence, I… I don’t want that.”\n\n \n\n He straightens, grin unwavering. “That’s just a maybe later. I bet I’ll win you over for a date soon.”\n\n \n\n \"I don't think so,\" you tell him.\n\n \n\n He chuckles. \"We'll see.\"\n \n \n\n Terrence slides his chair back and scoops up his books. \"Thanks, Em,\" he stammers. \"It's been fun. I'll keep an eye out for you. If you’re ever in detention. Or elsewhere.”\n\n \n\n “Terrence…” you begin.\n\n \n\n But he's already heading toward the door. He pauses in the frame, hand on the knob. “Goodnight, Emily,” he calls softly, then strides off with relaxed confidence.\n\n \n\n You watch his silhouette fade down the hallway, still feeling the warmth of his touch on your lips.\n \n \n “Would you like to date, though?” you press him. “Is there anyone at school you like?\"\n\n \n\n He takes a deep breath. His eyes roam around the room, as if looking for some way to escape. \n\n \n\n “I don’t know,” he stammers. \n\n \n\n You brace yourself to ask the question that bubbles up in your mind. “But you do like girls, right?” \n\n \n\n He looks down at the table, not meeting your eye. He shrugs. “I don’t know.”\n\n \n\n A long moment of silence draws out between you two before he looks up again. You give him a sympathetic smile. “That’s okay,” you say quietly. “It’s okay not to know.”\n\n \n\n “That’s not what they say at school,” he replies, with a rush of words threatening to merge into one another. “Girls are made for boys. Boys should like girls. I must like girls.”\n\n \n\n You see the tears in his eyes. “You don’t have to,” you tell him. \n\n \n\n He shakes his head. “I should. I do. Of course I do. Girls are made for boys. I should go.”\n\n \n\n Terrence slides his chair back and scoops up his books. \"Thanks, Emily,\" he stammers. \"You've been helpful. I'll keep an eye out for you. If you’re ever in detention.”\n\n \n\n “Terrence…” you begin.\n\n \n\n “Thank you. Again,” he says, rushing to the door. Awkwardly, he can’t open it with a stack of books in his arms and you have to pull it for him. Terrence nods in appreciation, then bounds out the door.\n\n \n\n You watch him go. He doesn’t look back. \n\n <>\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n “I’ve noticed Britney, Stacey and Reagan hanging around you,” you say. “Everything okay?”\n\n \n\n Terrence hesitates. His eyes flick around like he’s checking for witnesses. Then he exhales, voice low.\n\n \n\n “They’ve... been kind,” he says. “Said they understand what I’m going through.”\n\n \n\n You tilt your head. “What exactly do they understand?”\n\n \n\n He fidgets, glancing down at his shoes. “The pressure. The teasing. They thought maybe they could help.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “The cheerleaders? Understanding bullying? Aren’t they usually the ones doing it?”\n\n \n\n “You don’t get it,” he snaps, louder than he means to. His voice drops again. “They’re listening to me! They know what it's like… to be different.”\n\n \n\n You wait. He looks like he wants to say more, but swallows it down.\n\n \n\n “I don’t think Chrissie and her friends have your best interests at heart,” you tell him flatly.\n\n \n\n “You sound like…” he begins, then trails off. “Look, it's fine, Emily. I can handle it.”\n\n \n\n Watching Terrence carefully, you nod. There's a degree of assertiveness bubbling underneath the surface of all that nervousness that you haven't seen before.\n\n \n “I’ve noticed Britney, Stacey and Reagan hanging around you,” you say. “Everything okay?”\n\n \n\n Terrence hesitates. His eyes flick around like he’s checking for witnesses. Then he exhales, voice low.\n\n \n\n “They’ve... been kind,” he says. “Said they understand what I’m going through.”\n\n \n\n You tilt your head. “What exactly do they understand?”\n\n \n\n He fidgets, glancing down at his shoes. “The pressure. The teasing. They thought maybe they could help.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “The cheerleaders? Understanding bullying? Aren’t they usually the ones doing it?”\n\n \n\n “Yes! But I mean, no!” he snaps, louder than he means to. His voice drops again. “They’re listening to me, Dennis! They actually know what it's like… to be different.”\n\n \n\n You wait. He looks like he wants to say more, but swallows it down.\n\n \n\n “I don’t think Chrissie and her friends have your best interests at heart,” you tell him flatly.\n\n \n\n “You sound like…” he begins, then trails off. “Look, it’s fine. I can handle it.”\n\n \n\n Watching Terrence carefully, you nod. There's a degree of assertiveness bubbling underneath the surface of all that nervousness that you haven't seen before.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n “Hey Terrence, do you know a woman called Jennifer Chambers?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n His eyes flicker, panic rising. He swallows hard. “No,” he says, voice barely above a whisper.\n\n \n\n You press on, gaze steady. “Are you sure?”\n\n \n\n He looks down at the floor, then back at you. “I’m sure.”\n\n \n\n You lift an eyebrow. “Then why would she have your landline?”\n\n \n\n His face goes pale. He stammers, unable to meet your eyes. “I… I don't know,” he mutters, stepping back. His eyes dart around and you sense he's not going to say anything more about whatever connects Jen with him.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n “Hey Terrence, do you know a woman called Jennifer Chambers?” you ask him.\n\n \n\n His eyes flicker, panic rising. He swallows hard. “No,” he says, voice barely above a whisper.\n\n \n\n You press on, gaze steady. “Are you sure?”\n\n \n\n He looks down at the floor, then back at you. “I’m sure.”\n\n \n\n You lift an eyebrow. “Then why would she have your landline?”\n\n \n\n His face goes pale. He stammers, unable to meet your eyes. “I… I don't know,” he mutters, stepping back. \"How do you know that, Dennis?\"\n\n \n\n For a moment his eyes start darting around, focusing on you. Even when you shrug, his narrowed eyes don't ever leave you. That is, until a pigeon cooing makes him jump.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n\n You glance up from the workbook between you, letting your voice stay casual. “So the cheerleaders. They’ve been paying you a lot of attention recently. Are they helping you too?”\n\n \n\n Terrence pauses, pencil mid-air. “They just… talk to me.”\n\n \n\n “About studying?”\n\n \n\n He gives a short laugh. “No. Not school stuff. Not really. More like... attitude. Standing up straighter. Smiling more.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. “So, motivational cheerleading.”\n\n \n\n He shrugs. “I guess.”\n\n \n\n You glance down at his notebook. You flick back a few pages, sensing his unease as you do so. His answers for biology stand out. Precise and succinct. Nothing like the confused guesswork you saw the week before.\n\n \n\n “You’re doing better. Especially in Biology.”\n\n \n\n That makes him stiffen. He reaches for his pencil again, head ducked.\n\n \n\n “I’ve just been… paying more attention.”\n\n \n\n “Christina and Britney helping you to study?”\n\n \n\n “No,” he says quickly. Too quickly.\n\n \n\n Your eyes flick to his bag. The flap’s half open, and you spot one exercise book he’s kept off the table. A worn biology book, stuffed with cuttings and sheets from note paper. \n\n \n\n He sees your gaze, and with a quick movement, flips the flap over the bag. “Biology's not what I'm here for. It’s it’s all… starting to make sense now.”\n\n \n\n “Biology?” you ask.\n\n \n\n He shakes his head. “It doesn’t matter.”\n\n \n\n His hand rests on the flap of his bag now. Protective. You study him a moment longer. Whatever’s in that book, he doesn’t want you seeing it. You’re going to have to find another way to see it. Perhaps you can find a way to open his locker during the day, when he's occupied.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n “Do you know how I could get a hall pass?” you ask.\n\n \n\n He raises an eyebrow at you, clearly amused. “Skipping class? Emily, I thought you were a good girl.”\n\n \n\n You fold your arms. “I’m serious.”\n\n \n\n He chuckles. “Alright, alright.” He leans in a little, conspiratorial. “Stitch gives them out sometimes. But only to students who do well in lessons. Top of the class. Model behaviour. If you get special lessons from Stitch, you can get privileges.”\n\n \n\n You nod, already considering your grades, but then he adds with a grin, \"Personally, I don’t think you need to worry about studying. There are more fun ways to spend your time.”\n\n \n\n He leans back, watching you with interest. “I could show you some of them, Em.”\n \n \n “Hey, Terrence,” you begin. “Do you know how someone could get a hall pass?”\n\n \n\n He blinks. “A… pass? I guess maybe from Mr. Stitch? He gives them out sometimes.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “Based on what?”\n\n \n\n Terrence adjusts his bag strap. “Grades, mostly. If you’re doing well. He notices that stuff. You’ve got to stand out, but he invites all his favourites for extra lessons. They all seem to avoid trouble if they’re seen out of classes.”\n\n \n\n You nod slowly. “Have you done those lessons?”\n\n \n\n He hesitates, then shakes his head quickly. “No. I wouldn’t. Even if my grades were high enough. I don’t want to stand out to Stitch.”\n\n \n\n He lowers his voice. “It’s better to just keep your head down, Em. Trust me.”\n\n \n\n Terrence glances back at the building, eyes scanning the windows. \n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "You take a steadying breath. \"What did you need me for, sir?\"\n\n \n\n His silver eyebrows lift as he smooths a hand over his unbuttoned jacket. He stands, slowly walking around the desk. Lingering dangerously close to you. “Jenna,” he whispers. “Your performance today is…integral. In fact, your future here may well depend on it.” \n\n \n\n He leans closer, his eyes looking deeply into yours. You push back into the leather chair, trapped between its back and Terry, towering over you. “No need to be fearful,” he says, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “When we’re done. I’m about to make you a star.”\n\n \n\n With a flourish, he spins and whisks off a velvet cloth from a nearby easel… displaying a poster.\n\n \n\n [image: ./images/receipts_from_the_heart.png]\n \n \n \n A boyish grin spreads across Terry’s face. “If Selfridges can have a brand voice, why can’t we?” he enthuses. “And… why can’t it be a soprano?”\n\n \n\n You stare between Terry and the poster, your brain trying to register what you’re seeing. The stylized soprano clutching a perfume atomizer, the older gentleman gesturing behind her. Did Terry model these on Jennifer and him?\n\n \n\n Terry draws you from the image with his enthusiastic gestures, grinning with glee. “Think of it, Jenna! I’ve paid a fortune in focus groups and research. They all say the same things. Get better stock control. Sort out the tills. Mundane. Dull. Boring. I told them to go to hell.”\n\n \n\n You watch him pace the room. Almost performing a pitch. Grinning manically. “I’ve been in this business since my father set up this store,” he continues. “I can tell you what Evans' Department Store really needs isn’t better signage or modern payment systems, but…” he pauses briefly, stepping near you again. “… a retail opera experience.” \n\n \n\n And ends his pitch with jazz hands. \n\n \n\n You look up at him, your brain struggling to process what is occurring. You are thankful when there’s a knock at the door. Mary Handle peeks in. \"Just leaving,\" she murmurs. “Do you need anything?”\n\n \n \n Terry waves her off with a laugh. “Nothing. I’m simply bringing Jenna up-to-speed.”\n\n \n\n She offers you a sympathetic smile. “Enjoy,” she says, and slips away.\n\n \n\n You glance at the wall clock, time already slipping by. Terry turns, dragging your chair around to face the open floor. “Now, on to business. We’ve cast the mannequin, Jenna. But no one will sing the Refund Aria. I was hoping…” He trails off, getting lost in his own thoughts.\n\n \n\n “Well,” he says, finding his thought process again. “First let me tell you about the heroic perfume spritz girl looking for love in all the wrong departments.” He grins, leaning closer to you again. “And I’ll tell you a trade secret,” he whispers. “She reminds me of you.”\n\n \n\n You glance at the clock again. If you’re not careful, you are going to see the evening slip away.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [Citizen Charlton] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n [Citizen Charlton] <> - You feel you can't say you want to leave\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n Something in you can't say no to him. You lean forward, eager to listen to his ideas. Already hanging on his words, ready to listen to Terry’s grand plan for the department store.\n\n \n\n He dives back into his pitch, rifling through a drawer piled high with lyric sheets. He reads aloud the set list. ‘Sale Ends Sunday (But Love Is Forever)’, ‘Floor Two Fantasia (Linens & Regret),’ ‘The Till Won’t Ring Without You…’\n\n \n\n Each title blooms into a fifteen minute monologue as Terry explains the thematic through-line of his retail opera. Those minutes stretch into hours. You watch as the office clock’s hands spin forward until the glow outside has faded to night.\n\n \n\n At last, Terry’s voice trails away. He gathers up his notes with a satisfied sigh. “Oh, look at the time!” he exclaims. “Creativity does sweep you away, doesn’t it? See you tomorrow, Jenna!”\n\n \n\n He bounds from the office, leaving you alone in the dim light. The evening wasted, but you can’t bring yourself to be upset. Terry needed you as a sounding board and naturally, you said yes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You lean forward, voice soft and playful. “You know, Mr. Evans, I’m very intrigued by playing your leading lady. Are you going to be the star in the show? Or just direct me? From behind.”\n\n \n\n Terry looks startled. Taken aback. But you think you see his eyes wander over you, just for a moment, before looking curiously back at you. Then he bellows with laughter. “I always knew you had the makings of a great actress, Jenna! Such fire! Playfulness. Perfect… just perfect.”\n\n \n\n You offer a coy smile. “I do have an appointment to keep, though. Perhaps we can rehearse another time?”\n\n \n\n “Sure. Sure,” he says, nodding as he looks down at you. The grin is there, but it’s fused with something more now. Curiosity. “How about over dinner? To iron out the scene. Talk about your role.”\n\n \n\n You look up at him. Something inside twists. You’ve taken this too far, haven’t you? \n\n \n\n You tilt your head. “Perhaps.”\n\n \n\n “Excellent,” he states, as he moves away from your chair. You get up, adjusting your skirt. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Jenna,” he says. \n\n \n\n He watches you slip from the room, gaze lingering on your retreating figure. You step into the corridor, heart racing. Do you really want to set Jennifer up with Terry for dinner?\n\n \n\n *Or would you attend that too?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You lean forward, voice soft and playful. “You know, Mr. Evans, I’m very intrigued by playing your leading lady. Are you going to be the star in the show for me?”\n\n \n\n He looks back at you, frowning. The subtext missed. “I can’t star in the show and direct, Jenna,” he says, as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “I need to be driving everyone’s performance, making the show authentic. Honesty will be the key to this show’s success. I can’t get sucked into a role. If I did, who would ensure the escalator was hitting their marks?”\n\n \n\n You’re not sure how to answer that. Terry seizes the opportunity and dives back into his pitch, rifling through a drawer piled high with lyric sheets. You sigh as you realise you’ve missed your opportunity to leave.\n\n \n\n He reads aloud the set list. ‘Sale Ends Sunday (But Love Is Forever)’, ‘Floor Two Fantasia (Linens & Regret),’ ‘The Till Won’t Ring Without You…’\n\n \n\n Each title blooms into a fifteen minute monologue as Terry explains the thematic through-line of his retail opera. Those minutes stretch into hours. You watch as the office clock’s hands spin forward until the glow outside has faded to night.\n\n \n\n At last, Terry’s voice trails away. He gathers up his notes with a satisfied sigh. “Oh, look at the time!” he exclaims. “Creativity does sweep you away, doesn’t it? See you tomorrow, Jenna!”\n\n \n\n He bounds from the office, leaving you alone in the dim light. The evening wasted, you sigh.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You lift your chin. “Sir, I’m sorry, but I really must be going.”\n\n \n\n Terry’s shoulders slump in true disappointment. “Already?” he murmurs. \n\n \n\n He opens his mouth to protest further, but you smile and add, “I’m sorry, sir. It’s important. You’re a good boss, Mr. Evans. You value a good work-life balance, don’t you?”\n\n \n\n His frown brightens into a grin. “Balance… yes, yes!” He drums his fingers on the desk, thinking. “The trials and tribulations of maintaining a work life balance. Her head is at home, but her heart is in the store.” He rushes around his desk and begins scribbling. “Dear Jenna, you are my muse!”\n\n \n\n You watch him for a moment, frenziedly writing down new lyrics, muttering to himself. “Another song,” he says without looking up, “about work–life harmony… and how we so often miss the mark.”\n\n \n\n Evans then glances at you, eyes gleaming. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Jenna. I need to get these lyrics down. But we can talk tomorrow about the ballad. And who will perform it.” He flashes you a knowing smile. “I think you’ll be happy,” he says.\n\n \n\n You nod, slip past the desk, and step into the corridor, leaving him lost in his scrawl. Thankful you’ve gained your evening back.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n \n You lift your chin. “Sir, I’m sorry, but I really must be going.”\n\n \n\n Terry’s shoulders slump in true disappointment. “Already?” he murmurs. \n\n \n\n You go to protest further, but Terry cuts you off with a wave. “Just ten minutes, Jenna. That’s all I ask.”\n\n \n\n You hesitate but relent. “All right.”\n\n \n\n He grins and dives back into his pitch, rifling through a drawer piled high with lyric sheets. He reads aloud the set list. ‘Sale Ends Sunday (But Love Is Forever)’, ‘Floor Two Fantasia (Linens & Regret),’ ‘The Till Won’t Ring Without You…’\n\n \n\n Each title blooms into a fifteen minute monologue as Terry explains the thematic through-line of his retail opera. Those minutes stretch into hours. You watch as the office clock’s hands spin forward until the glow outside has faded to night.\n\n \n\n At last, Terry’s voice trails away. He gathers up his notes with a satisfied sigh. “Oh, look at the time!” he exclaims. “Creativity does sweep you away, doesn’t it? See you tomorrow, Jenna!”\n\n \n\n He bounds from the office, leaving you alone in the dim light. The evening wasted, you sigh.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You hesitate but relent. Sitting back in your seat, you settle in, ready to listen to Terry’s grand plan for the department store.\n\n \n\n He dives back into his pitch, rifling through a drawer piled high with lyric sheets. He reads aloud the set list. ‘Sale Ends Sunday (But Love Is Forever)’, ‘Floor Two Fantasia (Linens & Regret),’ ‘The Till Won’t Ring Without You…’\n\n \n\n Each title blooms into a fifteen minute monologue as Terry explains the thematic through-line of his retail opera.

    "text": "Either through fear or curiosity, you find yourself obeying. Your knees go weak and you slide your back down the door, looking up at Thompson, now standing over you.\n\n \n\n “And the dress,” he says. You nod and look down at your outfit. You pull at the dress, sliding it down your waist. You shudder as your perky large breasts pop out, exposed.\n\n \n\n You look up, meeting Thompson’s dark eyes. He grins as he meets yours, then stares at your free breasts. You feel like you’re in a dream, reality seemingly disconnected from what you can see and how you feel.\n\n \n\n He unbuckles his belt and reaches into his pants, pulling out free a girthy and thick penis, dangling in front of your face. “You want this in-between your tits, don’t you? Want to feel it. Say it.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n “No,” you say quietly, but assuredly. \n\n \n\n Thompson’s eyes flash with surprise. “What?” \n\n \n\n “I’m not doing that,” you tell him flatly. “Not now. Not ever.”\n\n \n\n He smirks, but it’s laced with menace. “Gonna’ stand me up for our lunch sessions, Annie? Think long and hard whether you want to keep your job.”\n\n \n\n “I found some interesting paperwork in your office,” you say, trying to hide the tremble in your tone. “Some things you wouldn’t want other people knowing. Especially your wife.”\n\n \n\n The smirk dissipates from his face. “Are you threatening me?” he spits.\n\n \n\n “I’m telling you,” you retort. “Leave me alone.”\n\n \n\n Thompson bares his teeth. “Give me one reason not to fire you.”\n\n \n\n You smile, matching Annie’s trademark coyness. Strangely enough, it gives you confidence. \n\n \n\n “How about two? If you don’t, I won’t tell a soul all the things I know. And second, if you do, I’ll make sure everyone who works for you leaves you. You might have noticed, I have a certain sway around here.”\n\n \n\n Thompson eyes you darkly, his presence enveloping you against the door. Despite your assertiveness, you know that you currently can’t move. \n\n \n\n \"Fine,\" he spits, taking a step back. “Just do your job. Knowing you, you’re probably saddled with diseases anyway.”\n\n \n\n “You’ll never know,” you say to him, mockingly sweet. \n\n \n\n With a buoyancy in your step, you flash him a grin and walk past him. He doesn’t make any attempt to stop you.\n\n \n\n Maybe there’s something to being a girl, after all, you think, as you walk towards the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “I was working late,” you try. \n\n \n\n “In my office?” he retorts, the volume of his voice rising. His eyes flick to Annie’s office keys in your hand. “Where did you get them? Did you steal them, Phillips?”\n\n \n\n With surprising speed, his hand launches out and grabs the keys from your hand. Then he sees the keys for the school and basement attached to the chain. “What. Are. These?!” he says, almost screaming. \n\n \n\n He leans in, face inches from your own, his open mouth full of saliva. “You ungrateful thief, Phillips,” he berates you, spitting without care as he speaks. “After all I've done for you. Giving you a job when no one else would. And you break into my office. And steal from me?”\n\n \n\n You tense up, his physique towering over your small frame. Then, just as you feel your body almost recoil, he flares his nostrils and barges past you, opening his office door.\n\n \n\n “Get out,” he tells you. “Last chance, Phillips. One more strike and find yourself a new job.”\n\n \n\n With that, the door to Thompson’s office is slammed in your face. \n \n \n “I was working late,” you try. \n\n \n\n “In my office?” he retorts, the volume of his voice rising. His eyes flick to Annie’s office keys in your hand. “Where did you get them? Did you steal them, Phillips?”\n\n \n\n With surprising speed, his hand launches out and grabs the keys from your hand. Then he sees the keys for the school and basement attached to the chain. “What. Are. These?!” he says, almost screaming. \n\n \n\n He leans in, face inches from your own, his open mouth full of saliva. “You ungrateful thief, Phillips,” he berates you, spitting without care as he speaks. “After all I've done for you. Giving you a job when no one else would. And you break into my office. And steal from me?”\n\n \n\n You tense up, anticipating a physical confrontation. But instead he flares his nostrils at you and barges past you, opening his office door.\n\n \n\n “Get out,” he tells you. “Last chance, Phillips. One more strike and find yourself a new job.”\n\n \n\n With that, the door to Thompson’s office is slammed in your face. \n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You hear yourself mumble that you do.\n\n \n\n “Yes, what?” Thompson asks you.\n\n \n\n You understand his question and answer meekly. “Yes sir.”\n\n \n\n He smiles. “Good. Now, work those tits of yours.”\n\n \n\n Almost robotically, you arch up on your knees a little, lining up your chest with his waist. His dick is close to you, growing evermore stiff as the seconds go by. Everything feels surreal. Here you are, seeing a pair of large perky breasts protruding from your body, as your boss’s penis presses against your soft skin. \n\n \n\n “Go on,” Thompson says. “Do it.” You look up to him, seeing the lust of you in his expression, and nod. \n\n \n\n Cupping your breasts with your hands, you squeeze them around his erect cock and work them up and down. The tip of his penis sticks out from the tops of your breasts, rising near to your mouth as you rock back and forward to stroke it.\n\n \n\n Thompson’s hand grasps your head and tilts you at the neck to face up. “Look at me,” he says, holding you to stare at him.\n\n \n\n Staring into his eyes, you see his face full of apparent desire. He leers, and you feel your top teeth press into your bottom lip whilst you meet his gaze.\n\n \n\n He moans and releases his grip slightly, pushing your face down again. You move your breasts faster, pushing them together ever-tighter to maintain traction and friction. The tip of his cock comes close to your lips. You see precum forming.\n\n \n\n “Fuck!” Thompson screams, giving you only a moment’s prep for his orgasm. Thick white streaks of semen fly up into the air, landing across the tops of your exposed breasts. \n\n \n\n You continue to vigorously massage until you hear him sigh in relaxation. Only then do you relax his dick from your breasts, your eyes falling upon the cum running from them down your body. \n\n \n\n Thompson takes a step back and leans against a table. “Good work,” he says, looking at you. “Maybe you have a future here, after all.”\n\n \n\n You look up at him, feeling the cold semen running down your skin, still kneeling on the floor with your breasts out. In spite of your situation, you feel obligated to politely smile. \n\n \n\n “You should get going,” he says, still taking deep breaths. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You shake your head and lean back away from the cock swaying in front of you. “No,” you mutter. “I don’t want this.”\n\n \n\n Thompson looks down from his position above you. “What?” he snaps.\n\n \n\n You take a breath and look up at him, trying to hold on to some sort of resilience. “I don’t want to.”\n\n \n\n Thompson bares his teeth, snarling. You feel your knees push into the worn office carpet, the air tense and hostile.\n\n \n\n “Get out,” he barks, as he turns away and adjusts his clothing. “We’ll discuss this tomorrow.”\n\n \n\n Sensing the opportunity of escape, you pull up the top of your outfit to cover your breasts again and stand back up, your shaking legs almost buckling in your heels. \n\n \n\n Thompson leans against a nearby table, watching you darkly. “Did you not hear me?” he says with anger bubbling in his voice.\n\n \n\n You nod, and, still shaking, totter over to the exit, not looking back at Thompson as you go.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Without much to help you clean-up and sensing Thompson’s frustrations rising again, you pull up the top of your outfit, feeling the cum on your waist staining against it as you do so. \n\n \n\n You stand up and adjust your top, wiping away the traces of cum that can still be seen around your shoulders. Unfortunately, there isn’t anywhere to wipe your fingers, now sticky and smelly.\n\n \n\n Wordlessly, you walk past Thompson towards the exit. He watches you as you go, smiling menacingly. You try to bury the feelings that you’re experiencing, but are sure that smile will linger in your memories for quite some time.\n\n \n\n Was it worth it? you hear a voice ask inside you. But instead you just walk, trying not to consider what you’ve just done. And what that means for you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \"I was wondering if you were working late,\" you reply.\n\n \n\n He looks at you, unconvinced. His eyes flick across you once more, finally seeing Annie's office keys in your hand. \"And where did you get those?\"\n\n \n\n \"Annie gave them to me,\" you say. \"She leant me her keys. If I wanted to work late with you.\"\n\n \n\n A sly grin spreads across Thompson's face. \"Annie gave you those keys?\" he says, slowly stepping towards you. \"That breaks office policy. I'll have to punish her. One evening.\"\n \n \n\n Quickly, you find yourself wedged between him and his office. He looks down at you, pushing his bloated body against yours, pinning you against the door.\n\n \n\n \"So you want to work late, do you Phillips?\" he says, with characteristic scorn. \"Earn a few brownie points with the boss? I can make your life very easy here. If you are willing to do what it takes.\"\n\n \n\n His eyes drift purposefully down to your chest, lingering as he looks down your top. He makes sure you see him do it, too.\n\n \n\n \"So Phillips, what will it be? Leave and forget all about this. Or get on your knees, and pull down that top?\"\n\n \n\n You stare up at him, realising he's giving you an exit out. The thought of getting some leniency at work gives you pause for consideration, however. *Are you really doing so badly at your job to consider that?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n “No,” you say quietly, but assuredly. \n\n \n\n Thompson’s eyes flash with surprise. “What?” \n\n \n\n “I’m not doing that,” you tell him flatly. “Not now. Not ever.”\n\n \n\n He smirks, but it’s laced with menace. “Thought you could just flirt your way to an easy time, right Phillips? Well I wasn't born yesterday. Pretty girls come up time and time again.\"\n\n \n\n Thompson eyes you darkly, but takes a step back. \"If you don't learn your place around here, Phillips, you're going to be out of a job. You might know more than the average secretary, but don't forget that you're here in part to look pretty and smile, just as much as a receptionist.\"\n\n \n\n Your eyes flicker to the door back to the lobby. Seeing you look, Thompson sighs.\n\n \n\n \"Get the hell out of here,\" he tells you. \"We'll pick this up later.\"\n\n \n \n Not wasting a moment, you gather up your things and walk past him. He doesn’t make any attempt to stop you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n Either through fear or curiosity, you find yourself obeying. Your knees go weak and you slide your back down the door, looking up at Thompson, now standing over you.\n\n \n\n “And the top,” he says. You nod and look down at your outfit. You unbutton your blouse and let it fall down your arms. You stare up at Thompson, aware of how much you're on display.\n\n \n\n \"Lose the bra,\" he tells you. You look down at the lacy bra holding your breasts firmly together. Then up it at him again. He nods, demanding.\n\n \n\n Faced with no alternative, you reach to your back and unclasp your underwear. With a slight tug and shimmer, your blouse and bra are cast aside.\n\n \n\n \"Nice tits, Phillips,\" Thompson tells you, as he stares down. His dark eyes meet yours and he grins.\n\n \n\n He unbuckles his belt and reaches into his pants, pulling out free a girthy and thick penis, dangling in front of your face. “You want this in-between your tits, don’t you? If you want to be in my good books, I want you to beg for it.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You shake your head and lean back away from the cock swaying in front of you. “No,” you mutter. “I don’t want this.”\n\n \n\n Thompson looks down from his position above you. “What?” he snaps.\n\n \n\n You take a breath and look up at him, trying to hold on to some sort of resilience. “I don’t want to.”\n\n \n\n Thompson bares his teeth, snarling. You feel the air on your bare breasts, causing your nipples to grow erect. \n\n \n\n “Get out,” he barks, as he turns away and adjusts his clothing. “We’ll discuss this tomorrow.”\n\n \n\n Sensing the opportunity of escape, you pull on your blouse to cover your breasts again and stand back up, your shaking legs almost buckling in your shoes.\n\n \n\n Thompson leans against a nearby table, watching you darkly. “Did you not hear me?” he says with anger bubbling in his voice.\n\n \n\n You nod, and, still shaking, totter over to the exit, not looking back at Thompson as you go.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You hear yourself mumble that you do.\n\n \n\n “Yes, what?” Thompson asks you.\n\n \n\n You understand his question and answer meekly. “Yes sir.”\n\n \n\n He smiles. “Good. Now, work those tits of yours.”\n\n \n\n Almost robotically, you arch up on your knees a little, lining up your chest with his waist. His dick is close to you, growing evermore stiff as the seconds go by. Everything feels surreal. Here you are, seeing a pair of large perky breasts protruding from your body, as your boss’s penis presses against your soft skin. \n\n \n\n “Go on,” Thompson says. “Do it.” You look up to him, seeing the lust of you in his expression, and nod. \n\n \n\n Cupping your breasts with your hands, you squeeze them around his erect cock and work them up and down. The tip of his penis sticks out from the tops of your breasts, rising near to your mouth as you rock back and forward to stroke it.\n\n \n\n Thompson’s hand grasps your head and tilts you at the neck to face up. “Look at me,” he says, holding you to stare at him.\n\n \n\n Staring into his eyes, you see his face full of apparent desire.

Unfortunately, there isn’t anywhere to wipe your fingers, now sticky and smelly.\n\n \n\n Wordlessly, you walk past Thompson towards the exit. He watches you as you go, smiling menacingly. You try to bury the feelings that you’re experiencing, but are sure that smile will linger in your memories for quite some time.\n\n \n\n Was it worth it? you hear a voice ask inside you. But instead you just walk, trying not to consider what you’ve just done. And what that means for you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n It was interesting, in a way. To see what Annie actually does. To sit in her chair, read her emails, type in her tone. To be someone else, for an hour or so.\n\n \n\n But it never really felt like you. Not exactly. And you've had enough of pretending to be other people, haven't you?\n\n \n\n You glance toward the front desk, then back at Thompson. \"I’d love to get back to the day job,\" you say.\n\n \n\n He nods, as if that’s the answer he expected. \"I’ll let Annie know,\" he replies. \"But if your performance dips again...\"\n\n \n\n His eyes narrow slightly. \"You know exactly where you’ll end up.\"\n\n \n\n He turns without waiting for a response, retreating into his office with the same heavy-footed finality he always carries.\n\n \n\n You’re free.\n\n \n\n For now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You hesitate. Loath to admit it, but... it’s been okay. Different. And a change is as good as a rest, right?\n\n \n\n There was something about those emails, too. In spite of the chaotic inbox and the weird keyboard, there was something in the way people reacted to your replies. It wasn’t what you signed up for, but it was... kind of fun?\n\n \n\n You glance at Thompson. \"I don’t mind still pitching in at lunchtimes,\" you say. \"Helping out around here.\"\n\n \n\n \n Thompson doesn’t look surprised. \"I thought you’d say that,\" he says, arms crossing again.\n\n \n\n You frown.\n\n \n\n \"Look,\" he says, voice firm but patronising, \"I know women might do stressful jobs in the city. But here? Things are more cut and dry. Simple work. Simple pace. Simple life. That’s the appeal.”\n\n \n\n “And I’m not surprised that, after a taste of a job like that, you’ve started to see the benefits.\"\n\n \n\n He tilts his head, watching you.\n\n \n\n \"Feels more relaxed, doesn’t it? More like a woman?\"\n\n \n\n You say nothing.\n\n \n\n He waits a beat, then moves on without further comment.\n\n \n\n \"I’ll let Annie know you’ll be covering her lunch breaks. Just make sure the customers are happy.\"\n\n \n\n His tone hardens again as he walks off. \"I don’t want to be having another performance conversation.\"\n \n Thompson blinks. Caught off guard. \"You want to willingly do...\" he gestures vaguely toward reception, \"...women’s work?\"\n\n \n\n He sighs, genuinely baffled. The sharpness in his voice fades. He lowers it, not quite gentle, but trying to be... honest?\n\n \n\n \"Let me give you some advice,\" he says. \"I know back in the city, men are hairdressers and women are bricklayers. Everyone’s got fluid titles and modern ideas.\"\n\n \n\n He leans slightly closer, his voice dropping even further. \"But here in Charlton? It’s still pink jobs and blue jobs. That’s the way it is. There’s work for the boys, and tasks for the ladies.\"\n\n \n\n He eyes you, trying to measure something.\n\n \n\n \"If you want to get anywhere in this town, you’re going to have to accept that.\"\n\n \n\n You don’t reply.\n\n \n\n He exhales. “Fine. I’ll let Annie know you’re still covering her lunch breaks. Just make sure the customers are happy.\"\n\n \n\n There’s a pause as he walks off. Then, he looks back over his shoulder. \n\n \n\n \"I could make it more permanent, if your performance drops again.\" A faint smirk tugs at the corner of his mouth. \"Though I’m not sure that would be a punishment for you.\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You don’t speak. You just move.\n\n \n\n Slow, mechanical, deliberate. Towards the desk. Eyes lowered. Hands brushing polished wood. You stop in front of it, feeling the weight of his gaze behind you. Then, wordlessly, you bend over.\n\n \n\n You hear him step closer. Feel his presence at your back. The quiet rasp of his belt. “Hands behind your back,” he commands.\n\n \n\n You do as he says, resting your hands on your blouse, staring forward at the back of the office, chin resting on the wood desk.\n\n \n\n A chink of a buckle, then you feel leather wrapping around your wrists. Pulling them tight together. A clip as his belt closes shut around your hands. “Now you’ll see what good secretaries get for following orders,” Thompson says from behind you.\n\n \n\n You feel your skirt behind pulled up your legs, bunching up around your rear. Then your underwear is pulled down, resting around your knees. Cool air touches your exposed buttocks. You instinctively flinch and are reminded of the belt bound around your wrists. Even if you wanted to stop this, you know there is no way out.\n\n \n\n A tingle, as fingers massage your bum. Then move in-between your crack. And then you gasp as Thompson’s digits gingerly brush over your genitalia.\n\n \n\n A murmur escapes your mouth. Like electricity, sensations shoot through your body. Thompson chuckles behind you as his hands play with your lips. “Like that, huh?”\n\n \n\n You stare at the dark grain of the desk, the flickering edge of the typewriter beside you still pulsing with faint yellow light. The keys hum like still they’re waiting to be touched. But, as you begin to pant, you know that typing isn’t what Thompson had in mind this afternoon.\n\n \n\n Your feel your pussy moisten. Lubrication starts to flow. You arch at his touch, reminded again of your restricted movements. Even your panties seem like shackles around your legs. It takes everything not to relax your ankles and slip in your heels. The sensations threaten to overwhelm you.\n\n \n\n Then one of Thompson’s fingers slips inside you. Carefully. Almost sensitively. And you hear yourself moan.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You writhe as another finger moves inside your womb, playing inside like a worm trying to find a sweet spot to make you buckle.\n\n \n\n The belt begins to dig in to your skin as you move in response to Thompson. Each thrust makes you jolt, your body aching to do something - anything - but bent over the desk, hands restrained behind you, panties clasped around your knees, you just can’t.\n\n \n\n Thompson’s fingers become faster. Rougher. Sending you towards the edge of ecstasy. Your moans become loud. Groans of pleasure without the sight of the cause, constrained to just be played with by your boss.\n\n \n\n Your breasts rub against the desk through your movements, feeling raw as your body shakes from Thompson’s actions. Even through your bra, you feel your nipples tingle against the dark wood.\n\n \n\n And just as you start to feel yourself build to a climax, there’s a knock.\n\n \n\n Three short raps.\n\n \n\n You freeze. Thompson doesn’t.\n\n \n\n “Occupied,” he calls, like this is just another meeting.\n\n \n\n You recognise the voice behind the door. Soft. Controlled. “Of course. I’ll wait.”\n\n \n\n Annie.\n\n \n\n She heard. She knows.\n\n \n\n And Thompson? He doesn’t pause, doesn’t shift. He continues to finger you with rigor and frenzy. “She’s been very promising, Annie,” he calls, voice smooth. “Knows exactly what the job requires.”\n\n \n\n Then, you feel him lean over your body, his mouth close to your ear. “You’ll go far here, Phillips. I knew you understood.”\n\n \n\n It’s enough to finish you off. You push your top lip into your bottom teeth, trying keep the cry of an orgasm contained. You hear the sound of your half-successful attempt echo in the room.\n\n \n\n The sensation of Thompson’s fingers moving cease. Silence comes to the office, only broken by your quiet panting.\n\n \n\n A moment later, Thompson’s fingers pull out from within you and you finally feel his belt being undone from around your wrists.\n\n \n\n “Good,” you hear him whisper. “Now. Make yourself presentable.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Thompson moves back around the desk, taking his seat again, looking you dead in the eye with a satisfied smile. You push yourself up from the desk, and with a degree of bashfulness, pull your underwear back up, straighten your skirt down and pull at your ruffled blouse. Almost without thinking, you stand up as if presenting yourself back to him.\n\n \n\n His smile widens, satisfaction apparent. “Back to work now. No slacking.”\n\n \n\n You can only nod, feeling fragile on your heels. Wordlessly, you turn and open the door, stepping back into the office.\n\n \n\n Straight into the stare of Annie.\n\n \n\n She looks up from her desk as you close Thompson’s door. But her eyes - sharp, guarded - give you a look fresh with concern. Heavy, understanding. Not judgement. Not pity.\n\n \n\n *Recognition.*\n\n \n\n You look away from her and walk back to reception. You sit, trying to regain some control over your body and the lingering sensations. The inbox is still open. The phones are calm. You answer three emails in a row before you realise your hands haven’t stopped trembling. But your responses are flawless. Polite. Efficient.\n\n \n\n You’re doing well, you think.\n\n \n\n Doing exactly what he wants.\n\n \n\n You can’t help but think where this will now lead.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You hesitate. Your body wants to move. To bend. To obey. There’s a voice in your head - sweet, soft, coaxing - telling you this is what a good secretary does. That it's easier this way. That it's expected.\n\n \n\n But you fight it.\n\n \n\n You lift your chin. Keep your voice steady. Soft. Polite. “No. I don’t think that would be appropriate.”\n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t move. But his jaw twitches. His lips pull into a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. It’s not a grin. It’s a warning. A rottweiler baring its teeth. “Not appropriate?\" he repeats, voice low. “After all the looks? The comments? After stringing things along?”\n\n \n\n You open your mouth, but no words come out. You instead glance to the floor.\n\n \n\n Thompson bounds around his desk and for a moment, you feel your body tense up. But he moves past you, tearing the office door wide open, the frame rattling as he does so. “Get out,” Thompson growls.\n\n \n\n You glance out through the door to see Annie sitting at her new desk, looking up in fear. The rest of the office has drawn silent. Even Dan is staring, his trademark smirk absent from his face.\n\n \n\n “Annie!” Thompson barks, loud enough to make the walls flinch. “Call the school. Let them know I anticipate a vacancy on the front desk.”\n\n \n\n He says it with perfect calm. Still smiling. Still watching you. The message is clear. Thompson walks back towards his desk, leaving you standing there.\n\n \n\n \n \n ”And get in here,” he murmurs, still talking to Annie. Sitting down at his desk, he gives you a dark smile. “At least she understands the demands of dictation.”\n\n \n\n You pause in the doorway. Annie meets your gaze as she rises from her desk, her expression unreadable. Then she walks past you and into the office, pulling the door shut behind her.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You pause, taking one last look at the desk in front of you. The call logs. The inbox. The familiar clack of the monitor. All of it is so different from what you used to do. And yet, somehow… you made it work. But it never really felt like you. Not completely.\n\n \n\n You nod. “I’d love to get back to the day job.”\n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t smile. Just grunts. “I’ll let Annie know she's back on front-desk. But you know the deal.” He turns slightly, eyes narrowed. “If performance drops again… you know exactly where you’ll end up.”\n\n \n\n And then he’s gone. The door shuts behind him, leaving you at the desk one last time.\n\n \n\n You’re free.\n\n \n\n For now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You hesitate. Then glance at the inbox. It’s strange. You’ve settled into this role. In ways you didn’t expect. Answering phones. Booking calls. Smoothing over customers. Even the emails. There was a strange satisfaction in seeing people happy. Responding warmly. Gratefully.\n\n \n\n And truth be told… there’s something about the routine. The simplicity. The way people see you here.\n\n \n\n \"I don’t mind staying on reception,\" you say.\n\n \n\n \n Thompson doesn’t even look surprised. “Thought you’d say that.”\n\n \n\n You frown.\n\n \n\n He shrugs. “City women burn themselves out chasing jobs that never love them back. Here? Things are simpler. Work’s steady. Life’s manageable.”\n\n \n\n He watches you carefully. Voice almost gentle. Almost. “And I’m not shocked you’ve started to see the appeal. Feels more relaxed, doesn’t it? More like what a woman should be doing?”\n\n \n\n You say nothing.\n\n \n\n He turns to leave. “I’ll let Annie know. We’ll put in the offer to Theodore for him to take up your old role. It’s a pain getting his updates in the post every morning, but he’s the only one in town who understands how it works. Except you, of course, but you’d rather be sweet-talking suppliers and getting me coffees than use that brain of yours, right, sweetheart?”\n\n \n\n He stops at the door. Glances back. Tone sharpening again.\n\n \n\n “Treat this as a reward for being such a good girl. But don’t take advantage of my gratitude. I don’t want to be having a performance conversation with you, again.”\n\n \n Thompson blinks. Taken aback. “You want to stay on reception?”\n\n \n\n He squints, like you just asked him to wear a skirt to Sunday service.\n\n \n\n “I just… enjoy it,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n He steps closer. Drops his voice. “You still don’t get it, do you. This isn’t a job for men, Phillips. This is something young girls do until they bag a man and settle down. You might be used to doing things differently in the city, but here in Charlton - we’re traditional. Pink jobs. Blue jobs. And being a secretary? This is a pink job, Phillips.”\n\n \n\n Thompson looks around, almost as if he’s watching for anyone listening. Then leans in, almost whispering. “You don’t want people thinking you’re… a bit strange… do you?”\n\n \n\n You stay silent.\n\n \n\n He straightens. “Fine. Dig your own grave. I’ll let Annie know. She’ll get Theodore working from that caravan of his. Mark my words, Phillips. This makes my life more complicated. I’m moving mountains to accommodate you, here. So if your performance drops again, I’ll be upset. Maybe wondering if you deserve a job here, at all.”\n\n \n\n And he walks off, leaving the words to simmer.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You loiter near the front desk, pretending to check the calendar, fingers twitching with nerves. You’ve been standing here long enough to look suspicious, but you don’t know what else to do.\n\n \n\n Then the door to the back office swings open. Thompson steps out, reading something on a clipboard, his brow furrowed in concentration. He almost walks straight past you, but stops. His eyes narrow. “You again?\"\n\n \n\n He doesn’t say it like a question. More like an accusation.\n\n \n\n “Mr. Thompson,\" you begin. \"I know I messed up. I should have put in more effort. I know that now. But I've given it a lot of thought. I know I can do better. Have a better attitude.”\n\n \n\n You shift on your feet, bracing yourself for a tirade of abuse. But instead, there is silence. You look back at him. Watching him judge you.\n\n \n\n “Save the pitch,\" he says quietly. \"People have been saying things about you, Phillips. You've got friends, I'll give you that.\"\n\n \n\n He sighs. Loudly. A long-suffering exhale of someone who desperately wants to say no.\n\n \n\n “I’ve also heard Theodore’s been making a pig’s ear of the calendar again,” he mutters. “So congratulations. You’ve somehow annoyed me less than him this week.”\n\n \n\n He finally looks you in the eye. “One. Last. Chance, Phillips. You show up. You do the job. No whining. No disappearing. And if I get even one more complaint, no amount of pity from Gordon or puppy eyes from Annie is going to save you. Got it?”\n\n \n\n You nod. Quickly. Quietly.\n\n \n\n “Good,” he grunts. “Now get out of my sight before someone thinks I’m being generous.”\n\n \n\n He disappears back into the office. The door swings shut behind him.\n\n \n\n And just like that, you’re hired again.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n **Thompson's Handyman Repairs - Thompson's Office**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Office_Thompson.png]\n\n \nA cluttered and cramped office, lined with filing cabinets. An imposing desk is the centerpiece, covered in files and paperwork.\n\n \n \n You enter the office, the dark oak wood lit by office lamps and the blinds pulled down. Thompson sits behind his desk, straining as he reviews papers. “Annie,” he says. “Take a seat.”\n\n \n\n You step forward towards his desk and spot an object in front of the seat immediately. Sitting on the desk beside a pile of thick envelopes is a black, boxy typewriter - matte casing, faint gold engraving curling around the edges, and yellowed keys. Keys that fizzle with magic. \n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t notice your hesitation. More concerningly, he's not even paying attention to you. He's still reading the paperwork in front of him. \"I know you didn't want to type anymore, Annie. But I really need some correspondence sent out,\" he mutters whilst looking down. \"About -\"\n\n \n\n He abruptly stops talking as he slams a fist down on to the table. \"Goddamn it!\"\n\n \n\n A moment of silent tension fills the room. You freeze, feeling adrenaline rushing through your body.\n\n \n \n \n \n \"Goddamn Theodore!\" Thompson begins. \"Look at this report! The supplier address is in the customer address, and the customer address is in the supplier address. Is it any wonder that the Hudson's didn't receive their boiler yet!\"\n\n \n\n You eye the older man carefully. His face is red with frustration. You can sense he's ready to explode still. But this might be an opportunity to persuade him that he made a mistake in firing you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [Saucy Secretary] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \"Goddamn Phillips!\" Thompson begins. \"Look at this report! The supplier address is in the customer address, and the customer address is in the supplier address. Is it any wonder that the Hudson's didn't receive their boiler yet! Where the hell is that lazy shit, Annie? Why aren't they here?\"\n\n \n\n You eye the older man carefully. His face is red with frustration. You can sense he's ready to explode still. But you need to do something, otherwise Thompson is going to really be mad at you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [Saucy Secretary] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n\n You don’t even think. The moment you feel the tension rising, something fluttery and soft bubbles up behind your lips.\n\n \n\n “Oh, Mr Thompson,” you coo gently, easing into the chair like you’ve done this a hundred times. “There is a solution, you know. If Theodore’s not working out…” You pause, letting the silence bloom. “Why not bring back?”\n\n \n\n Thompson’s face reddens again. “I should give that lazy layabout a second chance?”\n\n \n\n You cross your legs slowly, making sure the exposed thigh catches the lamplight. Your voice dips lower, warmer. “He’s not lazy. Just… a little lost without your direction. I think he’d thrive under your leadership. We all do.”\n\n \n\n Thompson’s eyes flick down, then snap back to your face. A small smile forms. \"You thrive underneath me, do you, Annie?\"\n\n \n\n You want to scream, but before you can react your mouth forms words like it has a mind of its own. \"I've learned a lot from you being on top, Mr. Thompson.\"\n\n \n\n Your own internal monologue cries out, but you stay silent as the older man takes you in with his eyes. \"You think people deserve a second chance, do you, Annie?\"\n \n\n You lean forward just a little, enough to let your blouse tighten at the chest. “I think,” you murmur. “If you gave someone a second chance, they’d make sure not to waste it.”\n\n \n\n Thompson grins and leans back into his chair, his eyes now running up and down your body. \"Stand up.\"\n\n \n\n Your eyes narrow. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n Brows rise. \"You heard me.\"\n\n \n\n Narrowing your eyes, you nevertheless do as he says. Feeling on display as you stand in front of his desk, as he watches you from his leather chair.\n\n \n\n Thompson stands and slowly walks around to your side. You glance at him from the corner of your eye. He looks you up and down, his tongue running across his lips.\n\n \n\n \"Here's the deal,\" he murmurs. \"I'll consider hiring that good-for-nothing back, and you remember your place. None of this feminist crap. No threats about what you know. Lunchtime visits to Charlton Hotel. Late nights working overtime. Just how it was. Are we clear?\"\n\n \n\n Your eyes widen. You remember what Annie said as you left her apartment. *\"Don't let anyone take advantage of you. I mean it.\"*\n\n \n\n Thompson watches you, waiting. If you make this choice, you know what's in-store for Annie next time she comes into work.\n\n \n\n Are you going to turn down this chance though of getting your job back?\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You steel yourself. You don’t want to do this. But you’ve seen how Annie moves in these situations. You’ve seen what gets results. And right now, you need results.\n\n \n\n Crossing your legs slowly as you sit, you let Thompson eye your thigh. “Mr Thompson,” you say, voice sugar-sweet. “If Theodore isn’t working out, maybe there’s still time to fix your mistake.”\n\n \n\n Thompson barely glances directly at you. “Mistake?”\n\n \n\n You lean forward just enough for your blouse to tighten. “Letting go,” you murmur. “He was reliable. Loyal. And he always wanted to please you.”\n\n \n\n That makes him look. His eyes flick to your chest, then linger on your lips. “Is that so?”\n\n \n\n You nod slowly, holding eye contact. “Yes sir. I mean, we all do.\"\n\n \n\n Thompson exhales, long and slow, the corner of his mouth twitching. “I thought you found pleasing me beneath you, Annie?”\n\n \n\n You smile politely, heartbeat pounding. “I don't know about that, sir. But I know would be very eager to show his appreciation. If he got a second chance.”\n\n \n \n Thompson leans back in his chair, watching you in silence. \"And how eager would you be, Annie? To show your appreciation.\"\n\n \n\n You gulp. \"I would be grateful, sir.\"\n\n \n\n Thompson's eyes drift across you, as you watch him mull over thoughts in his head. \"Stand up,\" he barks after a moment.\n\n \n\n Your eyes narrow. \"What?\"\n\n \n\n Brows rise. \"You heard me.\"\n\n \n\n Narrowing your eyes, you nevertheless do as he says. Feeling on display as you stand in front of his desk, as he watches you from his leather chair.\n\n \n\n Thompson stands and slowly walks around to your side. You glance at him from the corner of your eye. He looks you up and down, his tongue running across his lips.\n\n \n\n \"Here's the deal,\" he murmurs. \"I'll consider hiring that good-for-nothing back, and you remember your place. None of this feminist crap. No threats about what you know. Lunchtime visits to Charlton Hotel. Late nights working overtime. Just how it was. Are we clear?\"\n\n \n\n Your eyes widen. You remember what Annie said as you left her apartment. *\"Don't let anyone take advantage of you. I mean it.\"*\n\n \n\n Thompson watches you, waiting. If you make this choice, you know what's in-store for Annie next time she comes into work.\n\n \n\n Are you going to turn down this chance though of getting your job back?\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You force a smile and cross your legs slowly as you sit, hoping to shift the mood. “Mr Thompson,” you say lightly, letting a teasing lilt touch your voice. “Maybe you were a little hasty. made mistakes, sure, but… I think he’s learned his lesson. And he’d be so grateful for another chance. Especially under your guidance.”\n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t look up from the file in front of him. “Is that right.”\n\n \n\n You lean forward slightly, fingers playing with the hem of your skirt. “He always said you had a strong… presence. The kind that brings out the best in people.”\n\n \n\n That just about gets his attention. He lifts his head just enough to look at you over the top of the paper stack.\n\n \n\n “Do you think that game is going to work on me?”\n\n \n\n You freeze. The air goes still. His face is barely containing the rage.\n\n \n\n You try to recover. “I didn’t mean -”\n\n \n\n “I know what you meant,” he snaps. “And I don’t appreciate it. I don’t tolerate incompetence, and I sure as hell don’t change my mind because of batting lashes and crossed legs. You cancelled our agreement. That won't work anymore.”\n\n \n\n You feel your face flush. Your hands curl tightly in your lap.\n\n \n\n Thompson sighs and waves a hand dismissively. “I’ve got work to do. You’re dismissed, Annie.”\n\n \n\n You stand quietly. The typewriter beside you buzzes faintly, as if disappointed it won’t be fed. You don’t look at it.\n\n \n\n As you reach for the door, you glance back, Thompson is watching you go. Snarling.\n\n \n\n You step out into the hallway, heart sinking. And from within the office, you hear something shattering against a wall.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n You adjust your posture, keeping your voice steady and professional. “Mr Thompson,” you say carefully, “maybe it’s time to bring back.”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t look up. “After the mess they left?”\n\n \n\n You lean forward slightly, choosing your words. “Sir, with respect… Theodore has made three serious errors in two weeks. Shipping delays, customer complaints, supplier mix-ups.”\n\n \n\n That gets his attention. Thompson frowns, still pretending to read.\n\n \n\n “ handled the same workload without any major issues. They weren’t perfect, but they were reliable. You didn’t have to clean up after them. The phones were quieter. Fewer mistakes. Fewer problems on your desk.”\n\n \n\n Thompson sets the papers down. His expression is sour, but listening.\n\n \n\n “And let’s be honest,” you add, “there’s not exactly a long line of talent outside the door. If the goal is to keep customers happy and things running smooth, then is the best option. Business-wise.”\n\n \n\n A long pause. Then Thompson grunts. “Hmph. So now I’m getting performance reviews from my receptionist.”\n\n \n\n You hold his gaze. “No, sir. You’re getting a solution.”\n \n\n He studies you. Not with desire this time, but calculation. After a moment, he pulls a file from the side of the desk and slaps it down.\n\n \n\n “Think you’ve got a business brain now? Then prove it. These customers need replies. It’s the best option. Business-wise.”\n \n\n You blink. “And ?”\n\n \n\n He gestures toward the black typewriter. Its matte casing glows faintly, golden edges catching the desk lamp. “You want back? Then show me this business won't suffer when he screws up and we have to go manual again.\"\n\n \n\n You glance toward the door. Then at the machine.\n \n\n Finally, you nod. “Of course.”\n \n\n The moment your fingers brush the keys, the magic stirs. It’s subtle. A warm pull at first, then a slow coiling in your spine. Posture adjusts. Shoulders square. Ankles cross. The obedient rhythm of work takes hold.\n\n \n\n Thompson watches in silence.\n \n\n “Still got it,” he murmurs, almost to himself.\n \n\n You keep typing. And typing. The room fades to the soft clack of keys and the heavy pulse of submission.\n \n\n You might have a shot of getting your old job back. But something else is slipping away.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n You clear your throat gently, keeping your tone measured. “Mr Thompson,” you begin, “maybe it’s worth considering… bringing back.”\n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t look up. “That so?”\n\n \n\n You press on, trying to stay calm. “Theodore’s been making a lot of errors. Customer complaints, supplier confusion --”\n\n \n\n Thompson slams his pen down with a sharp clack. “And what exactly makes you think I want your opinion on staffing?”\n\n \n\n You hesitate. “I just thought… from a business perspective, maybe it would make sense. had fewer issues.”\n\n \n\n “ made his own bed,” Thompson snaps. “I’ve got enough on my plate without someone second-guessing my hiring decisions. Especially not someone who spends their days flirting on the phone with customers.”\n\n \n\n You sit a little straighter, trying to salvage it. “It’s not about second-guessing -”\n\n \n\n He waves a hand sharply. “Enough. I don’t need a lecture from my receptionist.”\n\n \n\n The room goes quiet. Thompson flips open another file and doesn’t look at you. “I’ve got real work to do. You're dismissed, Annie.”\n\n \n\n You stand slowly, heart sinking. As you turn to leave, the typewriter beside you gives a small electric fizz, as if disappointed it won’t be fed.\n\n \n\n You don’t look back. And this time, there’s no offer. No second chance. Just the faint sound of the blinds rustling in the draft as the door clicks shut behind you.\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n You take a deep breath, then nod. \"Alright.\"\n\n \n\n Thompson catches your look. \"Alright what?\"\n\n \n\n You swallow. \"Alright, sir.\"\n\n \n\n \"Good girl,\" he murmurs. \"You remember quick.\" He runs a finger down your arm and you feel the hair standing on end. \"I'm looking forward to our lunchtime meetings resuming. But how about a little taste right now?\"\n\n \n\n His hand flashes out and roughly cups your breast through your blouse. You gasp and flinch, taking every ounce of willpower not to recoil. You feel his coarse hands pawing at the edge of your bra underneath your clothes, thumb jamming underneath to rub your nipple.\n\n \n\n \"I've missed these titties,\" he whispers to you. \"So pert and juicy.\"\n\n \n\n You gasp at his touch, feeling your body respond to his touch. You clamp your teeth shut. He chuckles, massaging your tit through the fabric.\n\n \n\n \"Look at my desk, Annie,\" he continues whispering. \"It's a shame I've got this mess to clean up. Any other time, you'd be bent over it right now. Skirt hoisted up, panties around your legs, feeling my cock sliding in and out of your fuckhole. What do you say to that?\"\n\n \n\n You know exactly what he wants you to say. What he expects you to say. \"Yes.\"\n\n \n\n \"Yes, what?\"\n\n \n\n \"Yes... sir.\"\n\n \n\n He pulls his thumb away from you and slaps your arse. \"There's my girl,\" he says, walking back around his desk and dropping into his leather chair. You stand motionless, looking down at the floor.\n\n \n\n \"I'll consider bringing Phillips back in,\" he tells you. \"And I'll see you later. Dismissed.\"\n\n \n\n You turn quickly and put your hand on the doorknob, feeling your hand tremble as you open the door. You feel the wrinkle in your blouse, a reminder of the deal you just made. You try not to think about what this means for Annie. And how she'll react.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You feel your breath catch, heart hammering. Every part of you screams to keep quiet. To nod. To play along.\n\n \n\n But Annie’s voice cuts through. *Don’t let anyone take advantage of you. I mean it.*\n\n \n\n You steady yourself. Then lift your chin.\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry, Mr Thompson,” you say, voice low but firm. “That’s not the kind of job I’m asking for.”\n\n \n\n A long silence follows. Thompson’s expression hardens like wet cement. Whatever glint of amusement he had vanishes instantly.\n\n \n\n He snorts through his nose. “Right. One of those days, is it?”\n\n \n\n He turns from you, already heading back to his chair. “Don’t come crawling later. The door’s closed. Permanently.”\n\n \n\n You don’t flinch. You don’t say anything. You just turn and walk out.\n\n \n\n The door clicks shut behind you. You’re not getting your job back today.\n\n \n\n But at least you've avoided signing Annie up for a fate worse than what she's already been through.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n You sit quietly in the chair, hands folded in your lap. The weight of the moment presses down, but you say nothing.\n\n \n\n Across the desk, Thompson mutters to himself as he reads the paperwork. “Theodore… idiot can’t tell the difference between a purchase order and a packing slip.”\n\n \n\n You keep your eyes forward, your lips shut. He hasn’t mentioned yet, but the tension in the room makes your heart pound.\n\n \n\n Finally, Thompson sighs loudly and drops the folder. “Maybe I was too hasty letting that kid go,” he grumbles, mostly to himself.\n\n \n\n Your breath catches.\n\n \n\n He glances at you now, eyes tired. “You still type, don’t you?”\n\n \n\n You nod, slowly. Carefully.\n\n \n\n “Then prove it,” he says, pushing a thick stack of envelopes and scribbled notes toward the matte black typewriter beside you.\n\n \n\n You hesitate, looking at the magic crackling on the keys. Your fingers settle on them. They fizzle faintly at your touch, like they’ve been waiting. The hum of magic curls up your arms, not forceful, just insistent. Familiar. Obedient.\n\n \n\n And then you begin.\n\n \n\n Click. Clack. Tap. The sound of the keys fills the office like rain on a tin roof. Thompson doesn’t speak. He just watches.\n\n \n\n The longer you type, the easier it gets. Your spine straightens. Your knees cross. Your lips curve into something polite and pleasant. It’s not quite a smile, but it’s close.\n\n \n\n Thompson finally stands, mutters something about reviewing invoices, and leaves the room. But you don’t stop typing.\n\n \n\n You keep going, letter by letter. Line by line. When Thompson returns, you actually smile when he compliments your work.\n\n \n\n As you get up to leave, you are sure you had a chance to rectify something. Something to do with getting your job back. But the memory is fleeting. Almost like a dream.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n You don’t even think. The moment you feel the tension rising, something fluttery and soft bubbles up behind your lips.\n\n \n\n “Oh, Mr Thompson,” you coo gently, easing into the chair like you’ve done this a hundred times. “I’m sure didn’t mean to cause any trouble. They're probably just… overwhelmed. It’s been such a hectic week.”\n\n \n\n You cross your legs, making sure your exposed thigh is facing Thompson. You tilt your head ever so slightly, letting a note of concern dance on your voice. “They try really hard. Honestly. Just want to make you proud. We all do.”\n\n \n\n Thompson’s jaw twitches. He looks at you. Then down to your legs. Then back again. The anger is still there, but now it’s folding into something else. His brow furrows, puzzled, then flattens.\n\n \n\n “Hmph,” he grunts. “Proud, huh? Could have fooled me. Sloppier every week.”\n\n \n\n You give a small, sympathetic smile. “Maybe they just need… some firm direction,\" you say. \"Like you do with me.”\n \n\n That lands. Thompson sits back, looking at you. \"I thought you wanted me to loosen your leash, Annie?\"\n\n \n\n You gulp, seeing a slight smirk appear on the man's face. \"I can take direction,\" you mumble.\n\n \n\n \"Then prove it,\" he says slowly, before pushing a stack of notes forward towards you. “Let’s see if you can still follow instructions.”\n\n \n\n You hesitate, but your hands are already moving toward the keys. The moment your fingers brush them, you feel a faint pulse. Not from the machine, but from something deeper. Something in you shifts.\n\n \n\n The keys are warm. Eager. The magic crackles at your touch. You didn’t mean to smile, but somehow, you are.\n\n \n\n As the typewriter clacks, you feel yourself adjusting. Submitting. It’s easier than arguing. Easier than disappointing him again.\n\n \n\n You glance at Thompson. He’s watching you now, studying your response. You find yourself smiling politely. Almost meekly.\n\n \n\n For the next hour there's no mention of booking systems or bugs. Key after key, line after line, you type. Before you know it, the afternoon has slipped away.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n You let your lips part into a soft smile. Just enough to seem sincere. Just enough to be noticed.\n\n \n\n “Mr Thompson,” you say gently, voice lilting. “I’m sure it was just a small mix-up. I know can be a bit scatterbrained, but… they mean well.”\n\n \n\n Thompson grunts, flipping another page. “Means well? So do golden retrievers. Doesn’t mean I’d let one loose on my booking system.”\n\n \n\n You force yourself to giggle lightly and cross your legs, drawing his eyeline to your exposed thigh. \"Golden retrievers have their place,\" you say. \"They're loyal.\"\n\n \n\n \"I didn't take you for a golden retriever girl,\" Thompson murmurs. \"Thought you'd go for something more manly. Like a pitbull.\"\n\n \n\n His eyes wander your body, then up to you. A crooked smile forms, waiting.\n\n \n\n You tilt your head. “I like all sorts of dogs, sir.”\n\n \n\n He lets out a snort. \"I know you do.\" He grins, now letting it turn lecherous. \"Thing about dogs, Annie. Hard to train. Obedience is a rare quality these days. Once they stop obeying, you either retrain them, or you put them down.”\n\n \n\n He reaches forward slowly and slides the notes across to you.\n\n \n\n You gulp, looking between the papers, Thompson and the typewriter. “Of course, sir,\" you say sweetly. “I'm always happy to be helpful.”\n\n \n\n The moment your fingers touch the keys, you feel it. The warm tingle of magic as the machine hums beneath your hands. It wants you to type. To perform.\n\n \n\n And you do. Line by line, letter by letter. Even as your stomach knots.\n\n \n\n You feel Thompson’s eyes on you as you work. You feel your posture shift. Straighter. Neater. More... proper. Your smile stays fixed.\n\n \n\n For the next hour there's no mention of booking systems or bugs. Key after key, line after line, you type. Dropping into a gentle rhythm of the mind-numbing typing, as magic seeps into your fingertips.\n\n \n\n You are suddenly aware of Thompson behind you, reviewing your work. You glance to the clock and see the afternoon has slipped away.\n\n \n\n \"Good girl,\" he says. And he pats your head gently.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n You try to smile, keeping your voice light. “Mr Thompson, I’m sure it was just a little mix-up. has a lot on his plate lately, and, well… maybe they just need a little more support.”\n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t look up. “Support? Phillips has got two hands, like the rest of us.\"\n\n \n\n You laugh, but it's awkward and too high-pitched. “I just mean… I’m sure they didn’t mean any harm. You’re so good at keeping everything running smoothly. Maybe they just need someone like you to set them straight.”\n\n \n\n Thompson turns the page in his hand with slow, deliberate disdain. “Set them straight? Annie, if I wanted praise, I’d talk to my mirror.”\n\n \n\n You shift in the chair, heat creeping up your neck. “I just thought -”\n\n \n\n “That’s your first mistake,” he snaps. He finally looks up, irritation heavy in his gaze. “I don’t pay you to think. I need someone who can follow basic instructions. But, clearly, you're not yet prepared to accept this.”\n\n \n\n He pulls off the top paper and begins reading again. \"Make yourself useful. Go get on with something. That's not in here.\"\n\n \n\n Your hands tremble as you stand up. Thompson doesn't look at you. As you leave, you glance down at the typewriter. The magic embers on each of the keys straining towards you.\n\n \n\n As your hand hits the door, you realise you’ve narrowly avoided something worse. But Thompson’s anger isn’t gone. It’s just waiting for you tomorrow.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n You straighten your back in the chair and meet Thompson’s gaze. Calm. Professional.\n\n \n\n “With respect, sir,” you say evenly, “ isn’t here to defend themself. I don’t think you’re being fair.”\n\n \n\n That gets his attention. Thompson lowers the paper slowly, one eyebrow raised.\n\n \n\n “You’ve seen the state of the systems,” you continue. “They’re out of date. Duct-taped together. We’re running a modern workload on tech that’s two decades old. Anyone’s going to slip up eventually.”\n\n \n\n He watches you, eyes narrowing almost to slits.\n\n \n\n “And it’s not like they're slacking,” you quickly add. “You’ve had them covering inventory, supplier contacts, and customer calendars. Something was bound to break.”\n\n \n\n Thompson drums his fingers on the desk, staring at you. You can sense the anger rising up. “So what, we just accept incompetence?”\n\n \n\n “No, sir. But you give more time. There's no one else in town that can do the job.”\n\n \n\n A long pause. Then Thompson exhales sharply through his nose. “Alright, Annie. You want me to give them a break? Then it’s time you remembered your old duties.\"\n\n \n\n Fear bolts through you. Thompson reaches out... and pushes a stack of notes forward towards you. “Let’s see if you remember how to type.”\n\n \n\n You gulp, looking between the papers, Thompson and the typewriter. “Of course, sir,\" you say sweetly.\n\n \n\n The moment your fingers touch the keys, you feel it. The warm tingle of magic as the machine hums beneath your hands. It wants you to type. To perform. You pause for a heartbeat, but something in your spine straightens before you can resist.\n\n \n\n You begin to type. Line by line, letter by letter. Even as your stomach knots.\n\n \n\n You feel Thompson’s eyes on you as you work. You feel your posture shift. Straighter. Neater. More... proper. Your smile stays fixed.\n\n \n\n For the next hour there's no mention of booking systems or bugs. Key after key, line after line, you type. Dropping into a gentle rhythm of the mind-numbing typing, as magic seeps into your fingertips.\n\n \n\n You are suddenly aware of Thompson behind you, reviewing your work. You glance to the clock and see the afternoon has slipped away.\n\n \n\n \"Glad to see things are going back to normal around here,\" he says. \"You're dismissed.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n You sit up straighter, choosing your words carefully. “Sir, with respect, has been juggling a lot lately. They're not trying to sabotage anything. Just overwhelmed.”\n\n \n\n Thompson’s eyes don’t move from the paper in front of him. “Overwhelmed?” he repeats, voice flat. “By what? Reading the morning paper whilst bunking off work?”\n\n \n\n You ignore the sting. “The systems are outdated. The work’s doubled since they came onboard. It’s not fair to lay this all on one person.”\n\n \n\n He exhales loudly through his nose, flipping the page. “You know what’s not fair? Hudsons don’t have their boiler. I’ve got suppliers breathing down my neck, and I'm missing a programmer who apparently needs a support group to manage their calendar.”\n\n \n\n You try again. “All I’m saying is maybe you speak to them before assuming the worst.”\n\n \n\n That finally gets his eyes on you. Cold. Sharp. “You think I don’t know how to manage my own damn staff?”\n\n \n\n “No, I -”\n\n \n\n He slams the stack of papers down on the desk with a thud. “Then don’t tell me how to do my job.”\n\n \n\n You swallow your words. Thompson pulls another envelope from the pile and waves a hand toward the door without looking at you.\n\n \n\n “Get out of my office, Annie. Before you say something that puts you on the list next.”\n\n \n\n Your throat tightens, but you nod. You stand and turn to leave, catching the typewriter in your periphery. The keys still glow faintly, hungry for fingers that never touched them.\n\n \n\n You may have avoided the spellwork, but next time won't be fun for you.\n\n \n\n If you actually come in as you, that is.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n You open your mouth… then close it again. Thompson is already red in the face, his eyes scanning the report like it personally betrayed him. Anything you say now could land you in deeper trouble.\n\n \n\n So you just nod slightly and fold your hands in your lap.\n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t even look at you. “Goddamn waste of salary,” he mutters, dragging a file across the desk. “Should’ve let Phillips go when I had the chance.”\n\n \n\n The typewriter beside you buzzes faintly, hungry for attention. You keep your eyes away from it.\n\n \n\n Finally, Thompson exhales and gestures toward the door without lifting his head. \"I'm too busy with this mess to deal with your typing, Annie. You’re dismissed.\"\n\n \n\n You stand without a word, your shoes quiet on the carpet. As you open the door, you glance at the typewriter. The glow of the typewriter keys fades as you move away.\n\n \n\n You survived Thompson this time. But you wonder what waits for you next.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n\n **Thompson's Handyman Repairs - Thompson's Office**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Office_Thompson.png]\n\n \nA cluttered and cramped office, lined with filing cabinets. An imposing desk is the centerpiece, covered in files and paperwork.\n\n \n \n You enter the office, the dark oak wood lit by office lamps and the blinds pulled down. Thompson sits behind his desk, straining as he reviews papers. “Annie,” he says. “Take a seat.”\n\n \n\n You step forward towards his desk and spot an object in front of the seat immediately. Sitting on the desk beside a pile of thick envelopes is a black, boxy typewriter - matte casing, faint gold engraving curling around the edges, and yellowed keys. Keys that fizzle with magic. \n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t notice your hesitation. More concerningly, he's not even paying attention to you. He's still reading the paperwork in front of him. \"I know you didn't want to type anymore, Annie. But I really need some correspondence sent out,\" he mutters whilst looking down. \"About -\"\n\n \n\n He abruptly stops talking as he slams a fist down on to the table. \"Goddamn it!\"\n\n \n\n A moment of silent tension fills the room. You freeze, feeling adrenaline rushing through your body.\n\n \n \n \"Goddamn Phillips!\" Thompson begins. \"Look at this report! The addresses are all wrong! If they can't even take an address down correctly, what the hell am I paying them for? And where are they? That little shit isn't responding to any of my messages.\"\n\n \n\n You eye the older man carefully. His face is red with frustration. You can sense he's ready to explode still. But you need to do something, otherwise Thompson is going to really be mad at you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [Saucy Secretary] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n\n You don’t even think.

    "text": "**Your home**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home.png]\n\n \nYour family home has an open-plan kitchen within the living room. A large table separates the kitchen space from the lounge area, which boasts a big sofa and a giant TV at the other end.\n\n \n\n \n You rush down the stairs to find Emily standing in the hallway, tears streaming down her face. She shakily holds out a letter to you - the Charlton Upper School crest clear and ominous at the top.\n\n \n\n \"They've expelled me,\" she chokes out, her voice trembling with despair.\n\n \n\n \n Without hesitation, you step forward and wrap her gently in your arms. Emily collapses into your embrace, sobbing against your shoulder. Her voice cracks as she whispers desperately, \"Is there anything we can do? Anything at all?\"\n\n \n\n You gently stroke her hair, knowing how hard you've both tried. Your heart sinks; you remember Stitch’s warnings all too clearly.\n\n \n\n \"We'll figure something out,\" you whisper reassuringly, even as dread settles into your bones.\n\n \n You reach out instinctively to comfort Emily, but she recoils sharply from your touch.\n\n \n\n \"Don’t,\" she hisses bitterly, eyes narrowed with hurt and anger. \"This is your fault! You didn't help! You didn't do anything!\"\n\n \n\n \"Emily, that's not true -\" you begin, but she's already turning away.\n\n \n\n \"Don't bother,\" she snaps. With tears still wet on her cheeks, she grabs her jacket and storms out the front door, slamming it hard enough to make the windows rattle.\n\n \n\n You're left standing alone in the hall, the weight of your failures pressing down on your shoulders.\n\n \n \n \n Groggily hearing downstairs, you hear the catchy, unapologetic refrain ringing clearly: \"Can't tell me nothing, gonna live my own way...\"\n\n \n\n You find Emily in the living room, energetically dancing, completely oblivious to the world around her as she belts out the lyrics, her voice ringing boldly through the house. She notices you entering, flashing a carefree grin and holding up a piece of paper.\n\n \n\n \"It's finally happened!\" she shouts gleefully over the pounding music. \"Expelled! No more school, no more rules!\"\n\n \n\n She tosses the letter onto the couch dismissively. \"Good riddance. School was just holding me back anyway.\" Her eyes sparkle mischievously.\n\n \n\n \n \"Maybe I'll see if Coach Beach wants me to clean up his apartment sometime. Who knows what might happen now he's not my teacher anymore?\" She laughs, teasing and unashamed.\n\n \"This gives me more time to get ready for my date with Jake tonight anyway. I think I'll wear something he'll really like.\"\n\n \"More time for me to get ready for my date with Brendan tonight. Might as well spend effort looking cute, as school's not a worry anymore.\"\n\n \n \n\n She spins away from you, returning to her exuberant dancing, seemingly delighted by her newfound freedom.\n\n \n Descending the stairs, you find Emily dancing without restraint, her movements wild, defiant, completely indifferent to your arrival.\n\n \n\n She glances over her shoulder, holding up an official-looking letter with Charlton Upper School's crest. \"Guess what? They finally kicked me out,\" she smirks, rolling her eyes dismissively. \"Not like you'd care.\"\n\n \n\n She tosses the letter onto the couch carelessly. \"Honestly, I'm relieved. School was pointless anyway.\"\n\n \n\n \n She gives a defiant grin. \"Maybe now I'll go see if Coach Beach needs his apartment cleaned. I bet he'd appreciate my company -- especially now he's not my teacher.\"\n\n \"At least this gives me more time to get ready for my date with Jake. Not that it's any of your business.\"\n\n \"Means more time to get ready for Brendan tonight. At least he knows how to treat me well.\"\n\n \n \n\n Without waiting for your reply, she turns her back, cranking the music louder as she resumes dancing - purposefully ignoring your presence. You're left standing awkwardly, the painful gulf between you clearer than ever.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n **Your home**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home.png]\n\n \n\n \n You are sitting in your living room at the kitchen table in the morning, idly flipping through the latest issue of the Charlton Gazette. The soft creak of footsteps on the stairs draws your attention, and you look up to see Emily slowly descending, dressed reluctantly in her Charlton Hotel uniform - the short, frilled French Maid costume that has become a symbol of her new life.\n\n \n\n The last two months have clearly worn on her. Emily's previous spark seems diminished, her eyes duller, demeanor subdued and apologetic. Charlton has left its mark. She's quieter, uncertain, resigned to a life she never envisioned for herself, and yet unwilling or unable to fight it anymore. Faced with her resignation, you found yourself avoiding the amulet. You barely remember when you last saw it. The investigation, with Emily's growing acceptance, seems so irrelevant now.\n\n \n\n You glance pointedly at her uniform. \"Are you sure you should wear that outside?\"\n\n \n\n Emily shrugs weakly, her voice small but resigned. \"It'll be fine. Lennox already criticizes me constantly. One more thing won't matter. Besides, is picking me up.\"\n\n \n\n There's still a faint hint of rebellion in her voice, but it's buried beneath layers of resignation and defeat.\n\n \n\n You hesitate briefly, then carefully ask about .\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Emily hesitates, voice low and conflicted. \"Coach Beach is... complicated. He’s protective. He's older, sure, but at least he cares. It's not like he has a wife or anything.\" She pauses awkwardly, avoiding your eyes. \"He's introduced me to some of his friends. Or, at least, I've waitressed for them during football matches.\n\n \n\n She holds your stare for a moment, then looks down. \"I wouldn't have chosen this,\" she mutters. \"But it's something to hold onto.\"\n\n \n Emily sighs softly. \"Jake wouldn't have been my first choice, but at least he's protective of me.\" She pauses, guilt flickering in her eyes. \"I know you tried your best, but... I just wish things hadn't ended up this way.\"\n\n \n\n When you cautiously ask if Jake is officially her boyfriend now, she winces faintly. \"He's still seeing Christina, technically. But beggars can't be choosers. Not in Charlton.\"\n \n \n \"Brendan’s nice enough,\" she admits softly, her voice weary. \"A bit of a meathead, but protective. He’s broken things off with Chantelle, at least, or so he says.\"\n\n \n\n Her gaze drifts, filled with quiet resignation. \"He's even talking about working at Thompson's Repairs when he graduates, starting a family... It's all happening faster than I'd like, but maybe it's what Charlton expects.\"\n\n \n \n\n Emily manages a meek, almost apologetic smile as she heads out the door. You watch your sister go, guilt and regret weighing heavily on your shoulders. Your parents are furious about Emily dropping out, but even without their anger, you know your time in Charlton is done. You can't shake the sadness at what's become of Emily, and fear for what her future now holds.\n\n \n \n She crosses her arms, eyes challenging you. \"Coach Beach will look after me - better than you did, anyway. I don't care what you think about his age.\"\n\n \n\n When you ask cautiously if something is happening between them, she replies curtly, \"What do you care?\"\n \n \n She looks away sharply, defensive. \"Jake actually looks out for me. Better than you ever did, even if he is a bit rough sometimes.\"\n\n \n\n When you cautiously ask if he's her boyfriend now, she snaps defensively, \"It's complicated - not that you'd care.\"\n \n \n Emily gives you a cool glance. \"Brendan's more protective of me than you've ever been. He's even talked about settling down, you know.\"\n\n \n\n When you gently press further about their relationship, she turns defensive. \"What's it to you? It's none of your business.\"\n\n \n \n\n Emily doesn't wait for your response, turning away sharply. She heads out the door without another glance in your direction, leaving a painful silence behind.\n\n \n\n You watch your sister leave, regret heavy in your chest. Your parents are enraged that Emily dropped out of school. Without their support, and now feeling disconnected from your own sister, you know your time in Charlton has come to a bitter end. Guilt gnaws at you as you wonder what her future holds - and if she'll ever forgive you.\n\n \n \n You are sitting at the kitchen table, idly flipping through the latest Charlton Gazette. Footsteps echo lightly down the staircase, and you glance up to see Emily enter, dressed confidently in the Charlton Hotel’s uniform - a short, revealing French Maid costume.\n\n \n\n Emily has embraced Charlton more than you ever imagined. Her demeanor has shifted drastically - flirty, carefree, and decidedly ditzy. Her previous interests have vanished, replaced entirely by fashion, makeup, and boys. Plenty of boys. Whenever she's not working, she's out on dates. You can't remember the last time you used the amulet. Or saw it, even. With her embracement of her new life, it almost seemed like a second betrayal trying to rectify the situation.\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow at her uniform. She giggles, spinning playfully. \"What's wrong? Jealous?\" she teases, flaunting her outfit. She shrugs breezily. \"Anyway, is driving me today, so I'll be fine. Besides, Lennox loves me. I know exactly how to wrap him around my finger.\"\n\n \n\n She giggles suggestively, clearly implying how she secures special treatment from the hotel staff.\n\n \n\n Cautiously, you ask about .\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Emily grins boldly, clearly enjoying your surprise. \"Coach Beach might be older, but he's not boring. He's even introduced me to some of his friends - I served beer for them during the football games. You should've seen their faces when I showed up in this uniform! It's not exactly how I thought things would go, but it's entertaining.\"\n\n \n Emily giggles brightly, eyes sparkling mischievously. \"Jake? He's fun. It’s nice having a big strong footballer protecting me.\" When you ask if they're officially dating, she laughs lightly. \"Christina can have his whining - I just want to have some fun. And trust me, he's plenty of fun.\"\n\n \n Emily smiles, amused but a touch overwhelmed. \"Brendan's sweet, in a meathead kind of way. Protective, at least. He even broke things off with Chantelle - or so he says. He’s already talking about getting a job at Thompson’s Repairs and starting a family when he graduates. It's not exactly what I planned, but who am I to say no? It's kinda fun, for now.\"\n \n \n \n\n Emily gives you a coy smile as she steps out the door. You watch her leave, regret settling heavily in your chest. Your parents' anger over Emily dropping out of school has severed any remaining ties to Charlton. You can't help but wonder with sadness and guilt about Emily’s future, even as she seems perfectly content.\n\n \n \n Emily crosses her arms defiantly. \"Coach Beach actually cares about me, more than you ever have. And before you say anything, I don't care about his age.\" When pressed for details, she snaps, \"It's none of your business.\"\n\n \n Emily dismissively rolls her eyes. \"Really? You suddenly care now? Jake's looking after me, better than you ever did - even if he’s a bit rough sometimes.\" When you hesitantly ask if they're officially dating, she deflects curtly. \"It's complicated. Not that you'd care.\"\n \n \n She narrows her eyes, defensive. \"Brendan's protecting me better than you managed. He's already talking about settling down, actually - which is a bit much, but at least he's serious.\" When you ask if he’s officially her boyfriend, she sharply retorts, \"What's it to you, anyway?\"\n\n \n \n\n Emily strides out without another glance your way. You watch her go, feeling the heavy weight of regret. Your parents are furious that Emily dropped out of school, and without their support - or Emily’s - you realize you have no choice but to leave the secrets of Charlton behind. The guilt remains with you, a constant reminder of your failures.\n\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n **Your home**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home_Caravan.png]\n\n \n\n \n You sit at your kitchen table, pulling at your uniform. It's itchy and it stinks. Which, you reflect, is exactly what you'd expect from the uniform of a garbage collector.\n\n \n\n Unfortunately the smell has seeped into everything in your home. Although it doesn't take much to make the cramped caravan stink.\n\n \n\n You glance around the tiny living space. A scrunched-up sleeping bag rests at the end of the cushion you’ve been using as a makeshift sofa. There’s only one bedroom - you gave that to Emily. Not that she’s here much these days.\n\n \n\n You lean back, sighing. After the house was forfeited, your parents were clear: Emily still had to graduate. That part wasn’t up for debate. You didn’t have many options. You rented a caravan at Misty Falls Caravan Park and took whatever job you could get.\n\n \n\n But Charlton had already made up its mind about the Phillips family. Almost every door was slammed shut. It felt like revenge when the only job offered was cleaning up after the rest of town.\n\n \n You sit at your kitchen table, pulling at your uniform. Try as you might, the skirt won’t come down any further, riding up almost the whole of your thigh. The cropped blouse smells of beer and alcohol, and your feet ache from the high-heels you’re forced to wear. But what else would you expect from the Red Room bar? The dive bar where Charlton's underbelly go to drink, only tolerated because it’s out of town.\n\n \n\n Being outside Charlton seems to be the new reality for you, though. Case in point - where you live. A tiny cabin in the Misty Falls Caravan Park thirty minutes away from your old home.\n\n \n\n You look around the confined space, grimacing. A scrunched-up sleeping bag rests at the end of the cushion that passes for a sofa. The only bedroom went to Emily. Not that she’s here much these days.\n\n \n\n You lean back, exhausted. When the house was forfeited, your parents made one thing clear: Emily still had to graduate. That was non-negotiable. You didn’t have many options. You scraped together what little money you had and rented a caravan at Misty Falls.\n\n \n\n Most businesses in Charlton wouldn’t even look at you. The town had made its judgment on the Phillips family. Petty revenge, maybe, that the only work you could find was serving the town’s dregs in a bar that smells like regret.\n\n \n \n\n The door creaks wide, bringing you out of your reminiscing. And through the small opening, Emily walks in. The smell of cigarette smoke wisping in off her as she enters.\n\n \n\n It’s early - and definitely a school day - but that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. She’s dressed in ripped stockings and a skirt that barely covers her bum. Her makeup is heavy and smeared, her torn leather jacket slung over a stained crop top. You don’t want to know what the stains are.\n\n \n\n Just back from another night out. Another party. Another escape.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Emily steps through the caravan door with a tired shuffle. \"Hey,\" she says softly, eyes lowered. There’s no fight in her tone. Just exhaustion and something close to embarrassment. She lingers in the doorway, not quite meeting your gaze.\n\n \n\n \"Are you going to school today?\" you ask gently.\n\n \n\n She shrugs. \"I dunno. Maybe.\"\n\n \n\n \"Where were you last night?\"\n\n \n\n She hesitates, eyes drifting downward. Beneath the bold makeup, she looks younger. Fragile.\n\n \n Emily sighs. \"Coach Beach's house. He had some friends over to watch the football. They needed entertaining... he has a big living room too.\"\n\n \"I hung out with Jake. We drove around. Parked up. A cramped car feels like home these days.\"\n\n \"Brendan's parents are away. I stayed over. It was... comforting to sleep in a bed.\"\n\n \n \n\n \"You need to concentrate on school,\" you say quietly.\n\n \n\n She nods, but her lip trembles. \"Yeah. I know. It’s just... it all feels so pointless now.\"\n\n \n\n You try to say something reassuring, but the words won’t come. Instead, you offer a smile - a small, tired thing.\n\n \n\n \"Have you spoken to Jennifer?\" she asks.\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"I think that ship has sailed.\"\n\n You shake your head. \"I’ve not had much time to keep up friendships.\"\n\n \n\n She nods slowly, then rubs her eyes. \"I’m tired. I think I’m going to bed. I’ll try to go to school tomorrow.” It doesn’t sound like she means it.\n\n \n\n “Can you call them?” she asks. “Tell them I’m sick.”\n\n \n\n She doesn’t wait for a reply. She slips toward her room and gently pulls the thin, faux-wooden partition shut behind her. Leaving you alone with your thoughts.\n\n \n\n The foreclosure was enough to ruin Emily’s reputation at school. She didn’t drop out, but she might as well have. Dubbed the Caravan Queen, she became the focus of whispers, of judgment. People made assumptions. Assumptions that stuck.\n\n \n\n You tried to protect her. You tried to guide her. But between the long hours of your degrading job and the slow rot of Misty Falls, it wasn’t enough.\n\n \n \n Jennifer tried to help you pull through, but you grew distant. Eventually you just stopped returning her calls. Emily was your priority. She listened to you, respected you. But the influence of Charlton was just too much. In spite of your relationship, she changed.\n\n Some of your friends tried to help, but you grew distant. Eventually you just stopped returning calls to give more time to Emily. She listened to you, respected you. But the influence of Charlton was just too much. In spite of your relationship, she changed.\n \n \n\n You sigh, dragging your bag over your shoulder. Another day in Charlton. Another day playing the role the town carved out for you.\n\n \n\n As you reach for the door, you hear the faint sound of music coming from Emily’s room. Lexi Star’s latest ballad, soft and slow, slips through the thin walls like a lullaby.\n\n \n\n *“If I vanish, will they notice?\n\n \n\n If I scream, will they pretend?\n\n \n\n I used to dream of shining.\n\n \n \n Now I just want the hurt to end.”*\n\n \n Emily steps through the caravan door with a toss of her bag and a casual, \"Hey.\" She doesn't stop to make eye contact, just heads straight for the back of the cabin. \n\n \n\n \"Are you going to school today?\" you call after her.\n\n \n\n She doesn’t break stride. \"What’s it to you?\"\n\n \n\n \"Where were you last night?\"\n\n \n\n She stops and turns to you, glaring. She rolls her eyes.\n \n \n “Like you don’t know already,” she replies. “I was at Beach’s house. At least he has a normal bed.”\n\n “If you must know, I was with Jake. And trust me, you don’t want anymore details than that.”\n\n “Yes, I was at Brendan’s. And yes, I spent the night. And yes, his parents are away. Why would I stay here when he’s got an actual house still?”\n\n \n \n \n “Is that how you want to live your life?” you try. “Staying out all night with guys?”\n\n \n\n Emily scowls at you, enraged. “Give me a break. Just because Jennifer dumped you, doesn't mean that everyone else should live like an incel.”\n\n Emily snorts. “Leave it alone. Just because you act like a nun, doesn't mean that other people don't need attention.”\n\n \n\n You open your mouth to respond, but she storms off, yanking the thin, faux-wooden partition shut with a slam that reverberates through the entire caravan. You sit in the stillness, the air thick with tension and a hundred words left unsaid.\n\n \n\n The foreclosure was enough to destroy Emily’s reputation at school. She didn’t officially drop out, but she might as well have. Rumors circled like vultures, dubbing her the Caravan Queen. It didn’t take long before the insinuations started: names, labels, all the things people assumed about girls from a trailer park.\n\n \n\n You tried to hold her back. Tried to guide her. But between your exhausting job, the emotional weight of everything you’d lost, and the toxic influence of Misty Falls... it was hopeless.\n\n \n\n Jennifer tried to help you pull through, but you grew distant. Eventually you just stopped returning her calls. Emily was your priority. But too little, too late. The damage between you and her had already been done.\n\n Some of your friends tried to help, but you grew distant. Eventually you just stopped returning calls to give more time to Emily. But too little, too late. The damage between you and her had already been done.\n\n \n\n You sigh, standing up and grabbing your bag. Another day in Charlton. Another day living out the role the town has written for you.\n\n \n\n As you move toward the door, you hear the muffled thump of bass from Emily’s room. Lexi Star’s latest anthem blasts through her cheap stereo. Saccharine, biting, and painfully on brand.\n\n \n\n *“You call it falling, I call it flying.\n\n \n\n You say I’m lost, but I’m just not trying.\n\n \n\n Let the whispers talk, let the curtains twitch,\n\n \n\n I’d rather be a mess than someone’s fix...”*\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

Nothing, however, seems treasured. \n\nUntil your eyes fall on a photo frame on the shelves, tucked behind a plant. You move over to it, brushing aside the leaves to see more.\n\nThe photo is of two girls sitting outside on a beautiful cloudless day, smiling brightly at the camera. One of them you instantly recognise as Annie, although she looks a year or two younger. The other you’ve never seen before. Her dark hair contrasts with her pale skin, her eyes are dark to the point where you can barely separate her pupils from their iris. \n\nThe two of them sit on a grass verge, legs sprawled across each other, their temples leaning against each other. Both look carefree. Happy. Innocent.\n \n\n “Friend of yours?” you ask Annie, as she continues to mix you both some drinks.\n\n \n\n She looks over at you and her eyes linger on the frame for a moment. Then she turns back to cutting up a lime for the gin. “Penny,” she says, her back turned to you. “We went to Charlton together. We were... friends.”\n\n \n\n “Just friends?” you ask.\n\n \n\n \n Annie stops cutting and turns to face you. Her smile gone, but not replaced with anger or pain. To the best of your reading, she just seems confused. You catch sight of her blushing slightly.\n\n \n\n She glances at the frame again, then back to you. “Girls are made for boys, .” she says without feeling.\n\n \n\n She looks at you with confused eyes, almost faltering. “Of course,” she says quietly. “That’s what they taught us at school.”\n\n \n\n Annie turns back to preparing your cocktails.

A genuine, belly-shaking laugh. \"The amount of times I've had to pretend to care about football and listen to how hard it is to install a new boiler,\" she blurts out. \"The things we listen to just for a little affection.\"\n\n \n\n You offer Annie a grin of sympathy. She takes a sip from her drink and almost chokes from the alcohol. \"I promise you that my girl's nights out don't always end in deep and meaningfuls on my sofa.\"\n\n \n\n \"That's okay,\" you tell her. \"Just so long as we balance them out with a bit of fun.\"\n\n \n\n Annie's sparkle returns to her eyes. \"I promise I'll try to avoid it, next time. There's plenty to do around Charlton for two single ladies.\"\n\n \n\n You chuckle and take a sip of your own drink. Annie reclines, taking a plush cushion and hugging it to her stomach.\n\n \n\n \"I think I had too much to drink,\" she mumbles. \"Would you mind if we called it a night?\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"Sure. I'll see you tomorrow?\"\n\n \n\n She grins. \"Count on it. And ? Thank you. It's not often people are nice to me. Without wanting something in return. If you ever want to come around for a chat, I'm usually home on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Despite what some people in town say.\"\n\n \n\n You give Annie a look, but nod instead of prying. \"Night Annie,\" you say as you stand.\n\n \n\n \"Night\", she says to you, stifling a yawn.\n\n \n She laughs. A genuine, belly-shaking laugh. \"The amount of times I've had to pretend to care about football and listen to how hard it is to install a new boiler,\" she blurts out. \"The things we have to listen to.\"\n\n \n\n You offer Annie a grin of sympathy. She takes a sip from her drink and almost chokes from the alcohol. \"I promise you that my girl's nights out don't always end in deep and meaningfuls on my sofa.\"\n\n \n\n \"That's okay,\" you tell her. \"Just so long as we balance them out with a bit of fun.\"\n\n \n\n Annie's sparkle returns to her eyes. \"I promise I'll try to avoid it, next time. There's plenty to do around Charlton.\" She pauses, eying you carefully. \"I can show you, if you like.\"\n\n \n\n You nod and Annie smiles appreciatively, watching you take a sip of your own drink. She reclines, taking a plush cushion and hugging it to her stomach.\n\n \n\n \"I think I had too much to drink,\" she mumbles. \"Would you mind if we called it a night?\"\n\n \n\n You shake your head. \"Sure. I'll see you tomorrow?\"\n\n \n\n She grins. \"Count on it. And ? Thank you. I like spending time with you. If you ever want to come, I'm usually home on Saturday and Sunday mornings.\"\n\n \n\n You nod. \"Night Annie,\" you say as you stand.\n\n \n\n \"Night\", she says to you, stifling a yawn.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Leaning in, you brush your lips against hers. \"Yes,\" you whisper. \"I'm more than okay.\"\n\n \n\n You see her smile before you close your eyes. You feel her lips gently pressing upon yours, her tongue slowly entwining around yours, each of you exploring each other tenderly.\n\n \n\n Her fingers press into your thigh, holding it gently as she continues to kiss you. She caresses your leg, cautious and hesitant. You reach down and slide your fingers through hers, moving her grip between your legs.\n\n \n\n She pulls back her mouth and giggles nervously, smiling at you. \"This is a bit new to me,\" she whispers. \"Or at least, it's not what I'm used to.\"\n\n \n\n You offer her a smile of your own. \"It's okay,\" you say. \"We can take it slow.\"\n\n \n\n She nods and leans in for another kiss. This time more confident. Full of longing. And desire. Her hand, still wrapped around yours, massages the inner of your thigh.\n\n \n\n After what seems an eternity, she pulls back. Her cheeks are flustered, but her smile giddy. \"Do you want to...\" she begins. \"Do you want to go into the bedroom?\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Alright,” you reply. “I’ll stay.”\n\n \n\n She flashes you a grin, then stands and turns on her heels. “Great! Do you mind cleaning up? I just want to tidy a few things.”\n\n \n\n Before you can nod, Annie has skipped off through a door. One, you assume, to her bedroom.\n\n \n\n You take the glasses and tip the mostly untouched drinks down the sink, placing them in the drying rack. The apartment seems quieter without Annie. Even though the vintage furniture and lamps retain her essence even when she’s not here.\n\n \n\n A door opens and Annie’s head looks out. “You can come in,” she purrs.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"I think we should take it slow,\" you tell her. Before you can see the disappointment on her face, you lean in for another kiss.\n\n \n\n \"Okay,\" she says once you part from each other. \"I guess that makes sense.\"\n\n \n\n \"There's plenty of time,\" you tell her with a grin. She giggles as you look at her.\n\n \n\n \"Don't wait too long,\" she tells you with a coy smile. \"I have a lifetime to catch up on.\"\n\n \n\n You grin. Except, your eye can't help but wander over to the shelves. And your mind dwells on the photo of Annie and Penny.\n\n \n\n \"How about another night at McTafeys?\" you hear Annie say, bringing you out of your thoughts. \"Or, there's other places I can take you. Out of town.\"\n\n \n\n Smiling, you lean in and press your lips to hers once more. \"That would be nice,\" you murmur after you break from the kiss.\n\n \n\n You stand, straightening your clothes. She titters again. \"I'm glad you moved here, ,\" she says.\n\n \n\n \"Me too,\" you reply. You reach down and give her another kiss. \"I'll see you soon, Annie.\"\n\n \n\n She grins. \"Count on it.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You pull back. Just a little, but enough for Annie to get the message.\n\n \n \n “I’m sorry, Annie,” you tell her. “I just can't do this.”\n\n \n\n There is a long moment of silence, as Annie digests the rejection. Then she edges back herself, pushing her back into the other side of the sofa.\n\n \n\n “I think you should leave,” she tells you.\n\n \n\n You give her a look of sympathy, but she doesn’t react. You nod, almost instinctively, and stand. You consider what to say to her, but she doesn’t look up.\n\n \n\n Instead, you head towards the door. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You say nothing. It’s enough encouragement for Annie to continue.\n\n \n\n Her lips touch yours and you feel the smooth texture of lipgloss against your own. She is tender, soft, but assertive. You find yourself kissing her back, as your lips connect with hers and her mouth begins to explore your tongue.\n\n \n\n As it does so, you feel her hand drift further up your leg, finding your stiffening member underneath your pants. She wraps her fingers around it through the fabric, and begins to stroke it. \n\n \n\n “Someone’s excited.” she says, after she pulls back from the kiss, grinning.\n\n \n\n With a flick of a nail, you feel your zipper being pulled down and your top button undone. Annie grins, not looking away from you, as her hand reaches inside your boxers. \n\n \n\n \n “Very excited,” she purrs, as you feel her fingers clasp your shaft. \n\n \n\n You can’t help but gasp as she pulls it free from your boxers, running her fingers up and down as it stiffens. She glances down momentarily, then runs the tip of her tongue over her lips. “Do you want me to suck your dick, ?”\n\n \n “Quite excited,” she purrs, as you feel her fingers clasp your shaft.\n\n \n\n You can’t help but gasp as she pulls your dick free from your boxers, running her fingers up and down as it stiffens. She glances down momentarily, smiling when she sees it. Then runs the tip of her tongue over her lips. \"Do you want me to suck your dick, ?\"\n\n \n “Like this, do you?” she purrs, as you feel her fingers clasp your shaft.\n\n \n\n You can’t help but gasp as she pulls your dick free from your boxers, running her fingers up and down as it stiffens. She glances down momentarily, then runs the tip of her tongue over her lips. \"Do you want me to suck your dick, ?\"\n\n \n “Hmmm” she purrs, as you feel her fingers clasp your shaft.\n\n \n\n You can’t help but gasp as she pulls your small dick free from your boxers, grasping it in her fingers as it stiffens. She glances down momentarily and you don’t fail to notice the look of disappointment on her face. Within a moment it’s gone and she runs the tip of her tongue over her lips. “Do you want me to suck your dick, ?”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You scramble back down the sofa, out of range for her lips. \n\n \n\n Her hand falls back and you immediately see her eyes look over you, incredulously. \n\n \n\n “I’m sorry, Annie,” you tell her. “I just can’t do this.”\n\n \n\n There is a long moment of silence, as Annie digests the rejection. Then she edges back herself, pushing her back into the other side of the sofa. \n\n \n\n “I think you should leave,” she tells you.\n\n \n\n You give her a look of sympathy, but she doesn’t react. You nod, almost instinctively, and stand. You consider what to say to her, but she doesn’t look up.\n\n \n\n Instead, you head towards the door. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n “Oh yes,” you stammer without thinking. \n\n \n \n\n Annie grins and you watch as she slinks off the sofa and kneels down on the floor. Still stroking your thick shaft, she uses her other hand to push your legs open and slides in between them, staring up at you as she leans forward towards your erect penis.\n\n \n\n Keeping eye contact, she sticks out her tongue and gingerly licks your tip, grinning as you nervously jolt at her touch.\n\n \n\n Wordlessly, she then opens her mouth and takes the top of your prick between her glossy lips.\n\n \n\n You moan as she works your dick further and further into her mouth, struggling to fit it in, smearing her shiny lipstick on your skin and not letting her eyes drift from yours for one moment. Her fingers drift back down to playing with your balls, feeling tight and hard at the stimulation.\n\n \n\n “Cum for me, ,” Annie says to you after she momentarily takes your penis out of her mouth with a plop. “Cum right down my throat.”\n\n \n\n Then she’s back down, her head buried in your groin, her blue eyes staring up at you as her blonde hair spreads out over your thighs.\n\n \n\n You can’t hold back longer. Digging your fingers into the sofa, you grunt as you release over and over again in Annie’s mouth. She almost chokes from the amount, but manages to retain staring up at you, working her lips around your prick, as if she was milking your semen from your dick.\n\n \n\n With a final spurt, you fall back, spent. You look down at Annie, who pulls back off your penis and giggles. “That was a lot. Been a while hasn't it, .”\n \n \n \n\n Annie grins and you watch as she slinks off the sofa and kneels down on the floor. Still stroking your shaft, she uses her other hand to push your legs open and slides in between them, staring up at you as she leans forward towards your erect penis.\n\n \n\n Keeping eye contact, she sticks out her tongue and gingerly licks your tip, grinning as you nervously jolt at her touch.\n\n \n\n Wordlessly, she then opens her mouth and takes the top of your prick between her glossy lips.\n\n \n\n You moan as she works your dick further and further into her mouth, smearing her shiny lipstick on your skin and not letting her eyes drift from yours for one moment.

Digging your fingers into the sofa, you grunt as you release over and over again in Annie’s mouth. She stares up at you, working her lips around your prick, as if she was milking your semen from your dick.\n\n \n\n With a final spurt, you fall back, spent. You look down at Annie, who pulls back off your penis and giggles. “Been a while, ?”\n \n \n \n\n Annie grins and you watch as she slinks off the sofa and kneels down on the floor. Still stroking your shaft, she uses her other hand to push your legs open and slides in between them, staring up at you as she leans forward towards your erect penis.\n\n \n\n Keeping eye contact, she sticks out her tongue and gingerly licks your tip, grinning as you nervously jolt at her touch.\n\n \n\n Wordlessly, she then opens her mouth and takes the majority of your prick between her glossy lips.\n\n \n\n You moan as she quickly takes your dick further into her mouth without a challenge, not letting her eyes drift from yours for one moment. Her fingers drift back down to playing with your balls, feeling tight and hard at the stimulation.\n\n \n\n “Cum for me, ,” Annie says to you after she momentarily takes your penis out of her mouth with a plop. “Cum right down my throat.”\n\n \n\n Then she’s back down, her head buried in your groin, her blue eyes staring up at you as her blonde hair spreads out over your thighs.\n\n \n\n You can’t hold back longer. Digging your fingers into the sofa, you grunt as you release in Annie’s mouth. She stares up at you, working her lips around your prick, as if she was milking your semen from your dick.\n\n \n\n You fall back, spent. You look down at Annie, who pulls back off your penis and giggles. “Expected a bit more, . Has Jennifer actually been taking care of you?”\n \n \n \n\n Annie grins and you watch as she slinks off the sofa and kneels down on the floor. Still holding you shaft easily in her hand, she uses her other hand to push your legs open and slides in between them, staring up at you as she leans forward towards your erect penis.\n\n \n\n Keeping eye contact, she sticks out her tongue and gingerly licks your dick, grinning as you nervously jolt at her touch.\n\n \n\n Wordlessly, she then opens her mouth and puts your prick easily between her glossy lips.\n\n \n\n You moan as she runs her tongue around your small dick, not letting her eyes drift from yours for one moment. Her fingers drift back down to playing with your balls, feeling tight and hard at the stimulation.\n\n \n\n “Cum for me, ,” Annie says to you after she momentarily takes your penis out of her mouth with a plop. “Cum right down my throat.”\n\n \n\n Then she’s back down, her head buried in your groin, her blue eyes staring up at you as her blonde hair spreads out over your thighs.\n\n \n\n You can’t hold back longer. Digging your fingers into the sofa, you grunt as you release in Annie’s mouth. She stares up at you, working her lips around your prick, as if she was milking your semen from your dick.\n\n \n\n You fall back, spent. You look down at Annie, who pulls back off your penis and giggles. “There wasn't much there. You didn’t jack off before our date, did you ? Or did you see Jennifer beforehand? Naughty.”\n\n \n \n\n You look at the blonde bombshell, still kneeling between your legs. You grimace. You don’t want to think of Jennifer right now.\n\n \n\n After a moment, Annie excuses herself and goes to the bathroom. Whilst she’s gone, you grab a tissue and clean yourself up. \n\n \n\n When Annie returns, you are already on your feet. “I should go,” you say.\n\n \n\n \n Annie looks at you, curiously. “You can stay, if you like? After all, we don’t have to work tomorrow.”\n\n \n\n You glance back at her, considering it. Jennifer lives opposite. It’s one thing to sneak into here in the middle of the night. But walking out in broad daylight. You are asking for trouble.\n\n \n\n But looking back at Annie, you find yourself drawn by her white smile. And those perfectly glossed lips that moments ago, were wrapped around your dick. They both promise so much more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n She nods. “I guess we do have work tomorrow.” There’s a grin on her face. “Don’t worry, . I will play innocent.”\n\n \n\n You find yourself blushing. It’s enough to set her into a giggle. “Sleep tight,” she adds. “Hope you’ll be thinking about my… eyes.”\n\n \n\n She follows you to the door and opens it for you. Smiling as you say goodbye.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n “Just, keep going,” you tell her, hearing your hoarse words through your soft grunting.\n\n \n\n Annie’s grin widens and she quickens her pace. “Getting close, ?”\n\n \n\n \n Her hand roughly and quickly moves up and down your giant erect prick, barely able to grasp it, jacking it off with frenzy. “Oh god,” you hear your voice stammer.\n\n \n\n “Are you going to cum for me?” Annie whispers to you. “Cum for little Annie? Go on, . Cum. Cum all over my hand.”\n\n \n\n It’s too much for you. With a grip on her shoulder, you feel penis spurt, propelling a thick spurt of jism up into the air. It falls back over your exposed groin and Annie’s fingers. Again and again, white semen launching up and down. And one final release, this time flowing from the tip down your shaft.\n\n \n\n Annie looks at you in the face. Without taking her eyes away, she raises her hand to her mouth and licks your cum off her fingers like a cat lapping up water.\n\n \n\n She smiles, wide-eyed. “That was a lot,” she purrs. \n\n \n Her hand roughly and quickly moves up and down your erect prick, jacking it off with frenzy. “Oh god,” you hear your voice stammer.\n\n \n\n “Are you going to cum for me?” Annie whispers to you. “Cum for little Annie? Go on, . Cum. Cum all over my hand.”\n\n \n\n It’s too much for you. With a grip on her shoulder, you feel penis spurt, propelling jism up into the air. It falls back over your exposed groin and Annie’s fingers. Within moments another strand of white semen launches up into the air, and falls back down. And then a final release, this time flowing from the tip down your shaft.\n\n \n\n Annie looks at you in the face. Without taking her eyes away, she raises her hand to her mouth and licks your cum off her fingers like a cat lapping up water.\n\n \n\n She smiles, coyly. “That was… nice.” she purrs.\n \n \n Her hand roughly and quickly holds your erect prick in her hand, massaging it vigorously. “Oh god,” you hear your voice stammer.\n\n \n\n “Are you going to cum for me?” Annie whispers to you. “Cum for little Annie? Go on, . Cum. Cum all over my hand.”\n\n \n\n It’s too much for you. With a grip on her shoulder, you feel penis spurt, jism flowing from the tip down your shaft over Annie’s fingers. \n\n \n \n Annie looks at you in the face. Without taking her eyes away, she raises her hand to her mouth and licks your cum off her fingers like a cat lapping up water.\n\n \n\n She smiles, politely. “Mmmm.” she purrs.\n\n \n Her hand roughly and quickly holds your prick easily in hand, rubbing it quickly with two fingers. “Oh god,” you hear your voice stammer.\n\n \n\n “Are you going to cum for me?” Annie whispers to you. “Cum for little Annie? Go on, . Cum. Cum all over my hand.”\n\n \n\n It’s too much for you. With a grip on her shoulder, you feel penis spurt, jism running weakly down over Annie’s hands. \n\n \n\n Annie looks at you in the face. Without taking her eyes away, she raises her hand to her mouth and licks your cum off her fingers like a cat lapping up water.\n\n \n\n She looks up at you, slightly distracted. She says nothing.\n\n \n \n\n You spend a few minutes relaxing, Annie casually running her finger along the back of your neck. Once you’ve regained your breath, you excuse yourself and go to the bathroom to clean yourself up. You return to see Annie still sitting on the sofa.\n\n \n\n “I should go,” you tell her when she looks up at you. \n\n \n\n \n Annie looks at you, curiously. “You can stay, if you like? After all, we don’t have to work tomorrow.”\n\n \n\n You glance back at her, considering it. Jennifer lives opposite. It’s one thing to sneak into here in the middle of the night.

It’s enough to set her into a giggle. “Sleep tight,” she adds. “Hope you’ll be thinking about my… eyes.”\n\n \n\n She follows you to the door and opens it for you. Smiling as you say goodbye.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n\n You reach down quickly and gently move her hand away. “I can’t, Annie. I’m sorry.”\n\n \n\n She lets you move her hand back, then watches you curiously as you button up your pants again. “I shouldn’t have done that,” you stammer.\n\n \n\n Annie just grins. “Aren’t you the faithful one, ?” she mocks you. “I think we both know what you really want, though.”\n\n \n\n You stand, looking down at Annie, stretched out over the sofa like a cat. “I should go.”\n\n \n\n Heading towards the door, you don't turn back as Annie starts to speak. “See you at work, . If not sooner.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n “Alright,” you reply. “I’ll stay.”\n\n \n\n She flashes you a grin, then turns on her heels. “Great! Do you mind cleaning up? I just want to tidy a few things.”\n\n \n\n Before you can nod, Annie has skipped off through a door. One, you assume, to her bedroom.\n\n \n\n You take the glasses and tip the mostly untouched drinks down the sink, placing them in the drying rack. The apartment seems quieter without Annie. Even though the vintage furniture and lamps retain her essence even when she’s not here.\n\n \n\n A door opens and Annie’s head looks out. “You can come in,” she purrs.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “I really shouldn’t,” you reply.\n\n \n\n She almost pouts, but nods. “Alright . It’s been fun. We should do this again sometime.”\n\n \n\n You nod, but say nothing. Instead you give her a polite smile, then quickly move to the door.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

You cry out as waves of yellow energy blow out away from your body. Ignoring the pain, you instead focus on the mental image within your mind.\n\n \n\n *A bombshell. Long, golden blonde hair.

You strain against the yearning to pass out, straining to keep your brain locked on to the image of the receptionist who's greeted you every day for months. \n\n \n\n You feel the balls of your feet rise up, up, up.

Staring back at you is Annie, her mouth open. \"I'm never going to get used to that,\" she murmurs.\n \n \n\n You shrug, growing accustomed to feeling from the new form once more. \"I better get going,\" you mutter.\n\n \n\n She offers you a grateful smile. \"Thank you,\" she says. \"Just try to act like me.

    "text": "You sift through the wardrobe, fingers brushing against soft, flowing fabric before pulling out a dress. It’s light, simple, the kind of thing Emily would wear on a casual summer day. There’s something about it that feels effortless yet put together.\n\n \n\n You hold it up against yourself, tilting your head in consideration. It’s a safe choice. Not too much, not too little. Pretty, but practical.\n\n \n\n Setting it aside, you reach down for a pair of flats, the natural companion to the outfit. With everything laid out neatly on the bed, you inhale deeply before starting to change.\n\n \n\n As the fabric settles against your skin, the outfit feels… comfortable. Like you belong in it.\n\n \n\n And that thought lingers longer than it should.\n\n \n \n <> \n \n Slipping into the dress, you barely give it a second thought. The fabric rests comfortably against your skin, the fit familiar, effortless. It’s just another outfit now, something you pull on without thinking, because why wouldn’t you? It’s easy, stylish, and it suits you. \n\n \n \n <> \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n \n Your fingers trail over a few casual tops before stopping on something different. A skirt, fitted but not too tight, stylish without being overly bold. It does look quite short, though.\n\n \n\n You pull it from the hanger, holding it up in front of you. It’s not the kind of thing Emily wore all the time, but you'd seen her in it a few times. When she wanted to stand out a little.\n\n \n\n You find a flattering top to match, something that fits just right, and lay them both on the bed. The low-cut neckline gives you pause for thought. You know how much will be on display by wearing it. But something draws you to it, all the same.\n\n \n\n Reaching down, you pick out a pair of ankle boots with a high heel, completing the look.\n\n \n\n As you start to change, the outfit comes together effortlessly. When you finally look in the mirror, there’s something about it that feels… natural.\n\n \n\n Like this isn’t a disguise at all.\n\n \n\n Like maybe, just maybe, it suits you.\n\n \n \n <>\n \n You fasten the skirt without hesitation, pairing it with whatever top feels right. The snug fit, the way it hugs your waist just enough. It all feels natural now, like something you’ve always worn. There’s no pause, no second-guessing. It’s just a part of your wardrobe.\n\n \n \n <>\n \n\n *Your?*\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n \n Your eyes land on the bold red and white fabric, neatly folded among the rest of the wardrobe’s contents.\n\n \n\n The cheerleader uniform.\n\n \n\n You hesitate for only a second before reaching for it, unfolding the pleated skirt and fitted top, taking in the smooth, athletic material beneath your fingertips. It’s bright, unmistakable, a symbol of status and belonging.\n\n \n\n You change quickly, slipping into the uniform with practiced ease, adjusting the hem, smoothing out the pleats. It fits perfectly, the fabric snug yet flexible, designed for movement.\n\n \n\n You glance at yourself in the mirror. This isn’t just an outfit. It's a role. A position. A statement. You’re a cheerleader now.\n\n \n \n <> \n \n You pull on the uniform with quick, practiced movements, adjusting the skirt and smoothing the fitted top into place. The red and white fabric feels familiar now, as natural as any other outfit you own. It’s not something you think about anymore. It’s just what you wear.\n\n \n\n *You...*\n\n \n \n <> \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

One second,” she tells them, before turning back to you.\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry. Busy day. Do you want to come around tonight, though?” she asks. “I'll cook something nice. We can catch-up!”\n\n \n\n You smile as Jennifer walks off to deal with the customer. \n\n Jennifer smiles at you when she sees you. “Hey!” she says, as she continues working. “This is a nice surprise.”\n\n \n\n “Just checking in,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n She grins, but her attention is drawn away by a customer coughing politely nearby. “Sorry ma’am. One second,” she tells them, before turning back to you.\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry. Busy day. But come around tonight?” she asks. “I’ll make it worth your while. I'll cook something nice.”\n\n \n\n You smile as Jennifer walks off to deal with the customer. \n\n “Oh hi Em,” Jennifer whispers as you approach. “What brings you to the store today?”\n\n \n\n “Just browsing,” you say, a little hesitant to say much in your current form. \n\n \n\n “You should take a look at the clothing department,” Jennifer replies. “There’s some new stock that just arrived.”\n\n \n\n You nod, looking over at the racks and mannequins on the other side of the store.\n\n \n\n “I’m really busy today, but I’ll see you soon, okay? And tell your sister to come round - I'd love to catch-up!\"\n \n “I’m really busy today, but I’ll see you soon, okay? And tell your brother I'm expecting him tonight.\"\n\n \n\n “Okay,” you mumble, not for the first time trying to make sense of the messy situation in your brain. You decide to leave Jennifer alone.\n\n “Hey Andrea,” Jennifer says as you approach. She looks you up and down, then leans in to whisper. \"Are you sure you should be walking around dressed like that? Doesn't Sermon mandate you don't wear your uniform outside?\"\n\n \n\n You feel a nervousness spreading inside your body at the words. \"I'm just on a break.\"\n\n \n\n Jennifer raises an eyebrow. \"If you say so.\"\n\n \n\n Her attention is drawn away by a customer coughing politely nearby. “Sorry ma’am. One second,” she tells them, before turning back to you.\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry. Busy day. But we should grab a coffee soon. And be careful walking around like that. You don't want Mr. Sermon to catch you.\"\n\n “Hey Flo,” Jennifer smiles as you approach. \"Taking a break from work?\"\n\n \n\n \"Something like that,\" you reply.\n\n \n\n “You should take a look at the clothing racks,” Jennifer replies. “There’s some new stock that just arrived. That yellow dress on display would really work with your hair.”\n\n \n\n You smile politely and glance over at the display. The yellow dress is strappy and casual. You could imagine wearing it on a summer day, your red locks swaying in a gentle wind.\n\n \n\n Don't you mean, you could imagine Florence wearing it?\n\n \n\n A customer coughs politely nearby, bringing you back to reality. Jennifer turns to apologise. “Sorry ma’am. One second.\"\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry,\" she then says to you. \"Busy day. But I'll come by Fresh Pot soon. We should catch-up.\"\n\n Jennifer eyes you cautiously as you approach. Only a twitch at the edge of her mouth hints of emotion. \"Can I help you?\"\n\n \n \n She stares back at you, meeting your eyes. For Jennifer, they look dead.\n\n \n\n When you don't reply, she lets out a little sigh. \"Look Annie. If you need something, go ask at the counter. I'm sure Maisie is around. Or should be. She'll be only too happy to help.\"\n\n \n\n \"Aren't you a shop assistant here too?\" you say, with a tone that you weren't expecting.\n\n \n\n Jennifer's eyes narrow, locking on to you. Her lips tighten. Then sighs. \"How can I help you?\"\n\n \n\n There is no sign of the joy or excitement you've grown accustomed to. Nor the mischievous smile. She instead looks deflated.\n\n \n\n \"It's okay,\" you whisper, then take a step back away from her. She watches you with confusion. You nod, then step back.\n\n Jennifer smiles professionally as you approach her. “Hello, welcome to Evans' Department Store. How can I help you?\"\n\n \n\n You return the smile, but unsure of what to say you tell her that you’re just browsing. \n\n \n\n She nods, retaining her professional expression. “If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask.” \n\n \n\n Jennifer returns to her work. You decide to leave her be for now.\n\nActions\n\n<>",

In spite of the hostile invitation, you decide to leave her alone.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n Christina looks up as you approach. “Oh hey, Em. Doing a little shopping?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “Something like that.”\n\n \n\n The cheerleader rolls her eyes just a little, but pulls out a white leather miniskirt from the clothing rack. “What do you think?” she asks you. “Sophisticated or slutty? I can’t decide.”\n\n \n\n You shrug, unsure what Emily would say, or what the right answer is. Christina laughs at your reaction.\n\n \n\n “Really, Em. We need to work on your sense of style.” Christina eyes you, appraisingly. “How would you like to do some retail therapy? I’m sure Daddy wouldn’t mind if we picked out some things for you. So. My treat.”\n\n \n\n You look back at Christina. Do you want to spend your time with her?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n Christina politely smiles as you approach. “Oh hi there,” she says, the sing-song tones in her voice just a little too forced.\n\n \n\n “Hey Christina,” you reply. “What are you doing?”\n\n \n\n “Browsing the new ranges,” she tells you. “My father might be the businessman of our house, but he has terrible taste. Mum picks out most of the stock.”\n\n \n\n She eyes you with her cold blue eyes, but turns her attention back to the clothing racks. “I’ll see you at school, then,” she adds, not looking back at you.\n\n \n\n Understanding an implied dismissal when you’ve received one, you say goodbye and step away, leaving her to shop.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n Christina looks up from the clothing racks as you approach. Her icy eyes look over you, a smile forming. “Jennifer,” she says. “Why aren’t you working? Or have you been slacking off again in the storeroom?”\n\n \n\n You glare back at her, trying to hold your head high. At this, she titters. “Oh, Jen. Let’s not pretend. It’s been years since you’ve frightened me. Don’t pretend that we don’t know who you are, now.”\n\n \n\n The resolve within your bones falters, as curiosity in her words takes the better of you. “And who’s that?”\n\n \n\n She offers you a polite smile, as false and fake as some of the brands in the department store. “A has-been,” she says, flatly. “Under all that bravado, you’re now just powerless and timid as the rest of them.”\n\n \n\n She gestures around to the other customers, unaware that they’ve just become Christina’s punctuation mark. “Run along, shop girl,” she adds. “Go serve.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n Christina glances up from the clothing racks as you approach. Her icy eyes look over you and a curious smile playing across her lips. “Hello Annie,” she says. “Looking for another dress? I believe there’s some more revealing outfits back in the discount section.”\n\n \n\n You look back at Christina, considering your response carefully. “I’m just browsing,” you tell her, unable to think of exactly what Annie would reply with.\n\n \n\n “I’m not surprised,” Christina says. “I would imagine that you don’t get paid well at a repair shop.” Her eyes glance up and down your body. “Although I’m sure Mr. Thompson is generous with his gifts. Shame he has a particular taste in clothes.”\n\n \n\n A flush of anger spreads across your frame. Her patronising smile infuriates you. For a brief moment, you’d like nothing more than to wipe it off her face.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n\n Christina looks up from the clothing racks as you approach.

Before you can reply Christina has stepped up towards you, close enough that her perfume overpowers your nostrils. \n\n \n\n “Did you realise that my father owns this store?\" she whispers. “And that I’m only eighteen?”\n\n \n\n A menacing smile creeps up her face. “Now. Get out of here, you little pervert. Don’t come back.”\n\n \n\n Without a second glance she turns and returns back to browsing the clothing racks, leaving you standing there dumbfounded.\n\n \n\n Not wanting to press the issue, you decide to leave the store.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "Christina motions toward the row of curtained-off changing cubicles, standing just outside with her arms crossed. “Go on, Em,” she instructs, tilting her head toward the nearest one.\n\n \n\n You hesitate for only a moment before stepping inside, pulling the curtain closed behind you. A breath of relief escapes as you realize Christina isn’t following. Even as Emily, the thought of undressing in front of her - especially here, in public - would be too much.\n\n \n\n Still, the reprieve is short-lived. The curtain rustles, and a sliver of Christina’s face appears at the side, peeking in. “Strip to your underwear,” she orders casually, as if it’s the most natural request in the world.\n\n \n\n You blink, caught off guard. “What?”\n\n \n\n Christina sighs, rolling her eyes. “Em, I have to see what we’re working with. Clothes should complement your natural shape. Now hurry up.”\n\n \n\n There’s no real room to argue. Exhaling slowly, you begin undressing, sliding out of your clothes until you’re left in just your underwear. The room suddenly feels cooler against your skin.\n\n \n\n When you mutter, “Done,” Christina doesn’t wait. With a swift motion, she pulls back the curtain, exposing you completely to her scrutinizing gaze. Her eyes flick up and down, appraising, as if she’s evaluating a dress on display. You shift uncomfortably under the intensity of it.\n\n \n\n “Like I thought,” she says at last, arms still folded. “You have some natural assets we can work with.”\n\n \n\n Before you can even process that, the door to the changing area opens.\n\n \n\n Jennifer steps in, holding a neat stack of clothes, and immediately freezes. Her eyes widen at the sight of you in just your underwear. “Oh,” she stammers, quickly averting her gaze. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to --”\n\n \n\n Christina dismisses her embarrassment with a wave. “Oh, don’t be such a prude, Jennifer. Just do your job and make sure no one else comes in here while we work. Understand?”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks up at her, grimacing as she bites her tongue. But nods.\n\n \n\n “I mean it.” Christina’s voice lowers, deliberate. “It would be a shame if I had to let daddy know I had a less than pleasant experience with the help. Especially after she was recommending his customers such... plain clothes.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer stiffens, as you look at the clothes Jennifer brought. Simple skirts, a cardigan, a plain white blouse. Nothing particularly bold. Exactly what Emily would usually wear.\n\n \n\n The disapproval from Christina is palpable. “Jennifer. Better choices. Find something that Emily could wear at home without hiding in shame. Now.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer doesn’t say anything this time. With a curt nod, she turns and disappears into the store again, off to find something more fitting for Christina’s standards. As soon as she’s gone, Christina turns back to you, expression calculating.\n\n \n\n “Here’s the real test, Em,” she says, gesturing to the discarded clothes. “This isn’t just about trying things on. It’s about asserting your standing.”\n\n \n\n She leans against the cubicle’s frame, arms crossed. “When that assistant brings back her selections, you’re going to judge them. Tell me what you really think of them. Don’t be shy. You need to prove you have an eye for style. That you can tell good taste from mediocrity.”\n\n \n \n Her lips curl into a smirk. “If you can’t, well… at least I’ll know how much work we still have to do on you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n The curtain sways slightly as Jennifer steps back into the changing area, a new stack of clothes in her arms. She sets them down carefully on the nearby bench, keeping her expression neutral. Forcing it to be neutral, like she’s bracing for something.\n\n \n\n Christina barely acknowledges her presence, already flipping through the selections. Her fingers trail over a soft beige sweater, a pair of pastel shorts, and a breezy floral dress.\n\n \n\n She exhales sharply. Disappointed.\n\n \n\n “Well, at least this is an improvement,” she muses, lifting a simple white sundress by its hanger. “But honestly? This entire selection looks like it was pulled from the end-of-the-line section.\"\n\n \n\n Jennifer says nothing, standing stiffly near the entrance. She meets your eyes. You can only look away.\n\n \n\n Christina tilts her head, then turns to you, curiosity gleaming in her blue eyes.\n\n \n\n “What do you think, Em?” she asks smoothly, stepping aside so you can look over the options yourself. “Has Jennifer done a good job?”\n\n \n\n You look over the selection. All you know is how you expect Christina to react. Any support for Jen will be seen as bad, any mockery good. Can you really do that to Jen, though?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n Jennifer soon steps back into the changing area, her posture still rigid as she carefully lays out a new selection of clothes. This time, she doesn’t even glance at you. Whatever frustration she’s feeling, she keeps it tightly bottled.\n\n \n\n Christina hums in approval as she lifts up a pale pink dress, twirling it slightly by the hanger. A full skirt with layers of soft petticoats, cinched at the waist with a delicate white belt. Short puffed sleeves, lace trim, and tiny pearl buttons running down the front give it a dainty, doll-like charm. The rest of the selection follows the same style. Girlish. Pristine. Perfectly suited for the Kaplars’ country club.\n\n \n\n Christina’s grin sharpens as she inspects the pieces.\n\n \n\n “This is more like it,” she muses, brushing a hand over the starched fabric of the blouse. “Something fitting for a Charlton girl.”\n\n \n\n Then her gaze flicks to you. “Well, Em? What do you think? Did Jennifer finally get it right? Do you want to try it on?”\n\n \n\n You hesitate. Everything about these outfits is deliberate. The soft, pastel colors. The cinched waist. The subtle yet undeniable femininity woven into each thread. It’s the ideal of a young Charlton woman.\n\n \n\n And yet, you can’t imagine yourself wearing any of it. Jennifer, standing by the door, finally risks a glance at you. Her expression is carefully neutral, but her fingers tighten slightly against her forearm.\n\n \n\n Christina, meanwhile, is waiting.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n The click of Jennifer’s heels echoes through the changing area as she re-enters, carrying an armful of daring, body-hugging outfits. She says nothing this time, simply setting the clothes down with a measured, professional air, as if forcing herself to act like this is just another task.\n\n \n\n Christina barely acknowledges her, already plucking a dress from the pile. It’s a slim, black number, with a plunging neckline, hugging every curve with precision. The other options follow a similar theme. Low-cut blouses, skirts that barely graze mid-thigh, tight-fitting sweaters that leave little to the imagination.\n\n \n\n The second you take in the selection, something clicks in your mind. If you saw a girl wearing these on a date… \n\n \n\n Your thoughts drift before you can stop them. A mental image flashes. You at a dimly lit movie theater, sitting beside a girl dressed like this, her perfume lingering in the air, her fingers brushing against yours in the shared popcorn bucket.\n\n \n\n You swallow, blinking. Except… The image shifts. Suddenly, it’s not just the girl beside you. It’s you.\n\n \n\n You are the one in the outfit. You are the one being admired. The soft glow of the theater lights catches the curve of your legs, the shimmer of lipstick on your lips. You’re laughing, leaning just slightly into the broad shoulder of the boy next to you. A football player. Tall. Confident. Chiseled. Strong. You can almost hear his voice in your ear, feel the weight of his hand resting on your thigh. A sudden rush of something coils deep in your stomach. Excitement, maybe, or confusion.\n\n \n\n Christina, oblivious to your sudden spiral, clicks her tongue. “Well, Jennifer,” she says, drawing out the name, her smile sharp as ever. “This is certainly… bold.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer doesn’t react, though you swear you see the way her fingers twitch at her sides.\n\n \n\n Christina turns to you, lifting a silky, wine-red dress with thin straps and a dangerously short hem. “What do you think, Em?” she muses, voice carefully leading. “Think you could pull this off?”\n\n \n\n Her expression is unreadable, but the slight raise of her brow says everything. She's waiting to see if you'll go along with Jennifer, or deliver a deathblow.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n\n You change back into your normal clothes, the fabric feeling strangely neutral after the extravagant outfits you’ve seen. Taking a final glance at yourself in the mirror, you exhale and step out of the cubicle, joining Christina in the changing room lobby.\n\n \n\n She’s already waiting, casually inspecting her nails, as if the entire experience had been more of a test than a shopping trip.\n\n \n\n \n Christina’s smile is slow, deliberate as she looks you over. There’s something different in her gaze now. Approval.\n\n \n\n “Well, well,” she muses, clearly pleased. “I think you’re starting to understand how things work around here.”\n\n \n\n She steps closer, lowering her voice slightly.\n\n \n\n “There’s a pecking order at Charlton,” she continues smoothly. “Cheerleaders and jocks at the top. Nerds and outcasts at the bottom. I want to see you at the top of the food chain. And you? You’re learning exactly where you belong.”\n\n <>\n \n\n She pauses, then smirks, tilting her head. “You handled Jennifer beautifully. That girl needed reminding of her place.”\n\n \n\n Christina doesn’t wait for a response, instead linking arms with you effortlessly, guiding you out of the changing area and back into the store.\n\n \n\n As you walk past the counters, you feel the weight of Jennifer’s glare. It’s not subtle. Her fingers are tight around a neatly folded sweater, her eyes following your every step as you and Christina stride toward the exit.\n\n \n\n Your stomach tightens. But you don’t look back.\n\n \n\n At the door, Christina slows, turning toward you. “I mean it, Emily,” she purrs, eyes gleaming with mischief. “Prove you belong on the squad. When you have, come see me at practice.”\n\n \n\n With that, she steps through the glass doors and disappears onto Orchid Road, leaving you standing just inside the store.\n\n \n\n You don't dare look behind you. You know that in doing so, you'd have to meet Jennifer's eyes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Christina studies you for a moment, then lets out a soft hum of consideration.\n\n \n\n “You’ve got a way to go,” she finally says, not unkindly, but there’s still an edge of expectation in her voice.\n\n \n\n “There’s a pecking order at Charlton,” she continues, as if reminding you. “Cheerleaders and jocks at the top. Nerds and outcasts at the bottom. I want to see you at the top of the food chain. And I can help you get there.”\n\n <>\n \n\n She flashes you a knowing smile, almost conspiratorial. “Stick with me, Em. You’ll learn.”\n\n \n\n With that, she guides you out of the changing area and back through the store. Jennifer is still at her post, carefully folding clothes. This time, she’s watching. Not glaring. Not angry. Just… confused. Like she’s trying to figure out what she just witnessed.\n\n \n\n You don’t meet her eyes, but you can feel her stare following you as you and Christina head for the exit.\n\n \n\n At the door, Christina pauses, turning toward you. “I mean it, Emily,” she purrs, voice still sickly sweet. “Prove you belong on the squad. When you have, come see me at practice.”\n\n \n\n With that, she steps outside, leaving you standing at the threshold. Wondering if you should turn back to speak to Jennifer.\n\n \n\n But you can't even begin to formulate what to say.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Evans' Department Store - Staff Room**\n\n [image: ./images/Evans_Department_Store_Staff_Room.png]\n\n \n\n Your heart thrums with a dull mix of dread and resignation as you push open the “Staff Only” door, stepping into the dimly lit back halls of Evans’. You walk quickly and quietly, certain that somebody is going to call you out for entering a private area, not open to the public.\n\n \n\n With some trepidation you move through the endless corridors. You pass a cleaner, polishing the floor. A lone electrician, fiddling with a fuse box. Two other sales assistants that you don’t recognise. \n\n \n\n No one treats you as though you shouldn’t be there. Nobody stops you. Nobody questions you. Instead, they barely acknowledge you.\n\n \n\n In the cramped staff room, the bulletin board groans under the weight of today’s roster. Names scrawled in bright marker mock you:\n \n \n\n “Stock control - Jenna! The early zest gets the dress!” \n \n\n A sigh escapes you. In the grand scheme of retail, inventory is the dullest rung on the ladder.\n\n \n\n You punch the time clock and steel yourself for a morning of dusty boxes and misplaced price tags. Does Jennifer really do this every day?\n \n \n **Evans' Department Store - Staff Room**\n\n [image: ./images/Evans_Department_Store_Staff_Room.png]\n\n \n\n You push open the Staff Only door and walk the back corridors of the department store, this time without the anxiety of being an imposter. In some ways the reality is worse. Despite working in the same store, people go out of their way to avoid acknowledging you.\n\n \n\n Entering the staff room, you check the schedule. Once again, you’ve been assigned to the stock room in the morning. You take a breath, then turn on your heels and walk out.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n **Evans' Department Store - Staff Room**\n\n [image: ./images/Evans_Department_Store_Staff_Room.png]\n\n \n\n You enter the staff room again. It’s lunchtime, but the room is empty. The kettle is cold. You’d bet if you checked the fridge, there wouldn't be any food in there. As far as you can tell, no one eats at Evans' department store.\n\n \n\n You check the board and see the same bright scrawl against lunchtime:\n\n \n\n “Perfume counter: Jenna / Maisie. Two noses are better than one!” \n \n\n Your stomach grumbles, but you walk out the door.\n\n \n **Evans' Department Store - Staff Room**\n\n [image: ./images/Evans_Department_Store_Staff_Room.png]\n\n \n\n You briskly enter the staff room, glancing at the schedule. Again, Jenna and Maisie, assigned to the perfume counter at lunchtime. Nothing ever seems to change around here.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n **Evans' Department Store - Staff Room**\n\n [image: ./images/Evans_Department_Store_Staff_Room.png]\n\n \n\n You crack open the staff room door, the fluorescent buzz and stale coffee scent washing over you. At the battered corkboard the afternoon roster is pinned in bright marker:\n \n \n\n “Sales counter: Jenna. Dress them to impress them!” \n \n\n Taking a deep breath, you open the door to the staff room and once more walk to the shop floor.\n\n \n **Evans' Department Store - Staff Room**\n\n [image: ./images/Evans_Department_Store_Staff_Room.png]\n\n \n\n You slip into the staff room again and glance at the schedule: Still assigned to the sales desk. You let out a quiet sigh and step back out.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n **Evans' Department Store - Staff Room**\n\n [image: ./images/Evans_Department_Store_Staff_Room.png]\n\n \n\n \n \n You slip into the deserted staff room, legs aching from hours spent balancing perfect poise, enthusiastic smiles and cheerful demeanor. Your mind hums with the echo of compliments you never meant.\n\n \n\n With a soft sigh, you pull on your coat and push open the door. Another shift over. Another day of being the reflection of everyone else’s desires. You wonder how Jennifer copes with this without losing herself. And how many shifts you can do without it happening to you.\n\n \n\n Then you remember what Jennifer asked of you. *Pick something nice to wear. For in there,* You gulp. You know exactly what she means.\n\n \n\n You’re not seriously considering this, are you?\n\n \n\n You stop before exiting, debating what you’re going to do.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n \n You slip into the deserted staff room, legs aching from hours spent balancing perfect poise, enthusiastic smiles and cheerful demeanor.

Another day of being the reflection of everyone else’s desires. You wonder how Jennifer copes with this without losing herself. And how many shifts you can do without it happening to you.\n\n \n \n As you consider Jennifer, something bubbles up in your brain. Her offer for you to stay over when you last were her. And her lack of interest in you staying the night when you transformed back.\n\n \n\n Almost like a worm burrowing up inside you, an unsettling idea forms in your mind. Maybe she wanted to... experiment?\n\n \n\n You’re not seriously considering this, are you?\n\n \n\n You stop before exiting, debating what you’re going to do.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n You slip into the deserted staff room, legs aching from hours spent balancing perfect poise, enthusiastic smiles and cheerful demeanor.

    "text": "“You see,” he begins, and you instantly know there’s a wave of bullshit coming your way. “The loading bay has been blocked by someone’s new car. These rich folk, think they own this town, don’t they? I can’t get my van in there.” He looks down at your body once again. “It’s too tight to fit in.”\n\n \n\n You fold your arms. “Then park on the double yellows and deliver,” you fire back.\n\n \n\n Martin’s lips twitch into a grin. He steps forward and you find yourself backing up, brushing against the unopened crate next to the door. “And risk a fine?” he says. “Fifty quid for a few boxes of ladies’ underwear? Not worth it.” His voice dips low, rough as gravel. “Council don’t care if I’m late, but they love writing tickets.”\n\n \n\n You let out a huff. “That’s not my problem. You’re paid to deliver.”\n\n \n\n He straightens, expression twisting into something almost like pity. “Funny,” he says, voice thick with mock regret, “I heard about you.” He leans in, boots scraping the concrete as he shifts his weight. “Big fall from grace, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n His hand drifts to the crate behind you, pressing just enough to pin you there. “Makes me wonder,” he murmurs, eyes dark. “How far you’ll go to stay on top… even just in this shop?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [The Appeaser] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n [The Appeaser] <> - You can't seem to stand up for yourself\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You can’t help it. Before you even think, the words spill out of your mouth. “Alright, Martin. What is it you want?”\n\n \n\n His grin turns predatory. “Something I’ve been hoping for all morning. Just a kiss.” \n\n \n\n He looks at you. You feel like you don’t have a choice. Not with him. You can only nod.\n\n \n\n Before you can react, he sweeps you up on the crate. Your skirt rides up as he settles you down, his eyes now on the same level as yours. He pushes forward, parting your legs, skirt now up around your waist.\n\n \n\n He leans in close, voice low. “Just a little one. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.”\n\n \n\n His lips crash against yours - stubbly and rough - with the acrid tang of cigarette smoke and last night’s whiskey. You don’t pull away. Instead, you close your eyes, letting him guide the kiss. His tongue teases past your lips, and a hand slides under your blouse at the small of your back, the other curling around your exposed thigh.\n\n \n\n There is a tingle in your body. The taste of Martin is abhorrent. Logically, you are repulsed by him. But after spending hours doing mindless work, something flutters inside of you. You recognise it as an emotion. At least you're feeling something.\n\n \n\n Despite everything telling you that this is wrong, you find yourself responding. Longing for a feeling that isn't brain-numbing. The smell of alcohol and cigarettes more valuable to you than any control you have.\n\n \n\n After what feels like a heartbeat stretched into an eternity, he steps back. You catch your breath as he straightens, dust motes drifting through the fluorescent glare. His dark eyes flick over you appreciatively.\n\n \n\n “Expected nothing less from Charlton’s top student,” he murmurs, voice thick with mock admiration. \"Read about you in some articles in the Charlton Gazette. You were going to be something. Now, look at you.”\n\n \n\n He reaches for the door, pauses, and looks back. “But now school’s over. You're just like me. I suppose this will be the highlight of your day.”\n\n \n\n With a final crooked smile, he slips out, the door thudding shut behind him. You hear the van’s engine roar to life, then the shuffle of boxes being unloaded.\n\n \n\n You press your hand to your racing heart and adjust your clothing, then shift off the crate. Something inside you stopped you from doing anything he wanted. But the troubling thought on your mind is the sensation - the actual feeling - you experienced was as rare in this work as the disgust you feel from appeasing him.\n\n \n\n Not for the first time, you wonder how Jennifer manages to get through an entire day.\n\n <>\n \n \n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n Take a break - *You feel compelled to work throughout today as Jennifer told you to*\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You sigh. “Alright, Martin.

His tongue teases past your lips, and a hand slides under your blouse at the small of your back, the other curling around your exposed thigh.\n\n \n\n You grow still, focusing all your efforts on not throwing up. The taste of Martin is abhorrent. There is nothing in the world you’d want to do less.\n\n \n\n After what feels like a heartbeat stretched into an eternity, he steps back. You look away as he straightens, dust motes drifting through the fluorescent glare. His dark eyes flick over you with disappointment.\n\n \n\n “Not feeling it today?” he murmurs, almost annoyed. “Don’t worry, you’ll learn your place soon enough. From where I’m standing, it looks like you’re not so different to me.”\n\n \n\n He steps back, loosening his grip. His gaze lingers as he sneers, “Yup. Here you are. A sales assistant hiding in the stockroom with the delivery man. Remember that. When you finally accept where you are, I’ll be waiting.”\n\n \n\n He pivots and strides out, leaving the door swinging and your pulse pounding in the sudden silence.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n Take a break - *You feel compelled to work throughout today as Jennifer told you to*\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You straighten your shoulders and meet his glare. “Fine,” you say, voice steady. “I’ll just tell Mr. Evans you refused to deliver.”\n\n \n\n His broad frame surges forward, and before you can step back, you’re pinned against the wooden crate. He leans close, voice low and dangerous. “You wouldn’t do that if you were me.” He doesn’t make a move, but his eyes roam up and down your uniform.\n\n \n\n He snorts. “Terry Evans knows me. Went to school with him. He’ll listen to my word over some lowly shop girl.”\n\n \n\n Your chest tightens, but deep within you find a wave of defiance. “He’ll listen to me more than a drunk delivery driver who never did a damned thing with his life. You went to school with Terry Evans. Now he owns this place. What have you ever achieved?”\n\n \n\n For a heartbeat, you see raw fury flare in Martin’s eyes. Then he smirks, dragging his tongue across his teeth. “Careful, Chambers,” he murmurs. “From where I’m standing, you don’t look any different to me.”\n\n \n\n “I remember you,” he continues. “Charlton’s golden girl. Read about you in some articles in the Charlton Gazette. You were going to be something. Now, look at you.”\n \n \n\n He steps back, loosening his grip. His gaze lingers as he sneers, “You might’ve been the top cat at school, but here you are. A sales assistant hiding in the stockroom with the delivery man. Remember that.

From where I’m standing, it looks like you’re not so different to me.”\n\n \n \n He steps back, loosening his grip. His gaze lingers as he sneers, “Yup. Here you are. A sales assistant hiding in the stockroom with the delivery man. Remember that.

Every bright detail underscoring the forced cheer of Jennifer’s daily grind.\n\n \n\n \n \n You approach the perfume counter. A glass-topped display cabinet gleams under soft lighting, lined with frosted crystal bottles and gilt-trimmed atomizers. The air is thick with floral powder, citrus zest, and something with a sickly sweet undertone that lingers longer than expected.\n\n \n\n Behind the counter, a poised assistant in a peach blouse and pencil skirt offers quiet suggestions with a practiced smile. Maisie Peterson.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Maisie is already behind the counter. She smiles politely at you as you approach. “Am I late again?” you ask, rushing around the counter.\n\n \n\n \n \n She smiles, as if sharing a secret. “It’s fine. I just got in myself. It feels wrong to be cooped up in here at the weekends. I wanted to spend longer at the country club.”\n\n \n\n \"You wouldn't believe what Hazel Evans was saying to that lifeguard, Ethan,\" Maisie whispers. \"He's young enough to be her son. She thinks she can get away with it, being married to a town statesman.\"\n\n \n She smiles, as if sharing a secret. “It’s fine. I just got in myself. The school receptionist wouldn’t believe that Stitch had signed my pass. As if I’d bother to forge it to come here.”\n\n \n\n Her smile creeps up on the left hand side of her face, as she lowers her voice. “Making other people miserable is probably the only joy she gets in life. It’s not as if she’ll marry well, stuck in that school.”\n\n \n \n\n You smile politely, thoughts briefly considering that Jennifer has to listen to this everyday. This idle bitching and gossiping being the only thing to break up the mundane job of working in a quiet store. \n\n \n\n Maisie suddenly stops her chatter mid-sentence. Eyes widening. You know what’s coming. “Darling!”\n\n \n\n You turn to see Aunt Joan approaching the perfume counter, heels clacking. At seeing Maisie, she pauses. Eyes narrowed.\n\n \n\n “My dear, what on earth is that?” she snaps, jerking a finger at Maisie’s uniform blouse. “That silk looks like your mother draped a napkin over you. And that skirt’s hemline like it’s been dragged along by a cart.”\n\n \n\n She straightens, lips pursing. “I need a new dress. Something that actually flatters a woman of good stock. I have a function this evening full of eligible bachelors. Come along. You can model for me. And leave your mother’s tawdry tastes at the counter, god help her. Lord knows she at least tries.”\n\n \n\n Maisie’s eyes again flick to you for help.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [All Dolled Up] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You walk towards the perfume counter, seeing a young woman with finely detailed make-up and porcelain skin already standing behind it. She greets you with a practiced smile. \n\n \n\n “Am I running late?”, you ask, as you slide in.\n\n \n\n Maisie leans in, voice dropping to a whisper. “A bit, but don’t worry. It’s been dead. Just Hazel Evans and Jeanette Thompson spritzing themselves before lunch.” She smirks. “Covering up this morning’s tennis lessons. I’m surprised they sweat at all with all the nattering they do.”\n\n \n\n A customer walks by, causing Maisie to shift quickly to stand up straight and face the counter. You do the same. But they pass by, uninterested in talking to you or browsing the counter.\n\n \n\n Maisie sighs after they’ve rounded a corner. “This is more boring than lessons. At least at school I don’t have to pretend to be interested.”\n\n \n\n You arch an eyebrow. “You go to Charlton?”\n\n \n\n Her smile tightens. She tilts her head, as if you’ve forgotten a fact. “You know I do. Just get the afternoons off sometimes to work here. As well as weekends. Work experience, apparently. Like I want to work when I graduate. That’s what marriage is for.”\n\n \n\n “How did you manage to get permission for that?” you press.\n\n \n\n She glances around, her smile returning. She reaches beneath the counter, rummages in a handbag, and produces a stiff cardboard pass stamped with Stitch’s scrawled signature. “Daddy pulled a few strings,” she says, shrugging. “Special privileges for cheerleaders, high achievers… and those in the know. Didn’t they do the same when you were at Charlton? Or was it different back then?”\n\n \n\n Maisie’s eyebrow lifts slightly. In spite of the words, you can see no ill intent. She continues, blissfully ignorant of any offense she might have caused. “Speaking of school…wasn’t Steve Duncan in your year? Mayor’s son? Off at uni now, I think. Good family. Well off. He was cute, too.”\n\n \n\n Her incessant chatter suddenly trails off, as her eyes catch something behind you. Turning your head to look over your shoulder, you see an aging woman in a white cashmere coat striding towards the counter, heels clicking across the tiles like a judge’s gavel.\n \n <>\n \n\n “Oh no. Aunt Joan,” Maisie hisses, cheeks paling.\n\n \n\n “Darling!” Aunt Joan purrs, sweeping past you without so much as a glance. “She’s still not engaged? I told your mother, what’s the point of good posture if no one’s proposing?”\n\n \n\n You look at the woman. She is wearing a garish floral dress that clashes rather than complements, her makeup layered on with theatrical excess. Clearly someone who believes boldness is beauty, even when it tips into overkill.\n\n \n\n Maisie looks like she wants the floor to swallow her up.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “My dear,” Joan says, appraising Maisie. “That blouse hangs like a sack. And your hair? Where's the polish? It looks like you tried and gave up halfway.”\n\n \n\n You see a flash of irritation cross Maisie’s face, but Joan shows no signs of caring. “And this,” she points to Maisie’s cheek. “This isn’t makeup, it’s a single wash of paste. You really do take after your mother in style. Thank god she married into old money. Heaven knows how she would have got by otherwise. But you can’t count on having her luck.”\n\n \n\n Maisie takes a deep breath and her practiced smile returns. “How can I help you today, Aunt Joan?”\n\n \n\n “I need something modern and timeless,” she continues, voice softening into faux regret. “Refined and bold. I need to pop, but not stand-out. I have a dinner party at the Hudson’s farm. Meeting their boy’s fiance. She’s not that much older than you, Maisie. Think of the generational wealth you could have married into if you’d snagged his attention?”\n\n \n\n “I think there’s some dresses in the new range section that would suit you,” Maisie tries, her voice nervous. \n\n \n\n Joan sighs, rolling her eyes. \"Really, Maisie, that isn’t becoming of an Evans' sales girl. Come and show me.”\n\n \n\n “In fact,” she adds, her eyes looking Maisie up and down. “Why don’t you model them for me. It would do you the world of good wearing something sophisticated. Leave those gutter-girl belts and strapless tops behind for once. And you and I are practically the same size.”\n\n \n\n You look between Maisie and her Aunt. They most certainly aren't.\n\n \n\n “You never know”, Joan continues. “I might find someone to step on the grave of your dear old Uncle Ernest. Maybe they’ll have a son or cousin your age I could introduce you to. Get you out of this shop girl future you seem to be drifting towards.”\n\n \n\n Maisie’s eyes flick to you, pleading.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [All Dolled Up] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You cut in between Maisie and Aunt Joan, voice confident. “I know exactly what you need. Something that flatters without shouting. That jade-green wrap dress at the new arrivals will hug your waist and fall elegantly over your shoulders.” \n\n \n\n Joan’s eyes turn from Maisie to look directly at you. You see her thinking before she nods. “That does sound promising. Very well. Lead the way.”\n\n \n\n You step forward and, without hesitation, guide her to the new-arrivals rack. Fingers brushing the satin finish of a midnight-blue sheath dress trimmed in subtle gold, you sense its bold elegance will suit her perfectly.\n\n \n\n “How about this,” you murmur, passing her the dress and a delicate pearl choker. “The colour will bring out your eyes, and the neckline is just the right balance of refined and daring.”\n\n \n\n Joan’s eyes flick to the rack and light up. “Oh, very chic,” she exclaims. \n\n \n\n “Would you like me to model it for you?” you ask, before adding a lie. “We’re almost the same size.” \n\n \n\n Joan shakes her head, already slipping the dress from the hanger. “No need. I’ll see for myself,” she says, disappearing into the fitting room with a satisfied smile.\n\n \n\n Five minutes later she emerges, the dress clinging beautifully. She smooths the fabric, beaming. “My dear,” Aunt Joan breathes, voice warmed with genuine delight. “You’ve outdone yourself. Pardon me, I didn’t catch your name?”\n\n \n\n You offer her a polite smile. “Jennifer,” you say. How easily you responded to that question with that name.\n\n \n\n “Thank you, Jennifer,” Joan replies. You steer her toward the sales desk and process the transaction. She clutches your hand in thanks. “Maisie could learn plenty from you,” she adds with a wink. “Heaven forbid she inherits her mother’s dreadful taste in friends.”\n\n \n\n Something inside you flutters. A spark of a feeling, its presence all the more powerful against the flat state you only now realise you’ve been existing in since working on the perfume counter. It feels wrong, but being recognised for something - even if it is your fashion sense - feels like a reward.\n\n \n\n When Joan leaves, you return to the perfume counter. Maisie lets out a soft laugh. “Thank you,” she whispers. “She went to school with half of Charlton, thinks it makes her an oracle. Mary Handle this, Mary that.”\n\n \n \n \n\n A chill passes up your spine. “Mary who?”\n\n \n\n “Handle. She’s Evans' receptionist. Works upstairs. I think she’s in today. I saw her come back from lunch just as I was coming in.”\n\n \n\n Mary Handle. Terrence’s mother. Coincidence? You should find a way to go up and talk to her.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n Take a break - *You feel compelled to work throughout today as Jennifer told you to*\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You inject yourself into the conversation with a smile. “Men at functions like that are drawn by the mystery and hint of desire. Something sheer that react to the light. Something that makes them question how much they can see. And something to make them consider what it would be like to see what’s underneath.”\n\n \n\n Upon hearing the words, Maisie looks at you with fear, tensing up. Joan’s eyes focus away from her and on to you. The older woman appraises you without emotion.\n\n \n\n Then, after a moment, she smiles. “That sounds ideal,” she says. “Could you excuse yourself from the counter, my dear? I think your opinion would be invaluable.\"\n\n \n\n You step forward and guide her to the new-arrivals rack. As you walk, you wonder how you are going to talk to Joan about fashion. But you do know what appeals to guys. You clutch on to that knowledge like your life depends on it.\n\n \n\n “See how the light kisses the fabric here?”, you say, pointing to a dove-grey sheath with a subtle shimmer. “It hints at the curves beneath without baring too much. It’s far more alluring than anything overt.”\n\n \n\n Joan’s eyes brighten. “Show me more,” she urges. You lift a charcoal wrap dress next. You’ve seen women wearing them back in the city. You know what reaction they get. “This neckline grazes the collarbone just so, drawing the eye upward. And the slight sway at the hem keeps the silhouette dignified, yet suggestive.”\n\n \n\n The words sound foreign to you as you say them, but you can’t help but feel there’s an underlying truth to all your waffle. You know what boys like.\n\n \n\n Joan slips each into the fitting room in turn, returning for your quiet appraisal. Finally, she settles on the dove-grey sheath. You steer her to the sales desk. She clasps your hand, smiling. “Thank you. Jennifer, isn’t it? I hope Maisie learns the art of subtlety from you. Lord knows, her mother always thought graceful meant hiding every hint of skin.”\n\n \n\n Something inside you flutters. A spark of a feeling, its presence all the more powerful against the flat state you only now realise you’ve been existing in since working on the perfume counter. It feels wrong, but being recognised for something - even if it's how to attract boys - feels like a reward.\n\n \n\n When Joan leaves, you return to the perfume counter. Maisie lets out a soft laugh. “Thank you,” she whispers. “She went to school with half of Charlton, thinks it makes her an oracle. Mary Handle this, Mary that.”\n\n \n \n \n\n A chill passes up your spine. “Mary who?”\n\n \n\n “Handle. She’s Evans' receptionist. Works upstairs. I think she’s in today. I saw her come back from lunch just as I was coming in.”\n\n \n\n Mary Handle. Terrence’s mother. Coincidence? You should find a way to go up and talk to her.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <> \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n Take a break - *You feel compelled to work throughout today as Jennifer told you to*\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You cut in, voice bright. “I’m sure the guys at the event would be captivated by a daring hemline. Just a flash a bit of thigh. Maybe a plunging neckline that promises more. I could help you look for something that would appeal to them.”\n\n \n\n You sense Maisie stiffen next to you as Joan’s eyes widen in incredulity. “My dear, these are gentlemen, not schoolboys chasing stockings. They prize subtlety and poise, not scandalous flashes of flesh.”\n\n \n\n A sigh escapes her, rich with disappointment. “If this is how the young girls of today think they should act, I fear for the Empire’s future.” She glances at Maisie. “It’s almost like your mother was a sign of things to come.”\n\n \n\n Maisie winces at her words. Joan stands there, looking at her niece with expectation.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You clear your throat. “Maisie’s tied up at the counter, but I’d be happy to help you find something.”\n\n \n\n She appraises you from head to toe. “Very well,” she nods. “Your hips actually look more like mine anyway. Poor dear,” she adds, glancing at Maisie. “She’s inherited her mother’s waistline.”\n\n \n\n With a decisive snap, she steers you toward the ladies’ fashion section. Before you can protest, she’s pulling dresses off the rail - bold florals, sleek sheaths, whisper-thin chiffons - and drapes them over your shoulders. “Try that one too,” she commands, pointing to a fitted bodice and full skirt.\n\n \n\n In the changing room, you emerge in outfit after outfit: a bodycon midi that clings to every curve, a tea-length frock with a cinched waist, an off-the-shoulder slip that grazes your collarbone. After each reveal, Aunt Joan circles you, offering clipped observations.\n\n \n\n “Lift your chin. Yes, like that. The neckline flatters your collarbone.” “A smidge higher on the waist, there. Now it emphasizes your hourglass.” “That sash needs tightening. See how it tames the hips?”\n\n \n\n At first, you fumble with unfamiliar hems and straps, cheeks burning under her steely gaze. But when she smooths a fold at your waist and murmurs, “Divine on you,” a warmth spreads through your chest. You find yourself holding still to let her admire the fabric’s fall. A quiet thrill at her approval.\n\n \n\n By the final dress you know exactly where to cinch the sash and how to angle your shoulder. Aunt Joan’s lips curve into a rare smile. “Perfect, darling.” She steps back, satisfied. “It looks lovely on you. So I’m sure it will look spectacular on me.”\n\n \n\n You retreat to the dressing room and slip out of the last dress, feeling a flutter tickles your ribs. Modeling dresses for an hour felt… rewarding. A live mannequin, posed by Aunt Joan. You smile as you reflect on her compliments on your figure. You realise that this is the most you’ve felt since working on the perfume counter. \n\n \n\n That realization sends an unexpected shiver through you.\n\n \n\n Returning to the shop floor, you lead Joan to the sales desk. She smiles and pays before leaving the store. When you return to the perfume counter. Maisie lets out a soft laugh. “Thank you,” she whispers. “She went to school with half of Charlton, thinks it makes her an oracle. Mary Handle this, Mary that.”\n\n \n \n \n\n A chill passes up your spine. “Mary who?”\n\n \n\n “Handle. She’s Evans' receptionist. Works upstairs. I think she’s in today. I saw her come back from lunch just as I was coming in.”\n\n \n\n Mary Handle. Terrence’s mother. Coincidence? You should find a way to go up and talk to her.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n Take a break - *You feel compelled to work throughout today as Jennifer told you to*\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You offer a polite nod, but let Maisie handle Aunt Joan herself. The sales assistant sighs. “Alright Aunt Joan, lead the way.”\n\n \n\n Maisie slips out from behind the counter, leaving you alone. With nothing better to do, you settle behind the perfume counter and resume the drudgery. Before you know it, an hour has slipped past. Customers barely approach you and when they do, they ask the same questions. You quickly learn which customers expect you to prefer floral to citrus, or respond enthusiastically when someone uses one of the test bottles.\n\n \n\n Each interruption is as dull as the last: a pregnant mum worried about fragrance strength, a bored bank clerk who “just needs a spritz.” You catch yourself humming under your breath as you decant testers, the mechanical rhythm lulling you into a half-dream. No thought required. Just the memory of a few key phrases and the confidence to sound like you belong.\n\n \n\n Your mind drifts back to Jennifer. That this is her life. Day in, day out. You can’t imagine how it feels to be this bored at work. And for the first time, you realise how flat you feel in doing this job.\n\n \n\n When Maisie finally returns, she looks as if she’s lost five rounds in the ring. Her shoulders slump and her smile has vanished. You rise and ask softly, “How did it go?”\n\n \n\n She sighs, cheeks drained of colour. “Just the same old lecture about my mother’s many flaws,” she murmurs. She straightens her blouse and slips back into her routine, offering no more than a small nod. Clearly, Aunt Joan has taken every drop of her energy, leaving nothing but silence in its wake.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n\n \n \n Take a break - *You feel compelled to work throughout today as Jennifer told you to*\n\n \n <>\n \n \n\n **Evans' Department Store - Sales Desk**\n\n [image: ./images/Evans_Department_Store_Sales_Desk.png]\n\n \nA hexagonal sales counter topped with clunky cash registers and gaudy pin-up posters, ringed by blank-faced mannequins and endless rails of drab dresses.\n\n \n\n \n \n You step behind the counter and feel instantly on display. The glare of fluorescent lights seem to be directed at the counter, whilst the shape of the counter gives people a view of you almost from every angle. Like the counter is a podium and the customers are your audience.\n\n \n\n Forcing a smile, you step up to the till. They are archaic, but you see the basics are the same as a string of part-time jobs you did at uni. But customer questions are a different matter. After a few honest truths to some unhappy customers, you force a bright smile and a cheerful tone in your voice. The reactions are instant and pleasant.\n\n \n\n The monotony of it dulls your mind. You find yourself dropping into a rhythm. The ancient tills clatter at your fingertips like props. The drawers ding like an ending to a song. As you serve, you complement your smiles and cheery tone with graceful movements. Every movement is choreographed: a hand on your hip here, a tilt of the head there, each flourish theatrical. This is a stage that you find yourself performing a role on.\n\n \n\n Your words are similarly refined as you go. Women lean in, nodding at your praise of their choices; men hover at the edge of the desk, smirking when you catch their eye. There is no honesty needed here. You realise quickly that you are a bright, cheerful carnival mirror, designed to reflect the best versions of your customers.\n \n \n \nAnd all the while, at the back of your mind you distantly remember that you need to get away from the desk and sneak upstairs to see Mary. Your eyes periodically flick up to a clock and you grimace as time ticks by. But the drum and monotony of the tasks of a sales girl keep stacking up, and you struggle to break the brain-numbing performance that you all-too easily slip into.\n\n \n\n The act becomes so overbearing that it takes you a number of attempts to recognise your own name. “Jennifer!”\n\n \n\n Except that’s not your name, is it?\n\n \n\n Before you can give it much thought, your heart sinks when you see the source of the voice. Grinning back at you from over the counter is Christina.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You take up position behind one of the counters, it all feeling familiar to you now. You bustle around the counter with a bounce and enthusiasm, keep your voice a pitch higher than normal, and above all, smile. It still feels like a stage, but you’re growing used to being both the centre of attention and an empty vessel, letting your mind slip away as you parrot back compliments and smile at leering men.\n \n \n \n \nStill, all the while, looking for a moment to get upstairs to see Mary. But the queues seem to appear just as you think you have caught a break.\n\n \n \n\n Just like clockwork though, as you say goodbye to the last customer currently at the desk, Christina appears from behind a clothing rack. “Oh hello, Jennifer! Can you possibly do me an awful favour? I need to find a new outfit that won’t look unseemly at Daddy’s croquet afternoon.”\n\n \n \nYou glance up at the clock. If you’re going to catch Mary before she leaves for the day, you’re going to have to get rid of Christina. Fast.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n\n “Store’s awfully quiet today,” Christina mentions. “Scaring customers off with that… intensity of yours?” She lets the word hang, as if daring you to challenge it. “Maybe I should mention it to daddy,” she adds, trying to taunt you.\n\n \n\n When you don’t reply, she smiles. “Oh Jennifer, just relax. It’s just a joke. That can’t hurt you, you know?”\n\n \n\n She looks around before turning back to you. “In fact, whilst the store isn’t busy, maybe you can help me. Daddy is taking me to a production in the city next week. Something chic and cultured. I need to look amazing.” \n\n \n\n She briefly looks down at the clothes stacked up on the counter, derision on her face. Then, back at you. “There are too many horrors here to sift through. Do you think you could manage to find something suitable? You might be as bumpkin as everyone else in this town, but even you must have some idea of what I am looking for.” She pauses, her smile fading just slightly. When she speaks again, her voice is softer, but almost dangerous. “You haven’t forgotten everything you once were, have you?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n\n \n \n You inhale deeply, feeling the Charm magic coil in your chest, then exhale. An almost imperceptible mist of enchantment drifts toward her and settles around her like a delicate haze. You whisper, voice hushed but resonant: “Leave me alone.”\n\n \n\n Her pupils dilate, and for a heartbeat her confident mask slips. You see surprise flicker, then shoulders drop and the edge in her posture melts away. She clears her throat, voice gentle.\n\n \n\n “I… I can manage,” she murmurs, voice unsteady. “I’ll find something on my own.”\n\n \n\n There’s a curiosity on her face, as she fights against the impact of the spell. “After you, my own fashion sense was well below par. Yours is…”\n\n \n\n Her eyes narrow as she can’t quite finish the sentence. A faint flush rises on her cheeks as she stammers, “Sorry. I didn’t mean…”\n\n \n\n Christina offers a small, unsteady curtsy, then turns on her heels. You watch her leave, chest fluttering at the quiet power of those simple words. The feeling of tricking Christina brings a warmth to your soul. And with some worry, you try to remember feeling anything since dropping into your performance on the sales stand. As much as you try, you can't recall one at all.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n \n \n Sneak up to the office - *You feel compelled to work throughout today as Jennifer told you to*\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n You draw in a steady breath and whisper “Leave me alone,” letting the Charm magic flow toward Christina. The air shimmers as it drifts over her. For a moment you think it’s working: her brow flickers, her posture hesitates -\n\n \n\n Then, almost imperceptibly, her confidence snaps back. Christina’s eyes narrow as she tilts her head, her gaze locking onto yours with sharp intensity. The faint haze of your spell dissipates around her like water against stone.\n\n \n\n “Did you just try to use magic on me?” she murmurs quietly. She seems uncharacteristically muted and considered. “You would dare. You turned your back on all of that…”\n\n \n\n You hold her stare, heart pounding, as exhaustion and shame wash over you. The magic you summoned, faltered. The power you relied on, evaporated.\n\n \n\n A smile appears on her face, but her eyes remain wary. “You wouldn’t be looking to get back into the game, now would you, Jen?”\n\n \n \n She appraises you and the smile broadens. ”No.\" Her voice comes, voice low. Quiet. \"After all, the curses are still active. If you had anything left, I'm sure they'd be gone. So let’s just chalk this up to a misstep.”\n\n <>\n \n \n Christina straightens her back, mentally dusting herself off. “Now,” she says, asserting her dominance over the situation. “About that outfit.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n\n You straighten your shoulders and meet Christina’s cool gaze. “I’m sorry, but I’m swamped today. I can’t help you.”\n\n \n\n Her lips curl into an elegant, poisonous smile. “You hardly look busy,” she purrs. “Perhaps I will tell father you’ve been slacking off when I walked in.”\n\n \n\n Something inside you snaps. You step forward, voice low and controlled. “Don’t push me, Christina. Don’t try me.” You hold her eyes with yours. “You might think you’re something special, but really you’re just another spoiled schoolgirl. You have no power here.”\n\n \n\n Christina looks at you, confused and almost worried. “What do you mean by that?” \n\n \n\n You keep your tone neutral, though your heart hammers in your chest. “What do you think I mean?”\n\n \n\n Christina’s icy blue eyes narrow, uncertainty creeping into their sheen. She glances away for a heartbeat, as if weighing your words. Then she whispers, almost fearful, “You wouldn’t dare. You turned your back on all of that…”\n\n \n\n *Where did that come from?* you wonder, even as you fight to conceal how shaken you yourself feel.\n\n \n\n Christina seems to pull herself together when you don’t reply, but there’s still a wariness to her stare. “I don’t think you still have that inside of you,” she murmurs.\n\n \n\n ”After all, all the curses are still active, Jen. If you had anything left, I would expect some tampering.”\n\n \n\n You say nothing. Holding her gaze. She snorts and sighs dramatically. “Whatever. It’s no fun if you don’t respond. Be seeing you, Jen.”\n\n \n\n You watch her go. The sensations of standing up against Christina course through your body, like something awoken. Bringing you out of the glaze that seems to have overtaken you since working the counter.\n\n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n \n \n Sneak up to the office - *You feel compelled to work throughout today as Jennifer told you to*\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n You straighten your shoulders and meet Christina’s cool gaze. “I’m sorry, but I’m swamped today. I can’t help you.”\n\n \n\n Her lips curl into an elegant, poisonous smile. “You hardly look busy,” she purrs. “Perhaps I will tell father you’ve been slacking off when I walked in.”\n\n \n\n Something in you welters. Christina, watching you carefully, seems to spot the doubt on your face. “I’m not scared of you, Jen. I haven’t been scared of you for quite some time. You might still fool some people with the bravado, but all I see is a meek little shop girl. Maybe the self-confident high achiever back at school was the mask, after all.”\n\n \n\n You gulp. Finding yourself lost for words.\n\n \n\n “Now. About that help. And to be clear, you’re the help, here.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n\n You glance at the till, piled high with receipts and customer requests. “Sorry, Christina, I’m swamped,” you say, voice curt. “I’ve got sales to ring up, restocks to sort, and display checks to finish.”\n\n \n\n She arches an elegant brow. “Hardly looks like you’re busy,” she retorts, stepping close enough so you can smell her perfume. “You wouldn’t be trying to slack off, would you, Jen?”\n\n \n\n You let a cold edge slip in. “You can tell me about being busy when you work a day in her life.”\n\n \n\n She reacts with a thin smile. “Be careful now, Jennifer,” she says quietly. “You wouldn’t want me telling daddy how rude the service was today, would you?”\n\n \n\n A flicker of anger warms your cheeks, but you bite back another retort. The threat in her tone reminds you where you stand.\n\n \n\n “Fine,” she says when you don’t respond. “Remember your place, Jen. You're not top-dog anymore. Not for quite some time.\"\n\n \n\n She turns on her heels and glides away. You watch her go. The sensations of standing up against Christina course through your body, like something awoken. Bringing you out of the glaze that seems to have overtaken you since working the counter. \n\n \n\n But there’s a mixture of something else there too. Your cheeks redden as you repeat her final words in your head. Along with the defiance, there’s shame in there too.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n \n \n Sneak up to the office - *You feel compelled to work throughout today as Jennifer told you to*\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You sigh, steeling yourself, and follow Christina back to the ladies’ fashion rails.\n\n \n\n She plucks a fuchsia sheath from the rack and holds it against you. “This is far too loud,” she snaps, tossing it back. “Honestly, Jennifer. Did they teach you nothing about balance at Charlton?”\n\n \n\n You slide out a muted silver wrap instead. “This drapes nicely -”\n\n \n\n She rolls her eyes. “Silver? At a theatre production? I’ll look like a walking mirror.”\n\n \n\n An hour crawls by in the same rhythm. You produce dress after dress and she dismisses each one. Her voice drips with thinly veiled threats, constantly mentioning her father and his impending disappointment at your work ethic with every hanger you hand her.\n\n \n\n You feel the afternoon bleed away under her scorn. Each criticism weighs heavier than the last: the fabric is too stiff, the cut too conservative, your own taste too provincial. If this is what Jennifer must endure in retail, you wonder why she hasn’t walked out of Charlton and never looked back.\n\n \n\n At last, Christina abandons the exercise. “None of this is right,” she declares. “Perhaps I’ll simply borrow from a friend. One who knows style.” She brushes past you, expression cool.\n\n \n\n You straighten, quietly relieved that the ordeal is over. As she disappears down the aisle, you murmur under your breath, “Well done, Jen. Always good to indulge your betters.”\n\n \n\n Afternoon wasted, you stand in the centre of the store alone. Wondering if Christina ever had any intention of buying something this afternoon.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>",

    "text": "**Evans' Department Store**\n\n[image: ./images/Evans_Department_Store_Reception.png]\n\nA wood-paneled reception dominated by a lone desk, an old rotary telephone, and a frosted door with Terry Evans' name stenciled into it. The muted decor radiates sterile authority and quiet isolation.\n\n You slip away from the sales floor, heart thudding, and quickly ascend the narrow staircase to the upper level. The air grows still and hushed. Gone are the bright rails and glass displays, replaced by warm wood paneling, muted green accents, and quiet overhead lights that lend the reception a calm, somber precision.\n\n \n\n A lone wooden desk stands beneath a wall clock, an old rotary phone perched at its corner; framed abstract prints hang on the walls, their muted tones echoing the soft carpet underfoot.\n\n \n\n Behind the desk sits Mary Handle. A woman in her forties with motherly poise. Her blouse is crisply ironed, her hair pulled into a tidy chignon, and though laugh lines crease the corners of her eyes, she wears them like a badge of experience. When she looks up, her gaze is both welcoming and perceptive, as if she’s seen every kind of face pass through these doors.\n\n \n\n She looks up from the shift roster, offering you a warm, practised smile. “Jennifer,” she says, voice soft and steady. “Everything all right? Need to see Mr. Evans? He’s always happy to make time for his girls.” \n\n \n\n You step forward, your heart ticking like the clock on the wall. You know Mary is Terrence’s mother and that the note you found at Jennifer’s apartment had her phone number on. You need to find out what it means, and you bet that Mary can help you make sense of it.\n \n \n Mary continues to patiently wait for you to talk. A soft creak from inside Terry’s office makes her jump. The pulse in your throat quickens.\n \n \n Mary waits for you to speak. Through the frosted door you hear heavy footsteps, followed by a growl of curses and muttered profanity that rattles the wood. Mary’s polite smile falters for the briefest moment. Her eyes dart toward the door, then back to you, calm and composed despite the storm thriving just out of sight.\n \n\n The door slams open with a crack that rattles the reception desk glass. Terry Evans fills the frame, his silver hair mussed, blue eyes locking on to you. “Jenna!”\n\n \n\n Mary returns quickly to looking at the schedule in front of her, leaving you alone. Terry smiles thinly as he looks at you. “I thought I heard you,” he says in a low voice. “Come on in.”\n\n \n\n You look back to Mary, then to the corridor. Neither feels like an option. Terry gestures with his thumb for you to join him.\n \n \n\nActions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n \n <>",

Too often you've seen things in this section where your mind has jumped to what Jennifer would like wearing it. Now, the thought process is the same. But in the image, you’re Jennifer. And Jennifer is you.\n\n \n\n Do you want to appear sexy for your man? the snide voice that lives in your head snaps at you. Imagining what he’ll say when he sees you.\n\n \n\n You bite your lip. Your eye wanders to a rack of silk nightwear. You’ve seen Jen in a similar one before, but these seem like a different design. The hemline short, the top more open. Backless, tied together by lace trim.\n\n \n\n Something in you stirs. A picture of what it would be like to wear it. You can’t escape it. Looking at it is turning you on.\n\n \n\n You pick up a couple, and mull over what colour to buy.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You pick out the pink colour.

    "text": "The male selection is sparse but straightforward. One rack of folded shorts and T-shirts in muted greys and dark blues. No labels boast of trend or appeal. Every one lists out the benefits to exercise. Moisture-wicking, stretch-fit, durable.\n\n \n\n You find a pair of shorts in your size, along with a workout shirt. The fabric is light but tough, designed to move with you and soak up sweat without complaint. There’s nothing flashy about any of it. No mesh panels, no logos, no tailoring to accentuate anything.\n\n \n\n It’s not meant to show you off. It’s meant to let you workout. As you check the fit, you feel readiness. These clothes are for testing yourself. Pushing yourself. Winning.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You look around Evans’ Department Store for any sign of workout clothes. After some searching, you notice a sign pointing to “Activewear.”\n\n \n\n The first thing you notice is how small everything is. Cropped tops, high-cut leggings, sheer mesh panels. The whole collection seems less designed for exercise and more for visibility. You scan the tags. Nothing here promises support or durability. But they all will bring attention.\n \n \nYou aren’t sure how you feel about wearing anything here, especially as Emily. Even if you only wear it whilst working out, people will still see. The thought of what you will look like as they watch unnerves you.\n\n \n\n After flicking through racks, you realise there are realistically only three options available to you. On-brand for Evans, the options are distinguished by colour - Red, Black and Pink - but more than the colours, the trims and design on each couldn’t be more different.\n\n \n\n The red set is made of material that is slick, tight, and unmistakably meant to be looked at. The top has a deep scoop neck, and the leggings cut high across the hips. Wearing this would make your body impossible to ignore. When you fold it over your arm, you can’t help but think about being seen in it. And why it feels exciting to imagine it.\n\n \n\n In contrast, the black set is made of matte stretch fabric with glossy straps that criss-cross the back like a harness. There are clasps you can’t imagine being useful for anything athletic. The top even includes a black collar to hold it in-place. You wonder why workout gear would be designed to restrict movement and impede airflow, but it's designed that way. Almost intentional. Not for comfort of the wearer, but the control and restriction of them.\n\n \n\n Finally, the pink set is soft and frilly, with ruffled hems and a cute little bow at the waistband. The top has capped sleeves and a sweetheart neckline. It’s absurd. Infantilising. You can’t imagine anyone taking you seriously whilst wearing it. But as you picture yourself in it, a giggle stifles out from between your lips.\n\n \n\n You regard all three options, trying to see if there is any sense of magic about them. You can’t detect anything, but the urge remains - whichever you choose, you can't help but feel it will reflect a part of you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n Running your hand over the red outfit again, you feel the smooth stretch of the fabric between your fingers. It’s bold. Showy. There’s no pretending this is about fitness. This is about form and how to accentuate the curve of your hips and the cut of your neckline. \n\n \n\n You picture yourself stretching in it. Bending. Squatting. Stretching. Breathing heavy. You imagine how eyes will follow your curves and lines. And not just anyone’s eyes. Men's.\n\n \n\n You pause, caught off guard by the warmth in your chest. You weren’t thinking of smiling, but there it is on your face. \n\n \n\n You fold the outfit carefully and hold it close, already lost in a dream of how you'll look in your future workouts.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You pick up the black outfit again, tracing the lines of the glossy straps and the neat black collar. It’s snug. Intentionally so. You can feel, just from holding it, the way it will wrap around your body. How it’ll press against your skin. How it’ll cling to your throat.\n\n \n\n It’s not made for comfort. That much is clear. It’s made to hold you in place. To keep you still. Presentable.\n\n \n\n You think about how you’ll look in it. What people will think of you as you struggle to breath and move in the straps. For some reason, that doesn’t feel frightening. Paradoxically, it’s empowering.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You hold the pink outfit up to the light. The frills bob slightly, and the little bow at the waist bounces as you shift it in your hands. It’s ridiculous.\n\n \n\n But as the thought crosses your mind, a tiny laugh slips out. You try to stifle it, but fail. The neckline is sweet. The sleeves are puffed. You imagine yourself bouncing into class in it, all smiles and energy. No one would expect anything of you. They would assume you’re a girly girl with little going on in your pink-tarnished brain.\n\n \n\n For a second, that sounds nice. You smile at that thought. The only thought you currently have.\n\n \n\n Maybe thinking’s overrated.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "You walk over to Dennis, hearing your heels clicking on the ceramic as you approach. He glances up and double-takes, his mouth agape as he looks you up and down. You can’t help but smile at his reaction.\n\n \n\n “My gosh, Emily,” he says. “You look…”\n\n \n\n He trails off. You realise he’s not going to complete the sentence. “Thank you,” you say to him. \n\n \n\n You sit down in the booth opposite him. You can’t help but let out a giggle as he continues to stare at you. You sense some butterflies in your stomach in reaction to Dennis’ clear desire for you. Why do I feel flattered that a boy is lusting after me?\n\n \n You walk towards Dennis, smiling as he notices you. His eyebrows rise a little and you see a big grin spreading across his face as he looks you up and down.\n\n \n\n “You look nice,” he stammers out. “Thanks for coming, Em. I wasn’t sure if you would show up!”\n\n \n\n You slide into the booth on the opposite side to him. His eyes glance over your body before he realises what he is doing and looks back up at you. “Sorry.”\n\n \n\n “That’s alright,” you say quietly, unsure how to feel that a boy is checking you out. Especially as you did go to a bit of effort. \n\n \n Dennis notices you as you approach. He gives you a look, then smiles politely. He is wearing a neatly pressed shirt and some awkward looking formal trousers. You can tell he’s disappointed at your lack of effort.\n\n \n\n “Hi Em. It’s nice to see you,” he mumbles.\n\n \n Dennis almost doesn’t notice you as you approach. When he sees you, he looks at what you are wearing and how little effort you’ve put into preparing. He himself is wearing a freshly pressed shirt and some formal trousers that look brand new. Disappointed, he looks down at the table.\n\n \n\n “Hi Em,” he mutters, not meeting your eye.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Flo comes over and the two of you order some drinks and food. Dennis tries to make small talk, but it quickly peters out. He looks flustered and nervous. You consider asking him some questions, but you feel just as awkward as he does. For very different reasons.\n\n \n\n You look back at the shy teenager, fiddling with his glasses. You want to make sure he is satisfied that you are taking this seriously, otherwise you doubt whether he’ll give you the key.\n\n \n\n You really wowed him with your clothes, hair and make-up, so it shouldn’t be too hard to keep him on side and get that key from him.\n\n He seemed pretty happy that you made an effort. With a small amount of effort, you should be able to win him over and get the key.\n \n You didn’t put in much of an effort preparing for the date, so you’ve got a bit of work to make him believe you are taking this seriously. Otherwise, you wonder if he’ll give you the key.\n \n You made no effort at all for this date, so you realise you are going to have to go all out to get him back on-side and make sure he’s happy enough to give you that key.\n\n \n \n\n “So Em,” Dennis blurts out. “What is something you could tell me about yourself that would surprise me?”\n\n \n\n You look back at him, raising an eyebrow. That sounded suspiciously like a question from an online dating guide. He waits for your response. You know you need to make sure he has a good time, but how much do you need to do to get that key?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n “I have a soft spot for nerdy guys,” you say, offering him a coy smile. \n\n \n\n “What?” he stammers. “But why?”\n\n \n\n “I don’t know,” you shrug. “Intelligence just turns me on.”\n\n \n\n “Like, scientists and stuff?” Dennis asks, fascinated by your answer.\n\n \n\n “Not just that,” you tell him. “Just people who know things. They can teach me about things. Like you.”\n\n \n\n Dennis grins. His cheeks blush, but he maintains your eyeline. A rare interaction from him.\n\n \n “My best friend when I was young was Miranda Hilly,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n His eyes widen. “The movie actress?” \n\n \n\n You nod, recalling your sister’s childhood best friend. “She went to my primary school. We used to do everything together, until she started going to auditions. Then one day, she got an agent and the rest is history.”\n\n \n\n “Do you still keep in contact with her?” Dennis asks excitedly. \n\n \n\n You shake your head. “We haven’t spoken in a long time,” you say sadly. You mean it, too. She may bury it, but you know Emily gets upset whenever Miranda is on TV.\n\n \n\n “That’s insane!” Dennis blurts out, enthused. “We should try to go see her on a movie set!”\n\n \n\n You smile politely. “Yeah, maybe we could try,” you say, but offer nothing more.\n\n \n “I used to have a tank full of fish back home,” you say, recalling the aquarium that Emily had in her room back in the city.\n\n \n\n “Do you like fish?” Dennis asks. \n\n \n\n You shrug. “Not particularly.”\n\n \n\n Dennis opens his mouth like he’s going to say something, but nothing comes out. He just stares at you.\n\n \n \n\n The moment is interrupted by Flo, who sets down your order. You both thank her and start eating. Dennis asks you about your food and whether you like it, but struggles to keep the conversation going.\n\n \n\n “So, what’s the most spontaneous thing you’ve done?” Dennis asks you in a tone that tries all too hard to sound casual, and fails miserably.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You think carefully about how Emily would answer the question, trying not to break character and ruin his expectations of you.\n\n \n\n “Well, I went to a comic convention dressed as one of the characters from Sailor Moon,” you tell him, remembering one event that your sister did attend.\n\n \n\n His eyes light up. “Which one?”\n\n \n\n “Tsukino,” you reply, thankful you spent a summer when you were fifteen indulging an anime binge. \n\n \n\n He smiles, mouth open a little. “Do you have pictures?”\n\n \n\n You giggle. “Maybe I’ll send you a few. If you’re nice.” \n\n \n\n Dennis is beaming. “I’d love to see that.”\n\n \n\n You say nothing more, but smile back at him. *Are you enjoying turning him on?*\n\n \n You consider one of the things that you know Emily did when she was younger that will pique his interest. “On the last day of school last year, we all jumped on a train and went to see if we could spy on the filming of the new Ultra Girl movie.”\n\n \n\n “What?” he stammers, shocked.\n\n \n\n You recall how Emily told you and your parents when you found out. “We learned that they were filming it in a forest just outside the city, so we got tickets to the nearest station and then hiked to try and find the location.\"\n\n \n\n “What happened?”\n\n \n\n You laugh, remembering the end of the tale. “Security guards caught us before we even got close. I ran away and ended up twisting my ankle. My parents weren’t happy when I was dropped off at home by one of the Production Assistants. But they gave me some signed autographs anyway.”\n\n \n\n Dennis smiles, clearly happy that you and him have some shared interests. Maybe Emily and him would make a good couple, you think. Although, it is me currently acting as Emily…\n\n \n\n You find yourself lost in worrying thoughts and the conversation peters out. \n\n \n “I don’t know,” you shrug. “I guess moving here was pretty spontaneous.”\n\n \n\n “Why did you move here?” Dennis asks.\n\n \n\n “My parents,” you reply, without feeling. “They wanted to get away from the city. I didn’t have much of a choice.” \n\n \n\n You find yourself drifting into your own thoughts, realising that for once, your thoughts are definitely your own and not a mixture of your perception of someone else. \n\n \n\n Coming back to reality, you look up at Dennis. “Not really that spontaneous, was it?”\n\n \n\n He smiles politely, but without comment.\n\n \n \n\n You both turn your attention back to your meals, finishing eating. Breaking the silence, you ask Dennis about his parents and where he lives. He talks without much enthusiasm about how his parents met at the Town Hall, where his dad works as an accountant and his mother a clerk, until she quit when Dennis was born. He doesn’t give you a hook to ask follow-up questions and once again the two of you fall into silence.\n\n \n\n Dennis takes the opportunity to try another conversation starter straight from a how-to guide. “So, how would you describe yourself in 5 words?“\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n “I have a better idea,” you say, coyly. “Why don’t you describe me?”\n\n \n\n Dennis’ eyes widen. “I don’t know…” he stammers. \n\n \n\n “Oh come on,” you tell him. “Just one word then. How would you describe me?”\n\n \n\n Dennis looks at you, his lip quivering. “Pretty,” he says, immediately looking down at the table.\n\n \n\n “You think I’m cute?” you ask him, playfully. \n\n \n\n He nods, barely glancing up at you. “Yes.”\n\n \n\n Instinctively you lean forward, lowering your voice to a conspiratorial tone. “Well, I happen to think you’re cute too.”\n\n \n\n You watch his eyes flick up to you, even looking down. He is blushing profusely, but a grin spreads across his face. “You’re hot,” he whispers.\n\n \n\n “Dennis!” you whisper. “You’ll make me blush.”\n\n \n\n His smile widens. You notice his eyes flick over your body with a flicker of desire.\n \n \n “I don’t know,” you say, smiling. “Happy, carefree, hopefully fun to be around. That’s only three though.”\n\n \n\n “I think you’re fun,” Dennis says. You watch his cheeks redden. “I like hanging out with you. You don’t make fun of me. Or the things I like. Like movies and comic books and stuff.”\n\n \n\n You smile. “I like hanging out with you too, Dennis.”\n\n \n\n “Besides,” you add, thinking honestly about Emily’s own hobbies. “I happen to like those things too.”\n\n \n\n You watch a smile creep up on his face. This time, he dares look directly at you.\n \n \n You think about how you would describe your sister. “Bookish, studious, caring, honest, shy.”\n\n \n\n Dennis grimaces, unsure what to do. “So you like school?” he asks. \n\n \n\n “I used to,” you say. “Not so much at Charlton.” \n\n \n\n “I don’t like it, either,” he says. “I can’t wait to leave.”\n\n \n\n “One more year to go,” you add. \n\n \n\n Dennis smiles sympathetically. You feel a shared sense of camaraderie over your feelings about school, but there’s nothing romantic or sensual about the bond. Dennis looks away, surveying the coffee shop, and you can see the desperation and disappointment in his face about how the conversation is going.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n \n \n \n The two of you are interrupted by Florence, who puts down a platter with the bill on. Without hesitating, Dennis takes out his wallet and puts some cash down, leaving Florence a decent tip.\n\n \n\n The two of you stand, Dennis putting on his coat, you taking your purse, and you both walk towards the coffee shop door. Continuing his chivalrous behaviour, Dennis opens the door for you. \n\n \n\n You take a step into the street, feeling the cold temperature of the night hit you. Dennis walks out behind you, and you stand looking at each other, a nervous tension in the air.\n\n \n\n “Thank you for the dinner,” you say to Dennis. “I had a nice time.”\n\n \n\n \n “So did I!” he says. You watch him smile, his eyes slyly wandering over you. “Would you like to do this again? Another date, I mean?”\n\n \n\n “Maybe,” you tell him, smiling. You can’t help but notice how the nervous boy has warmed to you, exuding a quiet confidence with your encouragement over the evening.\n\n \n\n “How about a movie night?” he says. “You could pick out a film from the AV library and we could watch it at my house.”\n \n \n\n \n \n “I’m sure there would be something in there that would take my fancy,” you reply, hoping to steer the conversation back to the key. *That’s why you came on this date. Isn’t it?*\n\n \n\n He takes the hint and reaches into his coat, taking out a small brass key. “Oh yes.” Taking a step towards you, he offers it to you. “Here you go.”\n\n \n\n Dennis stands close to you, his hand out offering you the key. You look down on it and note the Charlton crest etched on it. Gently, you take it from him.\n \n \n \n \n\n \"And the pass?\" you ask, reminding him.\n\n \n\n Dennis nods eagerly and smiles nervously. “I'll also speak to Harrow. I'm sure I can convince him to get you a pass.”\n\n \n\n You offer him a smile, feeling a pain at embarrassment about how transactional this date feels. “Thank you,” you murmur.\n \n \n \n “I’m sure there would be something in there that would take my fancy,” you reply, hoping to steer the conversation back to the pass. *That’s why you came on this date. Isn’t it?*\n\n \n\n He takes the hint and smiles nervously. “I'll also speak to Harrow. I'm sure I can convince him to get you a pass.”\n\n \n\n You offer him a smile, feeling a pain at embarrassment about how transactional this date feels. \"Thank you.\"\n \n \n \n\n “I really had a great time tonight,” he says quietly. And without warning, he leans in to kiss you. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n “I had a nice time too!” he replies, glancing up at you. “Would you… like to do this again sometime?”\n\n \n\n You smile at his nervous attempts to ask you on another date. “Maybe,” you reply.\n\n \n\n “We could watch a movie together?” he says, taking your words with encouragement. “Maybe over at my house?” \n\n \n\n “Let’s see,” you tell him, not wanting to commit Emily to something that she may not want to do. Or you, if you were to take Emily’s place again. “Maybe I could pick a movie and see if there’s something I’d like?”\n\n \n\n \n \n Dennis nods eagerly and, remembering your deal, reaches into his coat and takes out a small brass key. “You can look through the cupboard, if you like. Pick anything you like. I’d love to watch something with you.”\n\n \n\n He hands you the key. You note the crest of Charlton etched into it. “I’ll see what I can find,” you murmur.\n \n \n\n “Anything!” Dennis continues. “Anything you like!”\n\n \n\n \n \n \"And the pass?\" you ask, reminding him.\n\n \n\n Dennis nods eagerly and smiles nervously. “I'll also speak to Harrow. I'm sure I can convince him to get you a pass.”\n\n \n\n You offer him a smile, feeling a pain at embarrassment about how transactional this date feels. “Thank you,\" you murmur.\n \n \n\n \n You put the key into your purse and give Dennis a smile. “Well. It’s getting late. I better get home.”\n\n \n Dennis nods eagerly and smiles nervously. “I'll also speak to Harrow. I'm sure I can convince him to get you a pass.”\n\n \n\n You offer him a smile, feeling a pain at embarrassment about how transactional this date feels. “Thank you. And I’ll see what I can find,” you murmur.\n \n \n\n “Anything!” Dennis continues. “Anything you like!”\n\n \n\n You give Dennis a smile. “Well. It’s getting late. I better get home.”\n\n \n \n\n He nods, but doesn’t move. As if he’s waiting for something. *A kiss, maybe?*\n\n \n\n “Goodnight Dennis,” you tell him, gently. \n\n \n\n His mouth flinches, but he nods again. “Goodnight, Emily. I’ll see you soon?” \n\n \n\n You titter. “We’ll see.” \n\n \n\n It’s enough to bring a beaming grin to his face. As he walks off, you notice a spring in his step. You watch him go, leaving you alone with only the sounds of pigeons in the trees to keep you company.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n \n \n “Did you?” Dennis snaps back, a little frustration in his voice. “Or did you just want the key?” \n\n \n “Did you?” Dennis snaps back, a little frustration in his voice. “Or did you just want a hall pass?” \n\n \n \n\n He looks up at you and you can see he’s shaking a little. “You didn’t really want to go on a date with me, did you?”\n\n \n\n “Dennis…” you begin. But you trail off, unsure what to say.\n\n \n\n “If you didn’t want to be here, you could have just said,” he continues. He sighs and lets out a bit of his frustration. You can tell he’s hurt by your lack of effort. “I thought, maybe, there was a chance you liked me.”\n\n \n\n He looks at the floor, not meeting your eye line. Consoling a boy who likes you but you have no interest in is not something you’ve had much experience dealing with.\n\n \n\n “I’ve got to go,” he says, finally. “Goodnight Emily.”\n\n \n\n \n \n “What about the key?” you blurt out.\n\n \n “What about the pass?” you blurt out.\n\n \n \n\n He looks up at you. “I’ve changed my mind.”\n\n \n\n \n \n You watch Dennis turn on his heels and walk off, leaving you alone on the quiet street outside Fresh Pot, accompanied only by the sounds of pigeons cooing in the night. It looks like you’ll have to find some other way of getting into the AV room.\n\n \n You watch Dennis turn on his heels and walk off, leaving you alone on the quiet street outside Fresh Pot, accompanied only by the sounds of pigeons cooing in the night. It looks like you’ll have to find some other way of getting a hall pass.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You feel his lips meet yours. Awkward, nervous, but present. A boy’s lips against your own. And you let yourself respond.\n\n \n\n Thoughts flash through your mind. *You already have what you wanted. You don’t need to do this. So why are you responding?*\n\n \n\n But you find yourself pressing your lips against his, letting your mouth lock with his. You feel a surge of butterflies in your stomach as you kiss him back. You actually want this, don’t you?\n\n \n\n You feel his hand on the back of your neck, pulling you in for an embrace as you continue to lock lips. He is tender, clumsy even, but being pulled up against him feeling your bodies touch as your mouths meet sends shocks across your frame.\n\n \n\n After some moments, he pulls back and looks at you, his eyes close to yours. You feel his arms awkwardly around your waist, holding you close to him.\n\n \n\n “We should do this again,” he says, with a quiet confidence you have rarely seen from him before.\n\n \n\n You hear yourself giggle. “I’d like that.”\n\n \n\n He smiles and plants another kiss on your lips before letting you go. “I’ll see you at school,” he says. Uncharacteristically for Dennis, it’s not a question.\n\n \n\n He grins again and waves, as he walks off, a definite spring in his step. You feel yourself smiling as you watch him go. *What was that?* \n\n \n\n He rounds a corner into another street and leaves you alone on the pavement. You notice Flo looking out from behind the blinds of Fresh Pot. She gives you a conspiratorial smile.\n\n \n\n \n \n Only then do you remember the key in your hand. You put it away and come back to your senses, trying in vain not to let your thoughts on what just happened. A kiss. With a boy.\n\n \n Only then do you come back to your senses, trying in vain not to let your thoughts on what just happened. A kiss. With a boy.\n\n \n \n You feel his lips on yours, awkward and nervous. Instinctively you pull away, taking a step back.\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry,” Dennis stammers, looking to the floor. “I shouldn’t have done that.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at the boy in front of you, shaking with embarrassment. He looks wounded. Hurt. Scared stiff, unable to move, but as if he wants to be anywhere but here.\n\n \n\n “I should go,” he mutters. “Goodnight.”\n\n \n\n He spins around and strides off, almost jogging to get away. You watch him go. Not once does he look back.\n\n \n\n \n \n You feel the cold brass key in your hand and quickly put it away. At least you got the key. You just wonder how Dennis will react to you going forward now.\n\n \n You consider if Dennis will keep his word to speak to Harrow. And wonder how Dennis will react to you going forward now.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

You don’t want to end up like Tandi, do you?”\n\n \n\n Britney twizzles a strand of her curly blonde hair, looking to see she has split ends. “It’s just… every morning! I have to get up at, like, eight o’clock to make it in time.”\n\n \n\n “Quit whining!” Stacey barks back. “Do you know how hard it was to get the key to the kitchen?

    "text": "The morning shift at Fresh Pot is quiet. The windows are still misted from the early air, and the soft rattle of the espresso machine hums beneath the low murmur of conversation. You glance around the café and sigh, stepping into Florence’s routine. Wiping down surfaces. Replacing bakery stock. Folding napkins just so. You try to mimic the easy efficiency you've seen from her on your rare visits.\n\n \n\n Then the door creaks open… and Andrea walks in. You almost don’t recognise her at first.\n\n \n\n Gone is the lacy French Maid uniform that Charlton Hotel insists on. Instead, she’s wearing a simple cardigan and jeans. Her hair tied back loosely. It's the first time you’ve seen her dressed out of costume. For a moment, that feels more disorienting than the uniform ever did.\n\n \n\n She gives you a glance - soft, tired - and heads straight for one of the booths near the back.\n\n \n\n You wipe your hands, glance toward the empty counter, and cross the floor. “Hey,” you say gently. “You alright?”\n\n \n\n Andrea shrugs. She tries to play it off with a small exhale through her nose, but the slump in her shoulders tells you everything. “Didn’t sleep,” she mutters. “Lennox kept me late. Had me redoing the same load of linen three times. Then he asked if I’d ‘ironed the bows’ on my apron before I left.”\n\n \n\n You raise an eyebrow. She gives a hollow smirk. “I didn’t know I was supposed to. Guess I’ll add that to the list.”\n\n \n\n You sit across from her as she stares at the table. “And Sermon... he’s been watching me more. Following me with his eyes.”\n\n \n\n There’s a pause. She doesn’t look up. “He used to do the same with Amber. Before she quit. And we all know where she ended up.”\n\n \n\n Your stomach twists. You’re not sure who Amber is, or where she ended up. But you bet it isn’t good.\n\n \n\n The bell over the door rings again. Customers. The line at the counter is starting to build. You know you won’t earn tips unless you’re behind it, smiling sweetly and handing over cappuccinos with perfect froth. But Andrea looks like she’s barely holding herself together.\n\n \n The morning rush hasn’t started yet. You’ve just finished stacking croissants in the display case when the door creaks open and Andrea walks in. Like clockwork. She makes her way to the booth by the window, shoulders hunched.\n\n \n \n “Morning, Flo,” she says, flatly, as you approach. Her voice is tired.\n\n \n\n You slide into the seat across from her. “Rough night?”\n\n \n\n Andrea scoffs softly. “Define rough.”\n\n \n\n Another customer enters. The kettle behind the counter whistles.\n\n \n\n Andrea glances out the window like she’s somewhere else. But she came here again. To talk. To sit. To feel safe. Even if only for a few minutes.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n Lunchtime at Fresh Pot isn’t quiet. It’s controlled chaos, and that control is fraying by the second. Office workers pile in with tired eyes and clipped voices. Retail girls gossip at the counter while tradesmen bark orders across the queue. You wipe a streak of syrup from your arm and try to remember how many sugars that last order had.\n\n \n\n Whilst serving, you move around the counter to waitress at the tables. One patron subtly tries to get your attention with a hand raised casually at you.\n\n \n \n Notebook open. Pen positioned neatly by the side. You recognise him from his profile picture in the local paper immediately. Owen Oakwood. Reporter for the Charlton Gazette.\n\n \n \n You approach cautiously, order pad in hand. “Afternoon,” you say.\n\n \n\n He looks up, eyes cutting through the lenses of his black rimmed glasses. A smile blooms, false and pristine. “Well now,” he says, voice syrup-smooth. “If it isn’t Fresh Pot’s very own example of feminine fortitude.”\n\n \n\n You blink. “Excuse me?”\n\n \n\n He gestures vaguely at you, pen still in hand. “Hardworking. Presentable. Composed. A model for the younger generation of Charlton.”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t wait for a reply. “I’ll take a grilled chicken panini. And a black coffee, naturally. None of that almond milk nonsense. Can’t imagine who introduced that sort of thing around here.”\n\n \n\n You smile politely, without comment. “One second,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Lunchtime is a busy period for Fresh Pot. Office and retail workers from the Charlton flood in on their lunch breaks, frantic to eat something before returning to work. Meanwhile, tradesmen pull up and dash in to grab something between jobs.\n\n \n\n Owen Oakwood is already at his booth as the rush comes in. Notebook out. Coffee half-sipped. He’s been writing, waiting, watching. When you approach with his usual order, he doesn’t even look up. “Florence,” he says casually. “Still working hard, I see. Still resisting the inevitable, I assume? How’s that reading come along?”\n\n \n\n You smile thinly. “Okay. When the job gives me quiet time.”\n\n \n\n He looks up now, glasses flashing. “Ah, priorities. This town runs on young women like you. Pleasant. Pretty. Perfect.” His fingers tap the rim of his coffee cup. “We all have a place. And yours should be in a home, don’t you agree?”\n\n \n \n You say nothing. Your jaw is tight. But you see the notes he’s left on the table. Just within reach. Of you. And him.\n\n \n\n Behind you, you hear another giggle. You look back briefly to Stacey and Britney. They whisper conspiratorially between themselves. \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [Old Fashioned Values] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n The lunch rush has faded into silence, and with it, most of your energy. You move slowly behind the counter, wiping down trays and resetting sugar bowls. Your feet are aching from the heels. At this point, you’d give anything for a moment off them, but Ron keeps drifting in and out of the back room like a spectre. Watching. Checking.\n\n \n\n Just as you think you might get a breather, the bell above the door rings. Two women step in, framed by light from the street. Pristine. Perfect. Powerful in that quiet Charlton way. Hazel Evans and Jeanette Thompson. You recognise them both instantly.\n\n \n\n Hazel is Christina’s mother, poised and polished in a pale blouse and gold bracelets. Jeanette is the wife of Mr. Thompson, sharp-eyed and immaculately coiffed, her pearls resting neatly at the hollow of her throat.\n\n \n\n Shopping bags dangle from their wrists. The smell of department store perfume follows them like a mist. “Honestly,” Hazel is saying, “I’ve told Terry again and again. The girls want refined silhouettes. Dresses with structure. Not all this… form fitting nonsense.”\n\n \n\n Jeanette gives a disapproving sniff. “Logain took a girl out last week. Britney Hudson. She turned up in a skirt that was practically a belt.”\n\n \n\n “Ah, Britney,” Hazel drawls. “She’s lucky she comes from money. If she didn’t, well… let’s just say I’d be surprised if she ended up anywhere respectable.”\n\n \n\n They both laugh softly, conspiratorially, like they’re sharing a joke only they understand.\n\n \n\n You approach the counter as they reach it, and Hazel leans in with a flawless smile.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n The afternoons at Fresh Pot always follow the same rhythm. Silence. Cleaning. Ron’s occasional peeking. And then the door opens. Hazel Evans and Jeanette Thompson.\n\n \n\n Shopping bags. Tennis skirts. Voices already halfway through a conversation.\n\n \n \n “...and I told Terry, if we can’t trust the girls in fitting rooms not to stretch the fabric, we need to stop stocking elastane.”\n\n \n\n You nod at them politely as they approach the counter. “Two almond croissants,” Hazel says, like it’s already been rehearsed.\n\n \n\n “Light roast coffee,” Jeanette adds.\n\n \n\n They pay with a twenty. Again. And before you’ve even finished counting out the change, Hazel is peering into your palm with narrowed eyes. “Oh dear, I think we’ve had this little mistake before.”\n\n \n\n “Ron never has these problems,” Jeanette murmurs.\n\n \n\n Hazel smiles sweetly. “Now, Flo. Two big coins. One small one. Let’s not make it harder than it needs to be.”\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n \n \n \n \n [Ditzy] <> - Try as you might, you just can't seem to think straight\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n [Citizen Charlton] <> - You can't muster up the courage to challenge them\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n [Citizen Charlton] Argue with them - For some reason you can't bring yourself to argue with them\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n The evening shift at Fresh Pot has a different rhythm. Slower, quieter. The lunch crowd’s long gone, replaced by couples on casual dates, lonely souls with lattes, and a few regulars decompressing after work. You find yourself weaving between tables, tray in hand, smile at the ready.\n\n \n\n You catch a few sideways glances from other girls. Not glares exactly, but close. Their dates, meanwhile, seem a little too eager to thank you for their orders. You’re starting to see a pattern.\n\n \n \n Then you spot them near the back window: Brendan, a quarterback from school, slouched in his seat with the permanent smirk of someone who thinks charm is a personality trait. And Chantelle, Charlton Academy’s queen of eye-rolls and perpetual exasperation.\n\n \n\n You approach to take their order, and Brendan immediately lights up. Too bright, too quick. “Evening,” he says, voice dripping with the kind of flirtation you’ve seen used on a dozen other girls. “Didn’t think Fresh Pot came with such… refined service.”\n\n \n\n You smile tightly. Chantelle groans audibly.\n\n \n\n They place their order. Mocha for her, flat white for him. And you walk off.\n\n \n\n From behind the counter, you can still hear them. Chantelle’s voice, low and annoyed: “You’ve been staring at her this whole time. Just like with Emily Phillips.”\n\n \n\n Brendan laughs it off. “You know I’m just being nice. Come on. It’s harmless.”\n\n \n\n But his eyes flick back to you. More than once. When Chantelle heads to the bathroom, you bring over the bill. Brendan is all smiles again. “You know,” he says, leaning just a bit too far over the table, “if the coffee came with a smile like yours every time, I’d be here every night.”\n\n \n\n He stares back at you, his grin a dare.\n\n \n The dinner crowd at Fresh Pot always has a few familiar faces. And a few too many familiar flirty glances.\n\n \n\n You catch sight of Brendan and Chantelle again, tucked into their usual booth. She’s got her arms crossed. He’s got that grin. You don’t need to hear the conversation to guess how it’s going. But you do anyway.\n\n \n\n “You were looking at her again,” Chantelle snaps, cutting into her salad. “Like with Emily.”\n\n \n \n Brendan shrugs. “What? I was just being friendly.”\n\n \n\n You bring over their drinks, and Brendan gives you a smile that says he hasn’t learned a thing. When Chantelle excuses herself, you return with the bill. Brendan’s eyes follow you as you approach.\n\n \n\n “You know,” he says again, “if they ever need someone to taste test your lattes, I volunteer. Or if you’re off shift, maybe we compare notes.”\n\n \n\n Same smile. Same tone. Same expectation.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n [Boy Crazy] Be professional - You find yourself drawn to his attention\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n As the day draws to a close, you usher the final customers out the door at closing time.

She still sleeps soundly in the chair. Happy that she'll wake up soon, you lock up and leave the shop for the night.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You glance back at the growing line of customers… then sit.\n\n \n\n Andrea doesn’t speak right away. She just lets out a breath and leans her head in her hand, fingers rubbing at her temple. “I know I need the job,” she murmurs eventually. “It’s not that I’m… ungrateful. It’s just…”\n\n \n \n She trails off, staring at the tabletop like it might have the answers.\n\n \n\n “I keep thinking about us. Back at school. You remember? Always thinking things would work out. The teachers were full-on. Sure. But I thought that was the worst of it. Turns out the real world’s just… slower to understand. But meaner. More humiliating. Is this really all there was waiting for us on the other side?”\n\n \n\n Your eyes flick towards the counter. The queue is creeping towards the door. A number of impatient customers give you dirty looks. But you turn back to the young woman opposite you. She exhales again, steadier now.\n\n \n\n “Sorry. Didn’t mean to dump all that on you. I just needed to sit for a second.”\n\n \n\n Before you can respond, a voice snaps from the counter. “What do you have to do to get a coffee around here?”\n\n \n\n Andrea rises, gathering her bag. “I should go. Thanks for listening, Flo.”\n\n \n\n She slips out the door. Shoulders still heavy, but maybe a little less.\n\n \n\n You turn, apologising with a smile as you move around the counter to serve the irritated customers. They barely acknowledge your efforts and tips are not forthcoming. But you feel that, at least, you’ve made Andrea’s day a little better.\n\n \n You sit beside her, trying to ignore the queue forming. She tells you a little more about her evening. About Lennox. And Pierre. On the surface, she is doing what you’d expect from a maid. Cleaning. Washing. Helping out in the kitchen. But the tone from the rest of the staff. You can’t imagine it is easy at all.\n\n \n\n A number of hisses and tuts come from the side, as customers increasingly look at you expecting services. Andrea smiles sweetly, but doesn’t talk much more. When she gets up, she thanks you, as always. And leaves.\n\n \n\n Then it’s back to the counter. Cold stares. No tips. But… Andrea seemed steadier.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You glance at the growing line. “Shall we talk later?” you say gently. “The morning rush is starting. This is important, and I don’t want to brush you off, but…”\n\n \n\n Andrea nods quickly, waving it off. “No. No, I get it. You’ve got customers.”\n\n \n\n She stands, adjusting her coat. “Besides… Lennox is probably already thinking up some new fresh hell to torture me with.”\n\n \n\n She tries to smile. It doesn’t stick.\n\n \n\n You watch her slip out the door. Then turn to the counter. Smiling. Laughing. Taking orders. Letting your voice bubble into sweetness. The tips are good. Especially from the older men. But your thoughts wander. Andrea just wanted someone to talk to. And you couldn’t give her that.\n\n \n Andrea gives you a hopeful look. You smile, but shake your head toward the counter.\n\n \n\n She nods, doesn’t argue. “Another time?”\n\n \n\n “Another time,” you say, trying to enforce a sincerity that you know you can’t guarantee. Would Flo really brush off her friend like this?\n\n \n\n But before you can act on any second thought, she’s gone.\n\n \n\n You turn back to the line, putting on your best fake smile. The men grin at you and the women are polite with their appreciation. The coins clink generously into the tip jar and before you know it, the morning rush is gone.\n\n \n\n But Andrea’s presence still lingers.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You nod and move quickly to the kitchen, returning moments later with his order.\n\n \n\n He sets his pen down again, steeples his fingers, and watches you like you’ve taken a seat in an interview chair. “Florence, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n You hesitate. “Sure.”\n\n \n\n “I must say,” he begins, “I admire a young woman with a sense of duty. That apron suits you. Just the right amount of… modesty.”\n\n \n\n A youthful giggle interrupts your attention. You look back over to the back of the shop, where Britney and Stacey are laughing over pastries and gossiping.\n\n \n\n “All energy and rebellion,” he muses. “But even they will grow to know how girls should act publicly in time. Charlton has a way of instilling proper behaviour.”\n\n \n\n \n\n He sips his coffee. “Tell me, how’s the reading coming along? I’ve heard whispers you’ve been brushing up on your literacy.”\n\n \n\n You nod faintly.\n\n \n\n He smiles. “But surely you’ve realised by now, some things are simply beyond a woman’s grasp. Too much thinking, and suddenly the cake doesn’t rise. The laundry goes cold.”\n\n \n\n You can’t help it. Your eyes narrow. He sees.\n\n \n\n “Oh, don’t be cross. You’re quite good at this, you know,” he says, gesturing with a hand to the coffee shop. All the right instincts. You’ll make some lucky man a perfect little homemaker one day.”\n\n \n\n He tilts his head. “Don’t you agree? A woman’s place… is naturally in the home.”\n\n \n\n You want to say something. To wipe the smile off his face. But the tip he’s already placed on the table is folded, thick, and generous.\n\n \n\n Behind you, you hear another giggle. You look back briefly to Stacey and Britney. They whisper conspiratorially between themselves.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [Old Fashioned Values] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n\n You open your mouth to disagree, but the words that come out surprise even you. “I mean… you’re right,” you hear yourself say. “There’s nothing wrong with a woman wanting to look after a home. That’s just… natural. Isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n Owen beams, as if he’s just confirmed something he’s always known. “There it is,” he says, voice warm with approval. “Knew you had your head on straight. You’re a beacon, Florence. A real light for the young women in Charlton to follow.”\n\n \n\n He reaches into his coat and pulls out a few extra folded notes sliding them onto the table with a practiced elegance. “Put that towards a pretty dress,” he says. “Time to start thinking about bagging yourself a man. Clock’s ticking, after all.”\n\n \n\n You murmur a soft “thank you” before turning away, the cash in your apron pocket already warm.\n\n \n\n You don’t quite remember deciding to say it. But you did.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You glance toward his notebook, letting your voice soften just enough. “Well… maybe the right man is already sitting in front of me.”\n\n \n\n Owen blinks.\n\n \n\n For a moment, he seems to lose his place entirely. His eyes flicking up to yours, then quickly down to the notes in front of him, then back up again. A cough. A polite clearing of the throat.\n\n \n\n “Well, now,\" he says, adjusting his glasses unnecessarily. “That’s quite the… charming notion.”\n\n \n\n You watch his fingers tap the edge of the table, then reach into the inside pocket of his jacket. He produces another folded note - generous in size - and slides it toward you.\n\n \n\n “For your trouble,” he says. “Maybe towards a perfume. Perhaps something floral. Light. The kind of scent that lingers, ever so gracefully.”\n\n \n\n His words are still wrapped in practiced polish, but his ears are definitely pink. “Charlton needs more girls like you, Florence. Steady. Well-mannered. Delightful.”\n\n \n\n You smile. And leave him to his blushing.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You lower your voice just a little, leaning in slightly. “Well, maybe I wouldn’t need to wait for Mr. Right if he stopped just scribbling charming notes right in front of me.”\n\n \n\n Owen raises an eyebrow, his pen pausing mid-sentence. There’s a flicker of amusement in his eyes. More than that though, there's a slight fluster he tries very hard to cover. He straightens, clears his throat, and reaches for his wallet.\n\n \n\n “Ahem. How quaint,” he says, carefully sliding a smaller bill across the table. “Let’s say… that’s for initiative.”\n\n \n\n His smile is tight, but there’s a faint twitch at the corner of his mouth that suggests he’s more affected than he lets on.\n\n \n\n “Still,” he adds, eyes returning to his notebook, “best save those tricks for the right man. No need to waste charm on the press.”\n\n \n\n You turn to go, cheeks warm, but not entirely disappointed.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You inhale slowly, offering a smile that doesn’t quite reach your eyes. “I think there’s merit in women doing a lot more than just homemaking, Mr. Oakwood. Plenty of girls here want to run businesses, study, make something for themselves.”\n\n \n\n Owen’s brow lifts in faint surprise.\n\n \n\n “And,” you add lightly, “some of us can still make a decent cake while we’re at it.”\n\n \n\n There’s a pause. Then the faintest chuckle from him. “Well now,” he murmurs. “A firecracker, aren’t you? Spirited.” He slides the folded tip across the table without ceremony. “Just don’t let that spark burn you out, dear. The world can be rather cruel to girls who think too big.”\n\n \n\n You nod politely and turn away. But inside, something steadier holds you upright.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You take a breath. “I just think, maybe… women shouldn’t be limited to just - homemaking. Not that there’s anything wrong with homemaking. Obviously. But, you know, some girls want… other things. Not baking and cleaning.”\n\n \n\n He raises an eyebrow. “But isn’t what you’ve chosen to do here as a vocation, anyway?”\n\n \n\n You trail off. Even you’re not sure what point you were making. \n\n \n\n Owen pauses, coffee halfway to his lips. Then he smiles. “Oh, dear.” He taps his temple. “This is precisely what I worry about. Too much thinking and your poor brain’s gone in circles. I’ve seen soufflés with more structure than that argument.”\n\n \n\n You flush.\n\n \n\n “But it’s sweet that you’re trying,” he adds kindly. “There’s still hope for you. Once the right man comes along.”\n\n \n\n He lifts his cup. No tip.\n\n \n\n You walk back to the counter, face burning. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You smile, keeping your voice light. “You’re right. A woman’s place probably is… in the home.”\n\n \n\n It tastes strange as you say it. You don’t believe it. Do you? You just need the tip?\n\n \n\n Owen beams. “Exactly what I hoped you’d say. A young woman with such potential - channelled correctly, of course - could be a true beacon for Charlton.”\n\n \n\n He slides the notes across the table. \"Go on,” he says. “Buy yourself something pretty. A new dress, perhaps. One of those pink ones that makes a man think of spring and wives and warm, home-cooked meals.”\n\n \n\n You take the cash, smiling politely.\n\n \n\n It’s just a job, you tell yourself. And this is just playing the part.\n\n \n\n *And who are you trying to convince with that?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You tilt your head. “Actually… I don’t agree. I think women are capable of more than just homemaking. A lot more.”\n\n \n\n Owen stills, the smile on his face frozen mid-charm. Slowly, he slides his hand toward the folded bill on the table and plucks it back, slipping it neatly into his notebook without breaking eye contact.\n\n \n\n “A spirited opinion,” he says, voice tight. “But misplaced. You’ve graduated now, haven’t you? Time is ticking, Florence. That oven won’t stay warm forever.”\n\n \n\n He taps the side of his head. “Better to learn before life teaches you the hard way.”\n\n \n\n You turn away, jaw clenched, but your back a little straighter. He didn’t like what you said. But you said it anyway. And it felt good.\n\n \n\n Even if it cost you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You give Owen a polite nod. “Excuse me,” you say, tone light but firm.\n\n \n\n Before he can respond, you turn from his booth and make your way toward the back - toward the sound of laughter and sugary gossip spilling from Britney and Stacey’s corner.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Coffees, light roast.” she says. “And two almond croissants. We’ve earned it. Hit the courts hard this week.”\n\n \n\n You ring them up. They pay with a twenty.\n\n \n\n You return with their order, a few coins ready in your palm for the change. But the moment you hand it over, Hazel’s expression tightens. “Oh, no dear,” she says, voice smooth but cold. “That’s not right.”\n\n \n\n Jeanette nods. “Ron always gives us a little discount. And this isn’t even the correct amount from a twenty.”\n\n \n\n They lean over the counter together, inspecting the coins like you’re handing them puzzle pieces. Hazel counts deliberately, speaking slowly. “Two of the big coins, Flo. And one of the small ones. Surely that isn’t too tricky.”\n\n \n\n You freeze. You’re sure you counted it right.\n\n \n\n But they’re already slipping into a booth, shaking their heads gently. “Always pays to double-check, doesn’t it, Jeanette?”\n\n \n\n “Especially with girls in jobs like these,” she agrees.\n\n \n\n You try to swallow the heat creeping up your neck.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n \n \n \n \n [Ditzy] <> - Try as you might, you just can't seem to think straight\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n [Citizen Charlton] <> - You can't muster up the courage to challenge them\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n [Citizen Charlton] Argue with them - For some reason you can't bring yourself to argue with them\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n\n You glance down at the coins in your hand, your eyes narrowing as you mentally retrace the bill, the prices, and what you handed over. It all adds up. You know it does.\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry,” you say gently. “But I think the total was £12.60, and I gave you £7.40 in change from the twenty. That’s two pound coins, a fifty, a twenty, and a ten.”\n\n \n\n You pause. “That’s correct, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n Hazel tilts her head, examining the coins again. Jeanette frowns. There’s a silence that stretches a little too long. Then Hazel gives a small, polite smile - tight at the edges. “Ah. So it is. My mistake.”\n\n \n\n Jeanette makes a small noise of agreement, though she doesn’t quite look at you.\n\n \n\n They don’t apologise. But when you return to clear the table later, you find a folded five tucked discreetly beneath a napkin.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You take a breath. “So, the total was £12.60, and you gave me twenty pounds, so that means the change is… um…”\n\n \n\n You trail off, looking at the coins in their hands. Suddenly they all look the same size.\n\n \n\n Hazel raises an eyebrow. “Two of the big coins, dear. And one of the small ones. Not… whatever this is.”\n\n \n\n Jeanette picks up a twenty-pence piece like it’s been fished out of a drain. “This one’s barely got the Queen left on it. Are you sure this is still legal tender, love?”\n\n \n\n You try to protest, but the math is slipping through your fingers like steam. You know you were right when you counted. But now all the coins feel suspicious. Are the fifties even bigger than the pounds? Why are the twos so sneaky?\n\n \n\n “I just thought --”\n\n \n\n “Well that’s the problem, isn’t it?” Hazel says, placing the coins back on the saucer with theatrical delicacy. “You thought.”\n\n \n\n They take their coffees with a huff of polite disappointment. You watch them go, sure of one thing: you were definitely right. You just couldn’t prove it under pressure. Or coin scrutiny.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You clear your throat and try to keep your voice measured. “I understand Ron may have offered a discount before,” you say carefully, “but there’s no formal policy for that. And the change I gave is correct, based on the current prices.”\n\n \n\n Hazel narrows her eyes slightly. Jeanette blinks like you’ve just told her she was banned from the country club. There’s a long pause. Then Hazel exhales. “Well. If that’s how things are now.”\n\n \n\n They take their drinks without further complaint. Hazel even drops a coin into the tip jar.\n\n \n\n You smile politely, heart pounding just a little. You held your ground. And survived.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You try to match their tone, firm but not rude. “I’m not sure what arrangement you had with Ron,” you begin, “but Fresh Pot doesn’t actually offer a discount policy --”\n\n \n\n Hazel’s face pinches. “Excuse me?”\n\n \n\n Jeanette sets her croissant down like it’s poisoned. “Ron always gives us a little something. It’s good manners. Maybe you could learn a bit of that, dear.”\n\n \n\n You try again. “I’m just saying --”\n\n \n\n “Oh no, no need to say anything,” Hazel cuts in sweetly. “Maybe we’ll just have a chat with Ron about his waitress’s attitude. Customer service matters, especially when you’re wearing the apron of Fresh Pot.”\n\n \n \n Jeanette gives you a tight, insincere smile as they stand. You watch them go, resisting the urge to bite your tongue clean through. No tip. Just a promise of an uncomfortable conversation later.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You try to stay polite. Really, you do. But something about the way Hazel says “big coins” like you’ve never seen money before just… snaps something.\n\n \n\n “I gave you the correct change,” you say flatly. “There is no discount. And honestly, maybe if you spent less time critiquing women under thirty and more time checking receipts --”\n\n \n\n Hazel gasps. Jeanette’s eyebrows shoot up like she’s just witnessed a public scandal.\n\n \n\n “Well!” Hazel huffs, collecting her purse like it personally offended her. “I see Ron’s lowered the hiring standards. I’ll be sure to mention that next time we’re at the country club.”\n\n \n\n Jeanette mutters something about “young people these days” as they storm out, heels clacking dramatically.\n\n \n\n No tip.\n\n \n\n Just two perfectly powdered storms in teacups, vanishing out the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n You pause… then quietly take the coins back and count out the “correct” change as Hazel described. Two big coins. One little one.\n\n \n\n She smiles, triumphant. Jeanette gives you a warm pat on the hand like you've just solved your first jigsaw puzzle. “See? That wasn’t so hard,” Hazel says sweetly. “Always good to trust those who know better.”\n\n \n\n They take their croissants and saunter off to the booth by the window, dropping a tip in the jar as they go. You force a smile. But even after they’re seated, the words echo in your skull.\n\n \n\n Two of the big coins. One of the small ones.\n\n \n\n You stare at the till. You were sure that was the right change before. Weren’t you?\n\n \n\n Just for a moment you feel your breath catch. Your grip tightens on the counter, suddenly unsure whether you even know how to count anymore.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n You let a smile tug at your lips, just enough. He’s grinning like a kid who thinks he’s smooth, and, well, he is kinda cute, in that try-hard, Charlton-boy way.\n\n \n\n You lean in slightly, setting the bill down with a flutter of your lashes. “Careful,” you say lightly, “keep talking like that and I might think you actually like the company more than the coffee.”\n\n \n\n Brendan blinks, caught off guard for just a second. Then he laughs, a little too loud, and his chest puffs up like he’s just won a prize.\n\n \n\n “Oh, I definitely know what I like,” he says. “And I tip what I like, too.”\n\n \n\n He slips a folded note onto the tray. More than generous.\n\n \n\n You walk away with a polite smile and his eyes trailing after you. From the corner of your vision, you see Chantelle returning from the bathroom. She’s not smiling.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You try. Really, you do.\n\n \n\n You soften your voice, tilt your head, and reach for something flirtatious. But what comes out is more awkward than alluring.\n\n \n\n “I mean… maybe someone like you could, uh, give me… pointers? About good company. Or something.”\n\n \n\n Brendan grins. “That so?” he says, amused. “Well, hey, points for effort. You’re cute when you try.”\n\n \n\n He still drops a bill onto the tray. Less than he would’ve, but not nothing.\n\n \n\n You catch a glimpse of yourself in the coffee machine’s reflection as you head back to the counter.\n\n \n\n Not your finest moment. But at least your tip jar’s a little fuller.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You approach the situation with practiced calm, placing the bill between the salt and pepper shakers without so much as a glance.\n\n \n\n Brendan leans back in his seat slightly, clearly waiting for a look, a smile, something.\n\n \n\n You offer none.\n\n \n\n “Aw, come on,” he mutters, grin slipping. “Not even a thank you?”\n\n \n\n You smile politely. “Enjoy the rest of your evening.”\n\n \n\n Then you turn and walk away.\n\n \n\n When you circle back to clear the table later, the bill is gone. So is the tip.\n\n \n\n Figures.\n\n \n\n Still, you feel better for not playing along. That kind of attention? It’s not worth chasing.\n\n \n\n Even if your purse feels a little lighter for it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You approach with the bill and don’t say a word at first. Just let your body do the talking.\n\n \n\n You lean slightly over the booth, laying the slip down slowly, deliberately, letting your chest press just a little forward. His eyes flick there immediately. You don’t meet them. You just smile, sweetly, like you hadn’t noticed a thing.\n\n \n\n Brendan exhales through his nose, like he’s trying to stay cool. “Y’know,” he says, “they don’t serve this kind of charm at the school cafeteria.”\n\n \n\n You don’t answer. Just tilt your head, give him the ghost of a wink, and straighten back up. He reaches for his wallet and slips a note under the bill. More than you’d expected. Not as much as he might have, but enough to feel like a win.\n\n \n\n Just as you’re turning away, Chantelle returns. She sits, notices your position, then glances at Brendan. Still watching you with a grin.\n\n \n\n “Oh,” she says, tone flat, scowling at you. “So it’s that the kind of service you offer here now, huh?”\n\n \n\n You don’t answer. You just walk back to the counter. But the comment stays with you. He’s a senior. You’ve seen him at school. This isn’t playful back-and-forth. This wasn’t clever wordplay. This was your body, leaning into something you’re not sure you meant to offer.\n\n \n\n *And it was just for tips… right?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

On more than one occasion you almost slip, but thankfully there’s always a table or countertop for you to grasp on to. It never ceases to make customers chuckle when you stumble. \n\n \n \n\n In fact, there’s a lot that you do that make customers react. Without exception everyone treats you as an old friend. You find yourself returning their smiles and laughing at their jokes. Especially when you receive tips for your efforts.\n\n \n\n It does not go unnoticed how men and women treat you differently. Women are polite and chatty, but the men in their different ways are flirtatious and voyeuristic. You feel their eyes on your legs as you saunter around the coffee shop. You see them staring at your breasts as you lean over to serve them. \n\n \n\n One particularly flirty customer is Dan, from Thompson’s Repairs. You inwardly sigh when you see him walk in. He smiles like a tiger when he sees you and doesn’t take his eyes off you as you prepare a coffee for him.\n\n \n\n “Damn fine cup of coffee” he says as you bring a coffee to his booth. As he reaches into his wallet to pay, you catch him looking you up and down. “Although with legs like those, I’d drink anything you served me.”\n\n \n\n You notice he is taking his time rifling through notes, counting out how much he’s going to pay you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n <>",

A full length mirror runs down one side of the room and a ballet barre runs down the entire length.\n\nGordon, one of the local labourers, sits at one of the weight lifting machines. His tight biceps flex as he pulls the plates high into the air, and then slowly lowers them down with control and confidence.\n\n \n \nCasey stands in the centre of the gym, kicking gym mats together in a square. His hands are encased in blue boxing gloves, yet somehow a lit roll-up dangles on his bottom lip.\n\n \nCasey stands behind the till, leafing through a boxing magazine. A lit roll-up hangs on his lips, which he occasionally takes a drag on.\n\nMrs. DeBussy stands beside the full-length mirror, clipboard clasped firmly to her chest. She wears a collared polo shirt tucked into thick black leggings, ballet slippers barely visible beneath the hem.\n\nJake, the school quarterback, is at the back of the gym, running through some dumbbell exercises. Jake seems to strain at the weight he's chosen, regularly just letting go of the dumbbell once he's lifted it, letting it crash to the floor.\n\n \n \n*You watch Jake for a moment. If you really wanted to know what went on in those boys’ classes, Jake could be an option. If you could get your hands on something of his, something personal. Something to power the amulet.

But then, you are one of my more proactive girls.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes drop momentarily to her clipboard before returning to yours. “Here to take part in my ballet instruction, are you?” she asks, voice syrupy. “A sharpened mind requires a graceful body, after all. And discipline is discipline, no matter the subject.”\n\n \n\n Her smile lingers, polite and practiced. “I’d be very pleased to include you. Provided, of course, you’re willing to take it seriously.”\n\n \n As you approach, DeBussy looks up. A polite smile forms. “Hello dear. I didn’t expect to see you, today. What brings you here?”\n\n \n\n She straightens a little, folding her arms over the clipboard. Her ballet slippers peek out beneath her leggings, though she makes no effort to draw attention to them. “Are you here to partake in my ballet lessons?” she asks when you don’t respond. “Typically I don’t encourage my students to partake. Weekends are for reflection. Quiet study. Perhaps even a little revision.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes meet yours, as if burrowing into your brain to work out your thoughts. “For you though,” she says after some time. “I will make an exception.” A thin smile forms on her lips, but she stands waiting for your answer. \n\n \n \n DeBussy looks up as you approach, a smile appearing that can’t quite mask her confusion. “Good afternoon,” she murmurs. “You’re Emily’s , aren't you? What brings you here?”\n\n \n \n You pause before replying, a cold shiver spreading up your spine. “Yes. I’m Emily’s .”\n\n \n\n \n At this, DeBussy breaks into a smile. “Oh! She’s a bright girl! I shouldn’t say this, but between us two, she’s one of my favourites. So diligent. Observant. A sharp eye for detail. She’ll go far, with the right tutoring.”\n\n A nod comes from the teacher, her smile wavering slightly. “She seems like a pleasant girl. Could do with a little focus, but I can see a certain potential. There are good jobs for young ladies in Charlton if they practice their typing.”\n\n \n\n “Thank you,” you say. “I’m sure she values your teaching.”\n\n \n\n DeBussy breaks out into a smile. “Oh, that’s lovely of you to say. But if you’ll forgive me, I must return to my class. A young lady’s education doesn’t end at the school gates, thank heavens. Or was there something I can assist you with?”\n\n \n As you approach, DeBussy looks up. A polite smile quickly forms on her lips. “Hello dear,” she says in a crisp tone. “What a pleasant surprise. I haven’t seen you in the longest of times.”\n\n \n\n You eye DeBussy cautiously. She wears a set of ballet shoes underneath some thick black leggings that are functional but not revealing. Her collared polo shirt gives an air of superiority that only just seems appropriate in Casey’s Gym.\n\n \n\n “Are you here to partake in my ballet lessons?” she asks you. “My dedication to your moral and physical education doesn’t simply expire after graduation, you know.”\n\n \n\n You eye DeBussy cautiously.

    "text": "**Casey's Gym**\n\n[image: ./images/Gym.png]\n\n \n Gordon doesn’t look up as you step back onto the mats, but his voice acknowledges you. “Alright. Let’s begin.”\n\n \n\n He’s moved a bench into place near the wall-length mirror. A set of pink dumbbells sit neatly arranged beside it. But even as you scan the equipment, you catch your reflection in the glass.\n\n \n\n You knew what Annie looked like. Everyone did. But seeing her from the inside, wearing this. It hits differently. You feel the sway in your hips. The bounce in your step.\n\n \n\n Without looking you can feel Gordon’s eyes on you, clinical and precise. Glancing over at him you notice he doesn’t leer, but his glance tracks your movements just like every other man in Charlton. Just like you remember watching Annie.\n\n \n\n He gives a nod toward the bench. “First set. Overhead presses.”\n\n \n\n You step into position. The moment you lift the weights, you feel the stretch of your arms pulling your top higher. As you push up and down, you feel your chest noticeably rising and falling with every breath. \n\n \n\n Finishing the set, you stand up and shift on the balls of your feet, becoming aware of the way your back arches naturally. You find yourself naturally smiling at Gordon as he resets the machine. You know how inviting that smile can be.\n\n \n\n You should focus on the workout. But part of you wonders if being watched might not be so bad. In this body, it almost feels natural.\n \n \n Whilst you’ve been in the locker room, Gordon has been setting up for the exercise session. He’s placed a bench on the mats in front of the mirror and carefully placed a number of dumbbells to the side. You note the dumbbells are smaller than you’ve used before. Also, they are pink.\n\n \n\n “Ready?” Gordon says, making some final adjustments to his preparations. As far as you can tell, he doesn’t react to your change of clothes. His nonchalant attitude quickly puts you at ease a little, in spite of still feeling slightly exposed standing to the side in Jennifer’s tight leggings and just a sports bra.\n\n \n\n “Let’s begin,” he says, after one last minute change to one of the weights. “First set. Lunges.”\n\n \n\n For the next hour Gordon puts you through your paces, encouraging you when you need it, praising you when you push yourself, calling you out when you take it easy. He doesn't belittle you or put you down, even when you make mistakes.\n\n \n\n You notice how much weaker Jennifer’s body is, straining when holding even the smallest of weights. On the plus side, Jennifer is much more flexible than what you are used to, which allows you to stretch and arch when called for.\n\n \n\n Gordon continues to give you instructions and you drop into the rhythm of following his guidance. He watches you without expression, giving you tips and advice with short, concise statements. He doesn’t come close to you, instead observing you from off-the-mat. Even so, something stirs in you when you think about how you're following his words, obeying his direction, whilst his eyes focus on your body as you move.\n\n \n\n “Don’t lean forward,” Gordon tells you, as you drop into a squat. “Flatten your back.”\n\n \n\n You glance over your shoulder, looking at the muscular man. Your butt is pushed out towards him, and you feel the fabric straining between your buttocks. *This workout is almost tailored to put you on display*, you think.\n \n \n By the time you step back onto the gym floor, Gordon has already rearranged the space. A bench rests on the mats, positioned squarely in front of the mirror. A small rack of pink and purple dumbbells sits neatly beside it, all lighter than what you’re used to.\n\n \n\n Gordon doesn’t comment on your appearance, but you can’t help but catch your reflection in the mirror.\n\n \n\n \n \n The red outfit clings to every inch of you, tight across your chest, dipping low at the neckline. You imagine how you look from behind. From where Gordon is standing.\n\n \n\n For the next hour, Gordon puts you through your paces. His instructions are clear, his feedback blunt but never cruel. He calls out your mistakes, praises your form when you manage it. He doesn’t leer, but his eyes are still there.\n\n \n\n And every movement draws attention to your clothing. You watch yourself in the mirror when you can. Your top seems cut low, leaning in showing a view of your chest. And the leggings hug your bum cheeks, outlining your crack clearly. \n\n \n\n You imagine how it must look. How you must look. And with each anxious sight of your breasts or bum, you remember that you chose this outfit. You can’t help but notice the flutter when Gordon glances at you.\n \n \n \n \n The black outfit feels heavier now. Glossy straps press against your shoulders; the snug collar rests just below your throat. You glance toward Gordon, but he doesn’t leer. He doesn’t say anything at all.\n\n \n\n For the next hour, Gordon puts you through your paces. His instructions are clear, his feedback blunt but never cruel. He calls out your mistakes, praises your form when you manage it. He doesn’t leer, but his eyes are still there.\n\n \n\n The outfit doesn’t let you forget what you’re wearing for a moment. As you exercise you feel your breath constricted by the collar. The straps press into your skin like harnesses. You struggle to perform even the most basic of requests by Gordon.\n\n \n\n He watches you carefully. A frown on his face as you gasp for breath. You find yourself having to consciously listen more closely to Gordon’s voice to understand. Waiting for praise when you manage to do something. Trying not to disappoint in spite of your stamina. \n\n \n\n *Since when did you care about pleasing him?*\n \n \n \n \n The pastel pink clings to your chest and hips with frilled edges that bounce slightly as you walk. The bow at your waist sits impossibly centred. Gordon’s expression doesn’t change as he eyes your stance.\n\n \n\n For the next hour, Gordon puts you through your paces. His instructions are clear, his feedback blunt but never cruel. He calls out your mistakes, praises your form when you manage it. He doesn’t leer, but his eyes are still there.\n\n \n\n You struggle with the most basic of reps. But instead of grimacing, you find yourself giggling. You glance at yourself in the mirror, clad in pink and frills. You smile at the reflection of the girl trying to even comprehend how to do exercise, and tittering when she drops a weight.\n\n \n\n Gordon continues to direct you, but you find yourself ignoring his instructions. Instead, your gaze keeps returning to the mirror. Looking at how you look. How your body glows in this outfit. How perky you look in it. Your brain seems to reject any other thoughts, but worse, this feels normal.\n \n \n \n\n He calls the next set. You reposition yourself, your reflection waiting in the mirror again. Emily looks back at you, but already the mirror feels uncanny. You can’t help but watch yourself.\n\n \n\n Yet somewhere in the back of your mind, you wonder whether Gordon is watching too. Whether he’s judging. Or enjoying.\n\n \n\n *Or how about, why do you care?*\n \n \n Whilst you’ve been in the locker room, Gordon has been setting up for the exercise session. He’s placed a bench on the mats in front of the mirror and carefully placed a number of dumbbells to the side. You note how small they are. And how pink they're coloured, too.\n\n \n\n \n \n “Ready?” Gordon says, making some final adjustments to his preparations. As far as you can tell, he doesn’t react to the red outfit that clings like a second skin. As you take your place on the mat, you’re acutely aware of how exposed you look.\n\n \n\n “Let’s begin,” he says, after one last minute change to one of the weights. “First set. Lunges.”\n\n \n\n For the next hour Gordon puts you through your paces, encouraging you when you need it, praising you when you push yourself, calling you out when you take it easy. He doesn't belittle you or put you down, even when you make mistakes.\n\n \n\n Even these small weights cause you to strain, but you take comfort in the fact you've kept your body flexible and nimble. You easily stretch and arch when Gordon asks it of you.\n\n \n\n But every movement draws attention to your curves. In the mirror, your neckline dips with each forward bend. The leggings don’t just cling. Even when you’re not leaning over, you see in the mirror the clear shape of your arse crack. And this set seems defined to make you bend, a lot.\n\n \n \n \n “Ready?” Gordon says, making some final adjustments to his preparations. As far as you can tell, he doesn’t react to the matte fabric that hugs you tightly. The collar feels snug against your throat.\n\n \n\n “Let’s begin,” he says, after one last minute change to one of the weights. “First set. Lunges.”\n\n \n\n For the next hour Gordon puts you through your paces, encouraging you when you need it, praising you when you push yourself, calling you out when you take it easy. He doesn't belittle you or put you down, even when you make mistakes.\n\n \n\n Even these small weights cause you to strain, but you take comfort in the fact you've kept your body flexible and nimble. You easily stretch and arch when Gordon asks it of you.\n \n \n\n Yet the snugness of the outfit makes it harder to breathe. You move, but the fabric restricts you. You find yourself having to listen to Gordon’s voice more than you're used to, trying to follow his direction to the letter. He watches you carefully, eyes narrowing as the collar restricts your breath.\n \n \n \n “Ready?” Gordon says, making some final adjustments to his preparations. As far as you can tell, he doesn’t react to the frills that bounce with each step you take toward the mat. The outfit makes you feel vapid, but you catch yourself smiling at your reflection all the same.\n\n \n\n “Let’s begin,” he says, after one last minute change to one of the weights. “First set. Lunges.”\n\n \n\n For the next hour Gordon puts you through your paces, encouraging you when you need it, praising you when you push yourself, calling you out when you take it easy. He doesn't belittle you or put you down, even when you make mistakes.\n\n \n\n Even these small weights cause you to strain, but you take comfort in the fact you've kept your body flexible and nimble. You easily stretch and arch when Gordon asks it of you.\n \n \n\n Although you find yourself tripping constantly. You can barely hold form, but for some reason you don’t mind. The frills shake, the bow shifts, and your reflection giggles. Gordon continues calmly as he offers corrections, but you let your mind drift. Watching your body bounce. Smiling when you get something wrong.\n\n \n \n\n He continues to give you instructions and you drop into the rhythm of following his guidance. He watches you without expression, giving you tips and advice with short, concise statements. He doesn’t come close to you, instead observing you from off-the-mat. Even so, something stirs in you when you think about how you're following his words, obeying his direction, whilst his eyes focus on your body as you move.\n\n \n\n “Don’t lean forward,” Gordon tells you, as you drop into a squat. “Flatten your back.”\n\n \n\n You glance over your shoulder, looking at the muscular man.

He walks back over to the weight lifting machine and starts prepping for another set. Feeling a tinge of embarrassment upon seeing the preparation he’s made for your workout, you decide to leave.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "You follow Gordon’s instruction and step into a lunge, but tilt your hips slightly more than needed. As your front leg bends, you feel the shorts ride up just a little further.\n\n \n\n Catching your reflection in the mirror, you see a flash of bum cheek as you bend at the waist. You hold the pose longer than necessary and a smile curls on your lips when you see that Gordon has noticed too. \n\n \n\n He calls the next set. You move slowly and deliberately. Leaning forward towards the mirror just enough your reflection shows a view down your top to him. You remember how Annie would lean and she’d smile over her shoulder without trying. You find yourself doing the same, looking back at him, biting your lip.\n\n \n\n Gordon's face doesn’t change, but you see his eyes lingering on the woman in the mirror. You’ve had that look on your face looking at Annie before. But the difference this time is the person in the mirror is now you. The young woman, flaunting her body and flashing private areas barely contained by the revealing clothing. How far would you go if he told you to do more?\n\n \n\n “Enough,” Gordon says, voice low but firm. “We’re done for today.”\n\n \n\n You blink. The moment breaks. You rise from your pose, adjusting the top as subtly as you can. Gordon is already re-racking the weights, his eyes unreadable.\n\n \n\n You glance up at the clock on the wall and note that it seems like a short session. You wonder if you made the right decision with him. You nod, and head back to the locker room to get changed.\n \n \n You follow Gordon’s advice and lean backward, but take the opportunity to further push your bum out. Facing back away from him, you can easily picture what Jennifer looks like from behind. Except in this instance, it’s you.\n\n \n\n Gordon continues to instruct you in different exercises to try and poses to drop into. Instead of focusing on the exercise though, your mind turns to how you can use it to emphasise your body. With each new stance a singular thought drifts through your head. Does this make me look sexy?\n\n \n\n You begin to watch Gordon and yourself in the full length mirror in front of you. Objectively, you see Jennifer, bent over in various poses, obeying a muscular gym bro as he tells her what to do. You notice the smile on her face as she pushes out her bum, and arches her back to emphasise her breasts. Gordon's face doesn’t change, but you see his eyes lingering on her form.\n\n \n\n But that person in the mirror is you. The young woman, showing off her curves and features to the instructor, obeying his commands. How far would you go if he told you to do more?\n\n \n\n “That’s enough,” Gordon suddenly says, bringing you back from your daydreams. “Time for you to go.”\n\n \n\n You pull out of your pose and stand, facing him. He is emotionless, but has his arms crossed. “We’re done for today.”\n\n \n\n You glance up at the clock on the wall and note that it seems like a short session. You wonder if you made the right decision with him. You nod, and head back to the locker room to get changed. \n\n \n You step into your next pose slowly, letting your hips sway more than needed. You lean into the movement, exaggerating the arch of your back, letting your chest lead. Your eyes flick to the mirror, watching yourself. Watching Emily.\n\n \n\n \n \n The top dips low enough that even small adjustments show off the curve of your breasts. You stretch higher, push deeper, knowing the outfit frames every inch of you.\n\n \n\n You meet your own gaze in the mirror, eyes wide, lips parted. It’s not hard to imagine the effect you’ll have on Gordon as he watches.\n\n \n\n But the voice that interrupts you is calm. “Don’t need to flaunt to impress real men,” Gordon says, as he leans close to your face. His words land without edge. And there’s almost compassion behind his eyes.\n\n \n\n You straighten instinctively, pulse still fluttering from the way you’d been moving. But Gordon’s already turning away, adjusting weights and calling out reps for you.\n\n \n \n \n The collar presses tight as you lower yourself again, your breath catching slightly. You let it show. Deliberately so. The thought of restraint and being guided swirls in your head.\n\n \n\n You exaggerate the tension, letting your hands tremble a little. But when you glance at Gordon, he’s watching with a frown.\n\n \n\n “Girls don’t need to be tied up for real men,” he says flatly. \n\n \n\n Your hand goes up to the collar instinctively, but Gordon doesn’t say another word. He moves back to the rack and continues to call out instructions for you.\n\n \n \n \n You bounce slightly as you move, letting the frills dance. The weight slips and you squeal a high, girlish giggle bubbling out of you. You feel the impish grin forming on your face as a quick follow.\n\n \n\n When you look up, Gordon is already staring. His brow furrows. “Don’t act dumb just because you think it’s cute,” he says. “Real men shouldn’t like that.”\n\n \n\n Your smile fades, but Gordon doesn’t say another word. He returns to the session, tapping on the dumbbells off to the side of the mat.\n\n \n \n\n After a few more reps, Gordon leans back against the weight machine. “That’s enough. We’re done for today.”\n\n \n\n You pull out of your pose and stand, facing him. He is emotionless, but has his arms crossed. You glance up at the clock on the wall and note that it seems like a short session. You wonder if you made the right decision with him. You nod, and head back to the locker room to get changed.\n\n \n You step forward into a lunge, slow and deliberate, letting your front knee dip lower than needed. Your hips tilt as you settle into the pose, pushing your bum out just slightly further than is required.\n\n \n\n \n \n The scoop of the top plunges with every breath, the slick fabric gleaming as you stretch. You arch deliberately into each motion, aware of how your chest rises and how the leggings hug your backside. You pause longer between reps, adjusting your stance just so.\n\n \n\n You catch Gordon’s reflection in the mirror. He hasn’t said a word. But his eyes flick. Just for a second.\n\n \n \n \n The collar itches against your neck, firm and snug. The glossy straps cinch your waist, framing your figure in a way that feels contained. You begin a new set, struggling slightly with the tension in your neck.\n\n \n\n Gordon steps in. “This. Is a problem,” he mutters, nodding toward the collar.\n\n \n\n His hand reaches towards it, but holds inches from it as his eyes meet yours. Waiting. Instinctively, you give him the smallest of nods. He slides a rough finger underneath the collar, wiggling in a gap you would have bet money wouldn’t be possible. \n\n \n\n “Doesn’t seem tight enough,” he mutters, and keeping your eyes looking up at him, he pulls at it, constricting your windpipe to a pinprick.\n\n \n\n Gordon doesn’t grin, instead just watching you struggle for air. Only a second passes before he lets go, but you gasp all the same. “Better?” he murmurs\n\n \n\n Then he’s gone. Back to the rack. Back to indifference. But something lingers in your throat and it’s not just the tenderness from his grasp.\n\n \n \n \n The frills flutter with every movement. The top shifts easily, riding up at the hem with every stretch. You bend into a pose and peek at yourself in the mirror. Your bum sticks out, the bow bobbing at your waistline.\n\n \n\n A giggle comes before you realise it. A real giggle. Then you do it again. Just for the sound of it.\n\n \n\n You see yourself in the mirror. Pink, sweet, on display. And you hold the pose longer than you should, biting your lip, watching yourself more than Gordon. It takes seconds between each pose for you to remember what you are doing, and glance back at Gordon giggling as you bend and arch your back.\n\n \n \n\n “Enough,” he says quickly. “We’re done for today. Time for you to go.”\n\n \n\n You pull out of your pose and stand, facing him. He is emotionless, but has his arms crossed. You glance up at the clock on the wall and note that it seems like a short session. You wonder if you made the right decision with him. You nod, and head back to the locker room to get changed.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n You drop into the lunge Gordon asked for, adjusting your stance until it feels stable. The shorts ride up again, but this time you ignore it. You focus on your balance. Your form. Your breath.\n\n \n\n Gordon continues the session with quiet, firm instruction. You listen to each cue and obey, adjusting your posture, bracing your core, extending through your arms and legs. You feel the burn almost immediately. Annie’s body might be eye-catching, but it’s not built for strength.\n\n \n\n Your legs tremble as you lower into squats. Your arms ache as you push through curls. Sweat beads along your back. There’s no time to think about what you look like. You focus on getting through each step and pose before you collapse. \n\n \n\n “Control your breathing,” Gordon says as you grip the dumbbells again. You nod, lips parted, lungs straining. \n\n \n\n Slowly, each muscle seems to gather reserve energy. Gordon’s instruction becomes easier to follow. Only then do you dare look in the mirror. Seeing it reflecting a woman pushing herself. \n\n \n\n “Enough,” Gordon finally says, folding his arms. “Good session.”\n\n \n\n You lower the weights slowly and breathe in deep. Your chest rises and falls as you steady yourself.\n\n \n\n “Better than expected,” he adds, tossing you a towel.\n\n \n\n You catch it, nodding your thanks.\n\n \n You take his advice to heart, leaning back and stretching your back. You feel your bones cracking, but you take solace in the discomfort. You feel you are getting somewhere.\n\n \n\n Gordon continues to instruct you through different exercises. You focus on each pose he tells you to take up, stretching your arms and legs further and longer than you could have even done as you. \n\n \n\n The weights feel heavier than anything you’ve lifted before, and your muscles twitch from the workout. Sweat runs down your head and you listen as your breath turns into pants. \n\n \n\n \"And relax,\" he says to you, after the final set on his plan. You take several deep breaths, short of oxygen. Your body aches, but you have to admit, you feel better.\n\n \n\n \"Good work.” Gordon says. \"See you next time.\"\n\n \n\n You thank him. Even though you feel tired, you feel limber.\n\n \n\n With your exercise complete, you have a moment to talk to Gordon, as he offers you a towel.\n\n \n You drop into the pose Gordon instructed, focusing on alignment rather than appearance. The mirror reflects every angle, but you resist the urge to check yourself. Not this time.\n\n \n\n Gordon keeps his tone neutral, but his attention sharpens. He corrects your stance with short, precise directions. “Lower. Back straight. Feet apart.” You follow them. \n\n \n\n The dumbbells are light, but this body tires fast. Your breath shortens as sweat gathers at your lower back. The tightness of your outfit makes every motion feel like more effort than it should be, but you press on.\n\n \n\n “Keep going,” Gordon says. There’s a change in his tone. Almost encouraging. His eyes are now fixed on you, but not in a leering or lecherous way. Almost as if encouraging you to succeed.\n\n \n\n You stretch again, holding the posture until your arms tremble. Gordon nods, watching you. Still no smile, but he seems invested in you.\n\n \n\n When you finish the final set, your arms are shaking and your chest is rising and falling. You step back, exhausted, but a little proud.\n\n \n\n Gordon nods. “Good.” He tosses you a towel.\n\n \n\n He studies you for a moment longer. “That outfit. Too flashy. Not enough support,” he says. “Wish Evans' had better options.”\n\n He studies you for a moment longer. “That outfit. Too restrictive. Cuts blood flow,” he says. “Wish Evans' had better options.”\n\n He studies you for a moment longer. “That outfit. Too frilly. Gets in the way,” he says. “Wish Evans' had better options.”\n \n \n\n You nod, towel in hand. You’re tired. But you feel seen and for more than your body. \n\n \n You take his advice to heart, leaning back and stretching your back. You feel your bones cracking, but you take solace in the discomfort. You feel you are getting somewhere.\n\n \n\n Gordon continues to instruct you through different exercises. You focus on each pose he tells you to take up, stretching your arms and legs further and longer than you could have even done as you. \n\n \n\n The weights feel heavy and your muscles twitch from the workout. Sweat runs down your head and you listen as your breath turns into panting.\n\n \n\n \"And relax,\" he says to you, after the final set on his plan. You take several deep breaths, short of oxygen. Your body aches, but you have to admit, you feel better.\n\n \n\n \"Good work.” Gordon says. Only then does he call attention to your outfit, with a raised eyebrow. “That’s flashy,” he says. “Doesn’t help with form.”\n\n \"Good work.” Gordon says. Only then does he call attention to your outfit, with a raised eyebrow. “That’ll restrict airflow,” he mutters. “Not practical.”\n\n \"Good work.” Gordon says. Only then does he call attention to your outfit, with a raised eyebrow. “That’s a lot of frills,” he says, turning away. “Hard to focus dressed like that.”\n \n \n\n You look at him for a follow-up, but he says nothing more. Faced with an awkward silence, you thank him. Even though you feel tired, you feel limber.\n\n \n\n With your exercise complete, you have a moment to talk to Gordon, as he offers you a towel.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Casey's Gym**\n\n [image: ./images/Gym.png]\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n You step back out onto the gym floor, Annie’s sneakers squeaking faintly against the polished mats. Every pair of eyes seem to lock on you. The girls outside the glass stare, lips curling in envy. Even Casey, lounging at the desk with a cigarette, tilts his head up. He smirks as he takes a slow drag, watching you.\n\n \n\n Jake is no different as you approach him. His eyes track down and back up your body. “Damn,” he says with a grin, “Bet you’d look even better without it, though.” \n\n \n\n The words are as subtle as a sledgehammer, but they still cause a little flutter in your chest. What exactly the amulet has done to you to make even that feel nice?\n\n \n You step back out onto the gym floor. All eyes seem to turn toward you, but the reaction is muted. The girls outside the window watch you, whispering constantly at the sight of you. Casey looks up from the desk, his gaze measured. You feel like you're walking into a saloon bar in a western.\n\n \n\n Jake leans against the nearest machine, his gaze tracking you. “Looking good,\" he says with a twinge of hesitation.\n \n \n You step back out onto the gym floor, not eliciting much of a reaction. Casey doesn’t even glance up from his boxing magazine and the girls continue to chatter, oblivious to your presence.\n\n \n\n Jake does notice, though. His grin comes quick. “That colour’s asking for trouble, nerd. You show up in that, you better be ready to back it up.”\n\n Jake does notice, though. His grin comes quick. “Interesting look, nerd. That collar got an owner yet? I'd like to apply.”\n\n Jake does notice, though. His grin comes quick. \"Pink frills? Looks like you’re here to shake pom-poms, not lift weights.”\n\n \n You step back out onto the gym floor, the mat under your shoes giving a faint, tacky squeak. It's subtle, but you see heads lifting. Casey actually looks up from his magazine with a slow look before he flips the page. The girls outside lean in a little closer to the window, watching you with narrowed eyes as you approach Jake.\n\n \n\n He gives you a wolfish grin and whistles, but says nothing. His eyes linger and he regards you with hunger.\n\n He smirks as he sees your workout gear, eyes returning to the collar around your neck. \"Huh,\" he spits, but offers nothing more.\n\n He lets out a slow and mocking low whistle. \"Going through a barbie phase?\" he quips.\n\n \n \n\n Jake slaps his hands together. “Alright, here’s the deal. Three rounds. First’s the thigh press. Thirty reps, sixty seconds, see if you can keep your legs from shaking. Then bent-over rows, so I can check your form. Real close. And last, chest flys on the cables. You'll need to show your best if you want my money. But win two out of three and you can walk out with it.”\n\n \n\n \"And if I lose?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n He grins. \"I reckon the show's going to be reward enough. For everyone.\"\n\n \n\n His eyes betray him as he glances over at the window, where you see the girls outside still watching. You know Jake wouldn’t set this up without there being something in it for him, but you can't quite see what it is yet. What you do know is that those girls are somehow involved.\n\n \n\n Jake steps back and sweeps a hand toward the first machine. “Let’s go. Show me what you’ve got.” \n\n \n\n Your pulse jumps as you move into position, all eyes still locked on you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You step back onto the gym floor, glancing around as you walk in. It's as you left it. Casey's at the counter, reading a magazine. The girls outside are staring back through the window glass. And Jake is already rolling his shoulders, chest out, eyes flicking between you and his reflection in the mirror, which the girls appear to be watching intently.\n\n \n\n “Alright, big man. Three rounds. First one’s a sprint drill. Three hundred metres, increasing incline. You think you can keep up?”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t wait for an answer before gesturing over his shoulder toward the pull-up bar. “Second, we go upper body. Twenty-five clean reps.\" Then he tips his head toward the bench stacked with plates. “Last’s the lift. Heavy as it gets. Win two out of three and you can walk out with my money.”\n\n \n\n You glance over at the equipment, then back to him. \"And if I lose?\"\n\n \n\n Jake flashes a quick look toward the girls outside, making sure you notice his look. \"'I'll get a nice reward.\"\n\n \n\n He smacks his hands together, loud enough to make one of the girls jump. “Let’s do it.\"\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n \n Jake gestures toward the seated thigh press machine. “Thirty reps. Sixty seconds. All the way open, all the way closed. You up for that?”\n\n \n\n He slides a pin into the weight stack without asking your preference, setting it just heavy enough to burn by the end. You take your seat, sneakers planted on the floor, hands gripping the side bars.\n\n \n\n As the first rep spreads your legs wide, you catch movement in the corner of your eye. The girls outside are still glued to the glass, watching you.\n\n \n\n Jake stays close, counting down each rep with a lazy grin. His eyes drift over your body, lingering around your groin as you spread your legs with each rep. “One… two… further than that. Don’t be shy.”\n\n \n\n By halfway through, your thighs are burning. Jake’s eyes never leave you. He runs his tongue over his lips, flicking his eyes from your face to crotch, grinning. “C’mon, ten more. Show me what those legs can really do.”\n\n \n\n He steps forward, towering over you, perilously close to standing in the very spot where you are moving your legs through. Opening and closing. Spreading wide. Any closer and you’d clasp him between your thighs.\n\n \n \n Then you look to the window, catching the eyes of Jake's admirers gazing in. Spreading your legs wide once more in front of him, they offer you a glare.\n\n \n\n In spite of yourself, their glares get under your skin. You look back up at Jake as you close your legs again. Then open them. He runs his tongue between his teeth, staring at you.\n\n \n\n Your muscles are pulsing, making you doubt how much you have left to give. And glancing between Jake's lustful focus on your crotch and the hostile looks from the girls outside, an idea forms. There might be another way to get through this exercise other than winning it.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n Jake steps up to the treadmill beside you, tapping the display with a smug little grin. “Three hundred metres,” he says. “Try to keep up, old man. I don’t slow down for charity cases.”\n\n \n\n The belts whine to life and you launch into it, driving your legs hard. Jake keeps glancing your way, waiting for you to stumble.\n\n \n\n For the first hundred metres, you’re matching him stride for stride. Your pace is consistent and solid. You keep your breathing regular and controlled. But as the incline begins to rise, you feel your legs growing sore. The pace begins to get away from you.\n\n \n\n You glance over to Jake. He's suffering no such challenges. And as the two-hundred mark creeps up, the truth hits. This was a fool’s errand. You were never going to beat a quarterback at running. Whilst you are struggling to match the machine's pace, Jake is just finding his rhythm. The usual stream of jabs is gone. For once, he’s actually concentrating.\n\n \n\n But you catch the quick flick of his eyes toward the window. The girls are there, crowding the glass, watching the two of you with bright eyes. They lean in, whispering to each other, one of them covering a smile behind her hand. Jake seems to be trying to avoid paying attention to them.\n\n \n\n *Maybe you could use that? Psych him out? Throw him off his game.*\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n\n \n You lock your gaze on the machine’s padded grips, shutting out Jake’s stare and the girls’ daggered eyes. Every repetition burns, the muscles in your thighs trembling under the strain, but you embrace it.\n\n \n\n \n With resolve, you use your thighs to push your legs to their limit. They throb, but you push the desire to stop away. After all, you’re here to prove that you’re more than just a body to be ogled at or whispered about.\n\n \n\n Don’t you mean Annie is more than that?\n\n \n Your own body feels like it’s pushing with you, every muscle straining not just to finish. Images of the girls at the window flash up in your mind. You grit your teeth, dismissing them. This isn't about giving a show to Jake, but it’s also not about whatever those girls outside might be whispering. It’s about proving you can do it. That you’re more than the small-town gossip says you are.\n\n \n\n *That sounded a lot like Jen. Not you.*\n\n \n The padded plates press against your thighs as you drive them outward, muscles burning with each repetition. You grit your teeth. Despite what he thinks, you’re not here to entertain him. You’re here to prove you’re more than just someone to look at.\n\n \n\n The snug fabric stretches with every press, clinging to your sweaty breasts and thighs. But every ounce of additional effort turns the outfit away from something to emphasise your body and more celebrate the physicality of your muscles.\n\n The straps bite into your skin with each rep, metal clasps shifting under the strain. It’s a constant reminder that this outfit was built to restrain, not assist. And yet, each push feels like proof you can work against it.\n\n The soft trim and bows almost feel delicate and flimsy under the duress, as if at any point they could tear. Not even the threat of this concerns you, as you push harder to show that you aren't defined by a colour.\n\n \n\n By the time you hit the final rep, your legs feel like lead. Jake stands over you, eyebrows raised, a crooked grin fighting with something closer to frustration.\n\n \n\n “Not bad,” he says after a beat. “That was just a warm-up, though.” But you catch the faintest flicker in his eyes. A sliver of unease, as if maybe he’s misjudged you.\n\n \n \n Through the glass, the girls are no longer whispering or smirking. They just watch, lips pressed together, the edges of their jealousy softening into something else. Curiosity, maybe.\n\n \n \n The sight of the girls eyeing Jake sparks a fire deep inside you. A caveman urge, maybe. But strong all the same. You want that attention. That desire. And you’ll do anything to take it from him.\n\n \n\n Your stride lengthens, muscles screaming, but you don’t let up. Every glance at Jake only feeds it. The flicker of surprise in his eyes as you keep pace. His grin even tightens into something harder when you edge ahead.\n\n \n\n The belt whines under the pressure of your sprint. The counter ticks closer to the mark, and with one last surge you cross first, breath tearing at your chest. Jake slaps his stop button a beat later. His jaw works as he forces a smirk, but his eyes are sharper now as a flash of a competitive glare before he hides it.\n\n \n\n “Just a warm-up, old man,” he says, voice low but edged. “Don’t get cocky.”\n\n \n\n You stand tall, still hammering with adrenaline, lungs dragging in greedy gulps of air. Heat floods your veins, testosterone surging as you drink in the moment. You can’t help but grin at the girls now. One of them looks away from your glance, coyly, as if she wasn’t watching you. It’s enough to spike the rush even higher.\n\n \n\n *Yes. It feels good, doesn’t it.*\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n You grit your teeth and try to force another rep. At first, you think you can keep the pace, but before the halfway mark the burn turns molten. Your breath comes faster, legs trembling, and every press feels heavier than the last. The machine starts clapping shut faster as your form falters.\n\n \n\n Jake watches the struggle like he’s been waiting for it. His grin stretches slow across his face, satisfaction settling into his eyes. You glance up at him and his look is enough to strip your resolve. The next attempt dies halfway. You slump back in the seat, chest rising and falling, legs left loose and open.\n\n \n\n \"That's what I thought,\" Jake says, taking a step forward, his shadow falling over you. Before you realise, he's standing between your spread legs. Then he plants one foot on the bench between your legs. You feel his trainer push against your crotch, your slit tingling through the fabric of your clothes.\n\n \n\n \n “You might be good at keeping your legs open, Annie,” he whispers. \"But it takes a man to know how to use the muscles in them.”\n\n \n “What’s the matter?\" he asks. \"Gordon not giving you enough action? Looks like those thighs have gone soft.”\n\n “What’s the matter?\" he asks. \"Boyfriend not giving you enough of a workout? Looks like those thighs have gone soft.”\n\n \n “Just what I expected,\" he murmurs. \"Flashy doesn’t mean fit, sweetheart.”\n\n “Just what I expected,\" he murmurs. \"All strapped up and all for nothing.”\n\n “Just what I expected,\" he murmurs. \"Guess bows make up for muscle, after all.”\n\n \n \n\n Then he leans in over you, bringing his face close to yours, flexing his exposed thigh that's inches from your face. He glances back to the window, grinning at the girls, flexing as he stands over your defeated form. Another brush from his shoe against your crotch sends shivers across your body. You become conscious of your position, legs spread, pinned down on the exercise machine by the brute looming over you. And he's using your submission and defeat to impress his admirers.\n\n \n \n Your eyes flick to the window. The girls outside are laughing, heads tipped together, their amusement loud even through the glass.\n\n \n\n After a moment, Jake withdraws. \"Next set,\" he barks, embracing his role as an instructor.\n\n \n You lock your eyes on the console, telling yourself you can win this honestly. No games, no cheap shots. Just run. The belt hums under your shoes as you drive your knees high, stride for stride with Jake. But your calves are starting to burn. The incline bites deeper with every step.\n\n \n\n Jake’s breathing stays maddeningly smooth. He begins to edge ahead. A fraction at first, then a few steps more. You try to keep your form clean, but the gap only widens.\n\n \n\n His treadmill chimes first. He rides the belt for a heartbeat, then hops off in one fluid motion, turning toward the glass. Stretching into a long, deliberate lunge, he makes sure every line of muscle in his thighs is on display.\n\n \n\n “Looks like you’ve been spending too much time running in skirts, Phillips,” he quips. The comment is addressed to you, but his voice is loud enough for the girls outside to hear. You glance over and see them laughing.\n\n \n\n You try to tell yourself it’s just Jake’s usual trash talk, nothing more. But it stings. Perhaps even more than he expected.\n\n \n\n After a moment, Jake turns back to you. \"Next set,\" he barks, grinning wildly.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You let your thighs part, slow and deliberate, the padded plates of the machine groaning slightly as the motion widens. And then stop. Deliberately, you look up at Jake, holding his gaze for a long moment before his eyes drop to between your thighs. When you look up you see his grin is gone, replaced by a frown of curiosity and confusion.\n\n \n\n You hold the position, keeping your legs wide. There's a silence as you remain still. Cautiously, Jake takes a step forward into the arc of your thighs. When you don't flinch, he puts one hand on the machine and lifts a leg to plant his foot on the bench between your own. But he slips, almost falling on to you. There's a flicker of embarrassment for a moment as he rights himself. \n\n \n \n \"Hell, you keep them open like that, and I'll forget what I'm counting for,” he says, his voice pitched low. His gaze drags down to staring at your crotch, then back to your face. Shameless, you still don’t move.\n\n \n\n \"Are we done?\" you murmur.\n\n \n\n Jake tilts his head, smirking like he’s sizing up a prize he already owns. “Yeah. That’s plenty. Keep that up, and maybe I’ll throw in something extra.”\n\n \n\n It's one comment, but you feel it land. Something inside you stirs, as you consider what he must be seeing. A woman, shamelessly spreading her legs wide open for his sight. You can all too easily imagine what he must be thinking. For some reason, it brings you a spark to indulge it.\n\n \n \n Trying to forget the thought, you glance past him to the window. The girls’ glares are sharp enough to cut, burning with pure jealousy. You’ve won this round, and they know it.\n\n \n\n *But at what cost?*\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You keep your knees high, stride for stride with him, the treadmills thrumming in sync. Sweat beads at your brow, but your grin is steady as you glance over, already weighing how to knock him off balance without breaking stride.\n\n \n\n “Not bad for a school kid,” you say, breath steady.\n\n \n\n Jake smirks. “Better than being an old man.”\n\n \n\n You glance over at Jake’s machine. His distance is pulling ahead of yours. Grimacing, you try again. “You date Christina, right? Athletic. Does she go easy on you when you run?”\n\n \n\n That gets a bark of a laugh. “Jealous I’m dating a real cheerleader? Your girl couldn’t cut it, could she?”\n\n \n\n Looking at Jake’s machine, you lament as the counter stretches away. You grit your teeth, legs pumping harder. “She’s on the tall side, though, isn’t she?”\n\n \n\n For the first time his eyes flick to meet yours. “What?” he mutters.\n\n \n\n *Bingo.* You press the blade in. “Bet she loves that. Looking down while you’re looking up.”\n\n \n\n His stride falters. His eyes glare over at you. “Shut up,” he says, quietly.\n\n \n\n You can’t help but smirk. “How does it feel when she wears heels?” you continue. \"Do you feel a bit... like a girl?\"\n\n \n\n Jake’s heel catches the belt. He stumbles, grabs the rail, then the treadmill spits him off the back.\n\n \n\n You hammer the last fifty metres, your machine chiming the win.\n\n \n\n Jake straightens, red-faced, pretending to check something on the console. Behind the glass, the girls laugh openly, one miming his trip while the other leans against the window, shaking her head.\n\n \n\n For a second you think he might take a swing. You square your stance. But he exhales sharply. “Whatever. That was just a warm-up.” But the usual swagger isn’t there.\n\n \n\n *Yes. Show him who’s boss.*\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n Jake kicks a pair of dumbbells into place at your feet, the clang echoing against the mirrored wall. “Bent-over rows. Ten reps. Proper posture. I’ll watch your alignment.”\n\n \n\n You curl your fingers around the cold iron and bend at the hips, lowering until your back is parallel to the floor. In the mirror, your reflection meets your own gaze. You see yourself bent over at the waist, breasts close to falling out of your top, arse high in the air.\n\n \n\n Movement at the side of the mirror catches your eye. You see in the reflection the girls are giggling, hands over their mouths. You don’t need to imagine what they're seeing.\n\n \n\n “Go on,” Jake says from behind you, voice low.\n\n \n\n You start to lift the weights off the floor. The pull is heavy, your arms straining as you bring the weights toward your ribs.\n\n \n\n “Legs straight,” Jake instructs. “Back arched. Tooshie sticking up. No slacking. No cheating.”\n\n \n\n In the mirror's reflection, you watch him draw closer. So close you can almost feel the warmth of him at your rear. His hands slide onto your hips, guiding and tilting you back until your bum brushes his hips. You feel the pressure of his dick through the thin layer of your clothes.\n\n \n\n The weights drag at your arms, your posture trembling under the strain. His nearness makes it worse, causing every rep to feel like a battle to keep form and focus. Like this, you know you’ll never finish the set.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n Jake leads you toward the far wall, where a pull-up bar gleams under the strip lights. He stops beneath it, rolls his shoulders, and tosses you a look that’s all challenge.\n\n \n\n “Twenty-five. Clean reps. No kicking.” His tone says he’s already decided you won’t match him.\n\n \n\n The glass wall is behind you, and in its reflection you catch the girls drifting closer. Some lean against the frame, others fold their arms, smirking like they’re here for a sure thing. Jake gives them the barest nod before jumping to the bar.\n\n \n\n You take your place beside him, palms biting against the metal. At his count, you both start.\n\n \n\n The first few reps are easy, but Jake’s already pulling ahead. His chin clears the bar in sharp, quick motions. But there’s something about his rhythm. Just a fraction too quick for the reps to be as clean as he’s making them look.\n\n \n\n By the seventh pull, your forearms are warm and your breath is deeper. Yet Jake looks like he’s just warming up. He even flicks to the window to check his audience before dropping back into the next rep. One girl leans forward, biting her lip. Another tilts her head toward him with a grin.\n\n \n\n Your own count lags. The metal feels slicker now, your grip needing adjustment each time you drop.\n\n \n\n “C’mon, old man,” Jake says between breaths. “Don’t gas out on me now.\"\n\n \n\n You can feel the burn in your shoulders. Without doing something, he’ll hit twenty-five while you’re still in the teens. You can tell there's something in the way that he's moving that gives him an advantage. If only you could figure out what it is.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n The touch and the closeness of Jake is suffocating. You feel his hands on your hips and see his smirk in the glass.\n\n \n\n On the next rep, you bend forward just a fraction further than necessary, giving the weight a subtle backswing. You release your grip and the dumbbell flies back, landing on his foot with a solid, satisfying thud. \"Sorry!\" you exclaim.\n\n \n\n Jake’s grip vanishes instantly. His smile dissipates as he yelps and he hops back, clutching his shoe. “Son of a -!”\n\n \n\n He glares back at you in the mirror, but says nothing. As he tries to stand, you can see him limping. His usual swagger ruined.\n\n \n\n You flick a glance to the window reflected in the mirror. The girls are giggling, but now their eyes are looking at him.\n\n \n\n *Nice work. That will teach him.*\n\n \n\n Jake slumps onto a nearby bench, rubbing at his foot and muttering curses. Without his hands on you, the rest of the set comes easy. You row each rep in perfect form, the burn in your back clean and unbroken by distraction.\n\n \n\n By the time you finish, he’s still massaging his toes. “Well done,” he mutters under his breath, almost too low to hear, the words swallowed up in another grimace as he shifts his weight.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You tighten your grip on the dumbbells, spine straightening against the pull of the weight. Jake’s hands continue to hold on to your hips, steadying you. Or claiming you.\n\n \n\n You know what he wants. So you give it to him.\n\n \n\n As you lift the weights, you arch your spine just a little more, letting your hips roll back into his. The motion is subtle at first, but you feel the contact. Jake stiffens behind you. His fingers flex against your hips, but he doesn’t pull away.\n\n \n\n You push back further with each additional rep, setting into a rhythm. When lifting the weights, you grind down. And when lowering, you grind back up against him.\n\n \n \n “That’s better,” Jake mutters low. His grip relents, letting you move freely. You feel him push back against you, his groin meeting your arse separated only by your clothing.\n\n \n\n You glance up, looking at him in the mirror. His smirk is gone. Instead, he's staring at the reflection of the pair of you. And you watch yourself as you roll your butt against him, chest exposed as your top hangs low.\n\n \n\n From the corner mirror you also see the girls outside. You can’t hear them through the glass, but their faces say enough. Whispers, widened eyes, half-hidden smirks. They know what this looks like. They know exactly what you’re doing.\n\n \n\n And you don’t stop. Instead, you let the dumbbells touch the floor and let the pretense of doing the exercise set evaporate.\n\n \n\n By the time you stop grinding against him, Jake's expression in the mirror is one of astonishment. He wears a grin that is slack and loose. His hand lingers a moment longer on your hip before sliding away.\n\n \n\n “You did fine,” he says, voice rough, but clearly distracted.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n A shiver crawls your spine. You twist sharply, wrenching yourself out of his grip. “Hands off. I don’t need you touching me.”\n\n \n\n For a heartbeat, surprise flickers across his face. Then the grin returns, smug as ever. “Relax. Just trying to help with your form.” He steps back, leaning against the wall with folded arms. “Go on, then. Show me how it’s done.”\n\n \n\n You set your stance again and pull. The weights bite into your palms, your back burning as you fight for each rep. But without his grip steadying you - however unwanted - your body wavers. The mirror shows every tremble in your shoulders, every falter in your legs.\n\n \n\n By the sixth rep your form collapses. You let the dumbbells fall with a clatter, chest heaving, sweat damp on your brow.\n\n \n\n Jake’s voice cuts in, pitched loud enough to carry through the glass. “Guess that’s all you’ve got.” His smirk never leaves the mirror, his eyes flicking between you and the girls outside.\n\n \n\n The girls are laughing now, hands cupped to mouths, delighted at the spectacle. Their jeers sting more than the ache in your arms.\n\n \n\n You stand upright, cheeks flushed but gaze steady. You didn’t finish, but you didn’t let him put his hands on you either. The small defiance lingers. A fragile ember of control, even as Jake shakes his head like you’ve proven him right.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You tighten your grip, teeth gritted. Jake’s rhythm is just too fast, too smooth for twenty-five strict reps. Then you catch it. The faint swing in his hips. The little kick of momentum hidden in the drop. He’s not pulling clean. He’s kipping.\n\n \n\n A grin slips across your face. *Two can play at that game.*\n\n \n\n You shift your own motion, shoulders loose on the drop, swinging just enough to snap back up. It immediately shaves the edge off the burn.\n\n \n\n Your reps even out, with your chin clearing the bar in the same sharp rhythm Jake is keeping. His eyes flick sideways, but for once says nothing.\n\n \n\n The count climbs. Sweat runs hot down your back. You haul the last rep with everything left in your arms, chin snapping over the bar just as Jake falters on his. His feet scrape the mat a second before yours hit the floor.\n\n \n\n You’ve won. By a breath, but you’ve won.\n\n \n\n Jake wipes his palms on his shorts, jaw set hard. “Not clean,” he mutters, but doesn't elaborate. He glances to the window, but then turns away quickly. You look over to see the girls looking in, but their eyes are on you.\n\n \n\n *Doesn’t it feel good, taking it from him?*\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You narrow your eyes, trying to follow the rhythm of Jake’s pull. There has to be something off, but you can't see how he's moving so fast. Smooth, fluid power, his chin snapping over the bar again and again.\n\n \n\n Your grip slips. For a heartbeat your palms skate on the metal, the bar biting hard into your fingers as you catch yourself.\n\n \n\n Behind the window, you hear muffled giggling.\n\n \n\n You haul back into the motion, arms burning. But your rhythm’s gone. Each pull is heavier than the last. Beside you, Jake’s pace never falters. His eyes don’t even glance at you - he’s too busy flashing a quick grin at the window between reps.\n\n \n\n By the time you drop from the bar, Jake is already pacing out a stretch. He claps his hands together, sharp and loud. “Too easy.\"\n\n \n\n You glare back at him. You know he cheated, but you can't see how. All you’re left with is the burn in your arms, the sting in your pride, and the sight of him soaking in the attention like he owns it.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n “No wonder it’s easy for you,” you say between breaths, teeth bared in a smile. “Nothing to lift if you’re all skin and bones.”\n\n \n\n Jake smirks through the next rep. “Yeah? Got muscle where it counts. Not like you, Phillips.” His eyes flick deliberately to your belly before snapping back to the glass, showing off.\n\n \n\n You huff, keeping your grip steady. “Must be hard with keeping them with your genes.”\n\n \n\n That wipes the smirk for a second. He drags himself up again, jaw tight, before answering. “I’ve seen your mum around town. Dainty as an elephant, isn’t she?”\n\n \n\n A low chuckle comes from Jake, but it’s brittle. “Jibes at my mum? You sound like Steve.”\n\n \n\n Grinning back at him, you dig in. “That your brother? Heard he's a star. Bet those girls would rather be watching him than settle for his back-up act.”\n\n \n\n The bar rattles in his hands as his timing stutters. He swings too hard, catches himself, teeth grinding.\n\n \n\n You keep the tempo smooth, and press the blade deeper. “He was the quarterback too, wasn’t he? Set a lot of records. How’s it going, beating them?”\n\n \n\n Jake lets out a sharp breath, almost a growl. His reps turn ragged, form crumbling as his arms burn faster than his temper cools.\n\n \n\n “Still,” you add, voice carrying just enough for the glass to catch it. “At least the scouts know your name. If you’re lucky, you can ride his coat-tails long enough to get a scholarship.\" You take a deep breath as you finish another rep. \"Before they figure out you’re less of an athlete than he is.”\n\n \n\n Jake drops hard from the bar, landing with a thud that shakes the frame. His fists clench, face red and damp. For a second you think he’s going to swing for you, right here, right now.\n\n \n\n “Jake!” Casey’s voice snaps sharp from the far side of the gym. The boy freezes, chest heaving, then swipes his brow with the heel of his hand.\n\n \n\n You drop from the bar, rolling your shoulders. “Just banter between gym buddies,” you say, grinning.\n\n \n\n His eyes cut to yours, flat and venomous. “Time to move on to the next,” he mutters, stalking toward the weights.\n\n \n\n Behind the glass, the girls are still laughing.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n Jake leads you across the floor toward the cable machine, a crooked grin tugging at his mouth as he drags the bench into place directly in front of the long wall mirror. He adjusts the handles, pulling them wide so the cables hum with tension, then slaps the cushion of the bench.\n\n \n\n “Let’s hit upper body. Chest flys. Arms wide. I’ll spot you.”\n\n \n \n You sit, then lower yourself back until your shoulders sink into the vinyl. The fabric of your top stretches tight over your chest as your arms extend to either side to grasp the handles. The metal is cool in your palms, but it’s nothing compared to the awareness prickling at the crown of your head.\n\n \n\n Jake steps in close behind you. Too close. His thighs frame the bench, his shorts hanging low enough that when you glance up, they’re almost brushing your forehead.\n\n \n\n “That’s it,” he murmurs. His voice is quiet, but heavy enough that you feel it settle down your spine. “Now full extension. I want to see how far you can stretch.”\n\n \n\n You draw the cables inward. The weights rise with a steady clank, then drop as you open your arms wide again. Each rep arches your chest, pulling the fabric tighter, lifting you higher.\n\n \n\n “Eyes up,” Jake says. The words are soft but edged with command.\n\n \n\n You obey almost by instinct, staring into the mirror behind you. Your own reflection stares back. Arms spread, chest thrust high, Jake’s looming shape over you, his groin close enough to your mouth that you could lick it. The humiliation is baked into the posture. Each repetition forces you to see yourself the way he does. Open, stretched, displayed.\n\n \n\n By the third rep your focus is already sliding. The cables sing with tension, but the harder pull is the pressure of his presence. His smirk in the mirror. You know you won’t get through the set like this. Not with Jake’s shadow pressing down and the mirror throwing it all back at you.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n Jake leads you across the gym floor to the bench press station, plates clattering as he loads the bar. He slides the big twenties on with a grunt, giving you a sideways glance as if daring you to question it. By the time he’s done, the bar looks monstrous.\n\n \n\n He drops onto the bench, grips the knurling, and heaves the weight up. Each push is loud and deliberate, chest flexing with the strain. His eyes flick toward the window every few reps. Sure enough, the girls outside lean closer, smirks spreading as they watch him perform. He slams the bar back into the rack with a metallic clatter, sitting up to roll his shoulders, sweat bright on his arms.\n\n \n\n “Your turn, old man,” he says, grinning. “Match it if you can.”\n \n \n \nYour eyes drift to the stack as you step closer. Something looks off. Wedged between the big twenties are thin slivers of 2.5s. A trick to bulk up the look without piling on the real weight. He’s still lifting heavy, sure, but it’s not the clean display he’s making it out to be.\n\n \n\n The girls at the glass watch intently now, arms folded, eyes darting between you and Jake. He sits forward on the bench, smirk locked in place, daring you to take his challenge.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n Jake continues with his instructions. “Arms out. Wider. Back arched,” he says, tone steady, rehearsed. “That’s the form.”\n\n \n\n But you know better. He’s not focused on your form. He’s watching the show. And you know better than him on how to do this.\n\n \n\n On the next rep, you tilt your pelvis, flattening your lower back into the bench. The strain shifts, making the pull cleaner. It also means less curve, less spectacle and more stability.\n\n \n\n Jake’s eyes narrow in the mirror. “That's not what I said.” His voice tries for neutral, but there’s a sharpened edge beneath it.\n\n \n\n You don’t look at him. “Proper engagement’s about control, not arching your spine like a bow. Unless you want me to throw it out before the set’s done?”\n\n \n\n For a moment he doesn’t answer. His reflection hovers close, watching, judging. Then he exhales through his nose. “Fine. Whatever.”\n\n \n\n He takes a step back, suddenly disinterested as his smugness falters.\n\n \n\n Reps flow smoother now. You focus on the rhythm, the weight working your shoulders and chest without forcing yourself into a posture designed for someone else’s entertainment. In the mirror, you see the girls have gone quiet. Now watching you with interest.\n\n \n\n By the tenth rep your arms burn, but it’s clean. Solid. Yours.\n\n \n\n Jake crosses his arms, leaning back against the mirror with a curl in his lip. “Guess that works too,” he mutters, reluctant.\n\n \n\n You sit up slowly, catching your breath. For once, you’ve beaten him without brute force. Just by being sharper.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n Jake continues with his instructions. “Arms out. Wider. Back arched,” he says, tone steady, rehearsed. “That’s the form.”\n\n \n\n You are sure this isn't the best way to do this. In fact, you know Jake's not trying to help you. He’s focused watching the show. But you can't work out how to do this any better without emphasising your body.\n\n \n\n “That’s not how you do it,” he says sharply. “Arch. Back high. You’ll never get full extension otherwise.”\n\n \n\n You hesitate. “Feels more stable this way.”\n\n \n\n His smirk deepens. “Stable isn’t strong. Proper form means arch. Big chest. Wide spread. You want results? Do it my way.”\n\n \n\n Finally, you let out a breath and ease back into the curve he wants. Back arched, chest raised, exactly the pose he’d engineered from the start. “That’s it,” he murmurs, satisfied. His hand brushes your side, pressing you deeper into the posture. The cables tremble as you pull, your chest rising each time, your reflection performing exactly as he intended.\n\n \n\n In the mirror you see the girls outside nudge each other, smirks playing at their lips. One tilts her head with a knowing grin. They can see what this looks like, and so can you.\n\n \n\n Jake steps back only once the set is complete. He nods, smug and certain. “Better. But not good enough. Think you'll have to put in some more practice if you want to meet what I'm after.”\n\n \n\n You sit up slowly, a frown tugging at your lips. You did finish, but Jake's not admitting the victory. This display was all for nothing.\n\n \n\n Did you expect for him to play fair?\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You steady your breathing, cables taut in your hands. You already know you’re not going to finish this set. Not with Jake standing so close, his shorts brushing your hairline, his smirk heavy in the mirror. But there’s another way to get through this. An easier way.\n\n \n\n Is that how you’re justifying it?\n\n \n\n Keeping your eyes locked on his, you arch your neck just enough for your nose to brush against the fabric of his shorts. The sweat-darkened cotton carries his scent. Sharp and musky. It should be repulsive, but instead there’s a pull, an animal part of you responding to it.\n\n \n\n You glance up at him, seeing Jake’s eyes widen. But he doesn’t move back. If anything, it seems to root himself in place. You have to crane higher, lips grazing the fabric now. The outline beneath is unmistakable. The heat rising from him, the stiffness against your mouth, makes your pulse kick.\n\n \n\n Your arms sag, the cables hanging limp at your sides. You’re no longer even pretending to row. Through his legs, you see the world upside down. A humiliating picture of a girl on back, legs astride a bench, face pressed against Jake’s crotch. And through the window, the girls are watching. Wide-eyed, half-laughing, half-whispering, drinking in the display.\n\n \n\n Jake tilts his head, voice low and smug. “Maybe we should take this somewhere else.” He makes no move to end the moment himself, but he doesn’t need to. The cables swing idly from your hands, the exercise already long forgotten.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Your voice cuts the air. “Those twenties look thicker than mine. You hiding something, Jake?”\n\n \n\n Outside the window, the girls outside lean in to look at his weights. Jake freezes and for a moment, his grin falters. Then he forces a laugh. “Huh. Must’ve been a mistake.”\n\n \n\n “Sure,” you reply. “I’ll just match, then. Fair's fair.”\n\n \n\n You glance over to the window, seeing the girls murmuring. They’re watching you now.\n\n \n\n You slide into position and take the bar. The weight feels good. Your muscles flex as you push the first rep skyward. Breathe in, brace, press. The burn is there, but it’s steady and manageable.\n\n \n\n Beside you, Jake grunts. Rep after rep, you keep pace. You quickly match his score, then push ahead. By the time you rack the bar with a final slam, you've left his effort in the dust.\n\n \n\n Outside, the girls exchange looks, then grin at you.\n\n \n\n Jake’s jaw works. “Whatever,” he mutters, too low for swagger. The bravado’s fraying.\n\n \n\n The pride hits like a rush of blood, hotter than the strain in your chest. You didn’t just out-lift him. You owned him.\n\n \n\n How does it feel? You didn’t just beat him. You made him kneel.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You grip the bar, palms slick, shoulders tight. The stack feels heavy even before you press, but Jake’s smug grin keeps you rooted.\n\n \n\n The first rep grinds upward, slow and rough. Your clench your teeth. Out of the corner of your eye you catch the girls watching intently.\n\n \n\n Heat floods your chest. You drive the bar up again. One rep. Then another. The rhythm starts to build, though every movement sends fire up your arms. Jake watches. You see his smug grin fade.\n\n \n\n “You’re fading, old man,” he says, but there's nervousness in his voice.\n\n \n\n You block it out, focus on the bar and the next rep. Your lungs burn, your shoulders scream, but you won’t quit. You force the steel upward, lockout rattling as the plates clang against each other.\n\n \n\n The final stretch is nothing but pain. Your vision blurs, sweat dripping hot into your eyes, but you bite down and push. The bar crawls upward, inch by inch, until you slam it back onto the rack with a roar. Your chest heaves, muscles trembling on the edge of collapse.\n\n \n\n Through the glass, the girls shift. They trade quick grins, impressed. The sight makes your pulse hammer harder than the weights ever could.\n\n \n\n Jake notices, too. His jaw tightens. “Alright. You got one. That was an easy weight, though.” The bravado is there, but thinner, his voice edged with frustration.\n\n \n\n You can’t help but let a grin spread across your face, even as your arms shake with exhaustion.\n\n \n\n Yes. This is what it means to be stronger. Pain is nothing when you can put someone beneath you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You grip the bar hard, teeth clenched, every nerve screaming that you’re not about to fold here. The first reps come heavy but steady. Shoulders straining, chest tight. You force each push with a grunt, bar trembling over you.\n\n \n\n By the tenth, your breaths come ragged. Each press shakes, your wrists scream in pain, elbows wobble under the weight. Out of the corner of your eye, you see the girls smirking through the window. They've written you off already.\n\n \n\n You press again. Halfway up, the bar quivers. Your chest burns, your arms dead. Jake's laugh echoes as he watches you.\n\n \n\n “Come on, old man,” he calls loud enough for the girls to hear. “Thought you had grit. Looks like you’re just made to spot me.”\n\n \n\n You dig in, straining, face hot. The bar stalls mid-air. No matter how you push, it won’t move. With a clatter, it drops back to the rack. You sag into the bench, chest heaving. Done.\n\n \n\n “Better luck next time,” Jake says, wiping his forehead with deliberate ease. The smugness drips from every word. \"Although maybe the ballet class is more your thing.\"\n\n \n\n You can’t meet his eyes. Your gaze stays on the ceiling, hot with frustration.\n\n \n\n Pathetic. Maybe he's right. Maybe ballet is more suited to you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n The weights groan as you both press. First few reps are clean and steady. Jake watches you with mild interest, but keeps looking back to window where the girls cluster.\n\n \n\n “Christina ever spot you?” you jab, keeping your voice casual. “Heard she’s stronger than you.”\n\n \n\n Jake snorts. “Just stick to your own set, old man.”\n\n \n\n You grit your teeth, raising the bar again, then let your voice rise, loud enough for the girls against the glass. “Funny, though. Don’t see your dad in here much.” You pause just long enough to draw it out. “Guess he saves the proud-dad act for Steve, huh?”\n\n \n\n Jake's attention is suddenly upon you. \"What did you say?\"\n\n \n\n You feel the grin crawl onto your face. Pressing through another rep, you twist the knife. “Must sting. Everyone says you’ve got your dad's temper, but none of his strength.”\n\n \n\n Jake is right above you now, looking down with fury. You briefly consider stopping, but there's something about this that brings you satisfaction. “Bet the old man wishes Steve was still in Charlton. At least then he’d have a son worth watching.”\n\n \n\n The sound Jake makes is halfway between a growl and a gasp. He lashes out to push the bar down. It lands on your chest, knocking the air out of you. \"You take that back!\" he snaps, pushing the bar down against your body.\n\n \n\n Casey’s voice snaps across the room. “Get that bar off him!\" Out of the corner of your eye, you see him limping over.\n\n \n\n Jake glares down at you for a moment longer, then releases his grip. You immediately push the bar back up and lock it in place, gasping for air.\n\n \n\n \"You alright, son?\" Casey asks you, as you sit up. You nod to him, silently, looking over to Jake who stands off to the side.\n\n \n\n \"I'd say he wins this one by default,\" Casey tells Jake. The quarterback turns to look between the two of you, his cheeks red with fury. “Whatever,” he spits.\n\n \n\n See? Find the crack. Push. Watch him break. That’s how you win.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n You step back from the final set, breath still heavy, sweat slick against your skin. Jake eyes you, his grin sharp. Through the window you see the girls are still there, smirks pressed to the pane, waiting to see who came out on top.\n\n \n\n \n For the first time Jake’s grin falters. He rolls his neck, scowling faintly as the girls’ eyes slide from him to you. Their expressions aren’t subtle. A new appraisal, one that used to be his alone.\n\n \n\n “Alright,” he mutters. “You did okay. For a girl.” He tries for a shrug, but it doesn’t hide the edge in his voice.\n\n \n\n You press him, steady. “And the bet?”\n\n \n\n His jaw tightens. For a heartbeat he looks like he might wriggle out of it. But when he glances back to the window, you see acceptance set in. “Fine. A bet’s a bet.” He jerks his thumb toward the locker room. “C’mon. Let’s settle it.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Jake looks at you with barely concealed lust. “Not sure you won,” he says, voice low. “But I think you deserve a reward, anyway.” His eyes narrow, grin returning.\n\n \n\n The way he says it is pitched just loud enough for the girls outside to catch, drawing a ripple of knowing smiles. He tips his chin toward the locker room. “Want to go somewhere private?”\n\n \n\n Through the window you see the girls watching carefully, smirking.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <> \n \n Jake’s grin only widens, all cocky bravado. Through the window the girls’ attention swings back to him like it never left. He tosses a towel across his shoulder, flexing as though he’s already forgotten you.\n\n \n\n “Like I thought,” he crows, pitching his voice so the girls can hear. “That's what you get for sitting behind a reception desk all day. All talk and no action.”\n\n “Like I thought,” he crows, pitching his voice so the girls can hear. “A girl who couldn't hack it as a cheerleader can't handle a gym set.”\n \n \n “Like I thought,” he crows, pitching his voice so the girls can hear. “You can dress up like a slut, but you don't have the moves to back it up, nerd.”\n \n “Like I thought,” he crows, pitching his voice so the girls can hear. “You're more of a passive nerd than an active girl, aren't you?\"\n\n “Like I thought,” he crows, pitching his voice so the girls can hear. “Rather be playing with activewear barbie than do it yourself, hey nerd?\"\n\n \n “Like I thought,” he crows, pitching his voice so the girls can hear. “You might look like you've got the goods, but you can't back it up.”\n \n “Like I thought,” he crows, pitching his voice so the girls can hear. “Don't think a gym's for you. Maybe you'd feel more at home in a dungeon.\"\n\n “Like I thought,” he crows, pitching his voice so the girls can hear. “Might want to try the ballet class, sweetheart. More suited to your tastes.\"\n\n \n \n \n The girls giggle behind the glass, smirks aimed your way before returning to their favourite spectacle - Jake. He soaks in their laughter and looks like it’s fuel.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n You step back from the final set, breath still heavy, sweat slick down your arms. Jake eyes you from across the room, a towel slung over one shoulder. His chest still rises steady, but there’s no mistaking the tension in the way he looks at you.\n \n\n \n His scowl says it all. He's not happy. Not with you, not with the way the girls on the other side of the window are watching you now instead of him. Their whispers aren’t subtle, one even hides a grin behind her palm.\n\n \n\n Jake spits to the side, jaw tight. “Wasn’t even fresh today. Football practice took it out of me last night. Be a different story if I wasn't training for a game.”\n\n \n\n You towel the sweat from your hands and step closer, voice cutting through. “That’s not how this works. We had a deal. You lost.”\n\n \n\n For a moment he doesn’t answer, the towel bunched in his fist, the muscle in his jaw twitching. Then he snorts, turning toward the locker room. “Whatever. Let’s get it over with.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Jake grins wide, planting his hands on his hips, chest still flushed from the effort. “Just as I thought. Knew you couldn’t keep up.”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t even lower his voice. “Come back when you’re ready to compete. Until then, stick to the light weights. Leave the real work to men who can handle it.”\n\n \n\n The girls outside giggle at the jab. One mimes flexing a bicep and nods toward Jake, the other shakes her head with a laugh at you.\n\n \n\n Jake wipes his palms on the towel and returns to posing in front of the mirror, pretending to go back into another set while the girls’ eyes stay fixed on him.\n\n \n \n Actions\n <> \n \n \n \n You shake your head, firm enough to leave no doubt. Whatever Jake’s suggesting, you don’t want it like that.\n\n \n\n For a second his grin falters. Then the mask slips neatly back into place. He shrugs, all loose shoulders and feigned indifference. “Suit yourself,” he says, tone light. As if it doesn’t matter.\n\n \n\n He slings a towel across his shoulder, turns his back on you and raises an arm to flex. The motion’s casual, but angled perfectly toward the glass. The girls respond immediately, laughter bubbling as they lean forward, eyes sliding over his muscles. They’re already nodding, approving, as if he’s moved on from you without a second thought.\n\n \n\n The sting lands sharper for that. You made the call, but somehow it feels like you’re the one being refused.\n\n \n\n See how easily he twists it? That's how a real man gets his way. Indifference.\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Casey's Gym**\n\n [image: ./images/Gym.png]\n\n \n\n You walk back into the gym. Casey’s finished adjusting the mats and is bouncing lightly on the balls of his feet, rolling his shoulders, shifting his weight, almost dancing. It’s a little uneven, his limp catching now and then, but he moves like someone who remembers at least how it used to feel.\n\n \n\n At the sight of you, he stops. “Alright,” he says, taking one last drag from the cigarette. Then, without ceremony, he stubs it out directly on the skirting board. “You ready?”\n\n \n\n Before you can answer, he tosses a pair of gloves your way. You fumble slightly catching them, but more from the unexpected speed than the weight. Casey chuckles, but in doing so stumbles a little over his bad leg. He grunts, recovers, and says nothing.\n\n \n\n You pull on the gloves slowly, tightening each strap. As you do, your eyes flick toward the window. The boys are still there. Their breath fogs faint patches in the glass. One of them points at Casey and says something you can’t hear, but it makes the others snicker. \n\n \n\n Casey doesn’t look, but his shoulders square just slightly as if he’s trying not to hear what he’s already heard. He steps onto the mat and gestures for you to join him. “Hands up,” he says simply. “Keep your guard tight. Stay light on your feet.”\n\n \n\n He adjusts his stance, loose and low, one glove tapping lightly at his chin.\n\n \n\n “If you’re ready, we’ll begin.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You step onto the mat, gloves raised. Casey starts circling you, light on his feet despite his leg. His eyes flick across your stance, watching every shift in your balance. Then, without warning, he throws a couple of slow, easy punches toward your gloves.\n\n \n\n They land with a soft thud. The technique is still sharp, but there’s no weight behind them. Not anymore.\n\n \n\n “Turn that lead foot in,” he mutters. “You’re open on the left. Chin down. Guard tight.”\n\n \n\n You adjust, and he nods. He keeps circling, throwing a few more lazy jabs. You sense he’s not trying to hit, but testing your footing. Each time, he calls something out. “Don’t step back. Pivot. Jab now. Again.”\n\n \n\n Nodding, you follow his rhythm. One-two. Then another jab. Your fist connects with his glove. Then his shoulder. Then, surprisingly, his chest.\n\n \n\n You weren’t trying to land a clean shot, but it hits harder than expected. Casey stumbles a half-step back, readjusting his stance with a grunt.\n\n \n\n Glancing towards the window, you see the boys are still there watching with glee. One of them mimics your punch and the others burst into laughter. Looking back, you see Casey’s eyes on them before catching sight of yours.\n\n \n\n He nods again, more slowly this time. “Not bad,” he mutters, rebalancing himself on his bad leg. “But you’ll need more than that to beat me.”\n\n \n\n The words are said to be challenging, but his stance says otherwise. You’re sure it wouldn’t take much at all to put him down.\n\n \n\n The gym door creaks open behind you. Glancing back, you see the boys now standing in the doorway, grinning wide. One of them steps forward. “Don’t be a sissy!” he shouts. “Finish him off!”\n\n \n\n They laugh again, and suddenly the room feels smaller. Heavier. You glance back at Casey. His hands are up. Barely. His face is blank. Waiting.\n\n \n\n Go on, show those boys what sort of man you are.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You adjust your footing. Casey’s still moving, but slower now. You begin to press forward with purpose. Every time he shifts to favour his bad leg, you shift with him. Cut off his angle. Force the weight onto it.\n\n \n\n He throws another jab, but you don’t back off this time. You dip inside and deliver a clean shot to his jaw. Casey staggers. The boys snigger again.\n\n \n\n Casey grins, trying to play it off. “Careful now,” he mutters. “This is meant to be your lesson.”\n\n \n\n But you don’t answer. You glance at the doorway. They're not laughing at you anymore. They're watching with sharp eyes. Devilish smiles spurring you to continue. You look back at Casey. Something tightens in your chest. You want them to see. Be impressed by you.\n\n \n\n That’s it. Show him who’s the man here.\n\n \n\n You swing again. This time, Casey nearly folds. He catches himself on one knee, breath caught in his throat. You quickly follow-up, not waiting for him to recover. Your fist lands square against his temple. And Casey crumples.\n\n \n\n He hits the mat, hard. His gloves fall to the side and his arm lifts slightly, signalling to yield.\n\n \n\n You take deep breaths, as if inhaling the testosterone in the air. A satisfied grin spreads across your face, as you tower over the old man. Laughter erupts from the doorway. “Oof, he's done!” you hear one say. “Thought you said he was a boxer?” “Bet a girl could’ve done better!”\n\n \n\n Casey growls and throws his glove in their direction. “Scram!” he shouts, voice cracked. “Get outta here before I knock your blocks off!”\n\n \n\n The boys back off, still laughing, but they leave. The gym door swings shut behind them. Casey stays on the mat for a moment longer. Then, slowly, he stands. “You’ve got good instincts,” he says, brushing himself off. “Well done.”\n\n \n\n But his voice doesn’t match his words. He avoids your eye, instead glancing toward the window. There’s a tight, embarrassed silence hanging between you.\n\n \n\n You stand tall. Your body is thrumming with energy. Testosterone buzzes in your chest. You showed them. Showed him. This is what kind of man you are now. Charlton saw it.\n\n \n\n Even if Casey just took yet another beating, mentally and physically.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n You could win this. You know it. He’s off-balance. Slower. And you’ve already landed the cleaner shots. A few more and he’d be on the mat. But you glance at the window. At the boys. At their wide grins and waiting sneers. You don’t want to put him through that.\n\n \n\n Taking a breath, you start to pull back. Let your guard dip just slightly. Miss the timing on a jab. You create space where none needs to be. Quickly, Casey steps into it. He lands a clean one to your ribs. Then another to your arm. The third hits harder. You grunt.\n\n \n\n Casey chuckles, breath catching a little. “Looks like you’ve still got a few things to learn,” he mutters, wiping sweat from his brow.\n\n \n\n You glance back to the window. The boys have gone quiet. Watching more closely now. A smirk flickers across one of their faces as Casey lands another punch. \n\n \n\n *Are you really going to let yourself be shown up in front of them by a has-been?*\n\n \n\n Casey’s next punch answers that question. It lands square across your jaw. Your hearing reduces to a low buzzing, as if underwater. You stagger, hands rising too slow.\n\n \n\n Another jab. Then a hook. Casey’s on you now, the confidence returning to his movements, even if the speed never does. He’s working the angles, shifting his weight, in spite of his limp showing every time.\n\n \n\n One more punch lands and your knees give way. The mat hits you hard.\n\n \n\n From somewhere behind the ringing in your ears, the laughter starts. “Couldn’t even beat the old man!” “What a sissy!”\n\n \n\n You lie there for a moment. Not from pain, but from the shame. To his credit, Casey rounds on them. “Scram, the lot of ya!” he shouts, voice raw. “This ain’t your lesson!”\n\n \n\n The boys retreat, laughing all the way, but they leave. The gym door swings shut. You feel a glove nudge your shoulder. Casey offers a hand. “Don’t worry about them,” he says, pulling you up. “You did alright. Tried your best. Some men… just ain’t built for fighting.”\n\n \n\n He pats your back, but it’s awkward. He’s panting hard now, leg shaking slightly under the effort. With a smile, he limps toward the counter and lights another cigarette. You glance toward the window again. The boys are still out there. Gesturing. Laughing.\n\n \n\n Is this what Charlton expects of you? To prove yourself by knocking down an old man?\n\n \n\n And if so, you wonder - are you really cut out to be a man in this town?\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Casey's Gym**\n\n [image: ./images/Gym.png]\n\n \n\n You step back into the gym and immediately recognise a few familiar faces gathered near the mirrored wall.\n \n \nFlorence leans against the barre, her flame red hair pulled into a high ponytail. One foot rests along the barre as she stretches, her gaze sharp.\n \n \n \nAnnie sits on a bench, tying her ballet slippers with a practiced rhythm. She flicks her blonde hair back through a headband, suddenly glaring when she catches the sight of you.\n\n \nAnnie sits on a bench, tying her ballet slippers with a practiced rhythm. She flicks her blonde hair back through a headband without looking up.\n\n \n \n \n\n Britney and Stacey stand side by side in front of the mirror. Britney tugs at her leotard with a grimace. “I look frumpy,” she complains, pouting.\n\n \n\n You hesitate for a moment as their eyes shift toward you. Then DeBussy steps briskly into your path, clipboard tucked under one arm.\n\n \n\n “Ah, . Just in time!” she beams. “Ladies, please line up against the mirror and we’ll begin.”\n\n \n\n You take your place among them, the mirror stretching out in front of you. Somewhere in the background, Casey lingers behind the gym counter, disinterested, barely glancing your way. But through the wide gym windows, you see the real audience. A cluster of teenage boys gathered outside, grinning, pointing and waiting.\n\n \n\n “Eyes sharp, ladies,” DeBussy calls, smiling as she walks the line. “Now. Let’s get started, shall we?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You stand in line with the other girls, your reflection stretching beside theirs in the mirror. DeBussy walks the row slowly, clipboard tucked beneath one arm, a long wooden baton now in her hand.\n\n \n\n “Ladies,” she begins, voice crisp. “Ballet is discipline. Ballet is posture. Ballet is presence.” She taps the end of the baton lightly against the floor. “When done properly, you needn’t say a word. You command a room by the way you hold your body.”\n\n \n\n She turns toward a small sound system set up by the mirror and taps a button. Classical piano begins to play. Then she turns back to you all. “First position. Let’s begin.”\n\n \n\n You fumble to copy the pose that the rest of the girls drop into naturally. Heels together, toes out, back straight. The slippers on your feet slip too easily on the polished gym floor.\n\n \n\n “Good,” DeBussy says, ignoring your slip. “Now relevé.”\n\n \n\n You rise. Not gracefully, but more than Stacey who staggers into Britney. “Hey! Watch it, Bambi!”\n\n \n\n “You’re taking up too much space,” Stacey snaps back.\n\n \n\n From across the room, DeBussy’s voice cuts cleanly. “Miss Kaplar, Miss Hudson. Less commentary. More commitment.”\n\n \n\n Both girls straighten, synchronised and sulking. Stacey glares at Britney in the mirror. Britney sticks out her tongue as a reply. \n \n \nA few spots down the mirror, Annie moves with surprising ease. Her arms raise and lower with elegance, back arched, chin high. She glances over her shoulder towards the window, flashing a smile at the boys watching.\n\n \nFlorence, by contrast, is absorbed in the steps. Her eyes never lift from her feet, and she barely reacts to the mirror at all. But there’s a faint, peaceful smile on her lips. “Very good, Miss Drew,” DeBussy comments as she passes.\n \n \n\n DeBussy claps once. “Demi plié,” she says. “And stretch. Reach down, ladies. Forward from the hips.”\n\n \n\n You follow the motion awkwardly, fingers extending toward the floor. The stretch tightens across your calves. Your back arches. Your bum lifts. And as you dip low, you catch sight through your own legs of the boys gathered at the window.\n\n \n\n They’re still there. Still watching. Grinning now. You feel your cheeks flush, suddenly aware of every inch of yourself. Of what you must look like and what they must be seeing.\n\n \n\n DeBussy glides past behind you, gently adjusting your arm. “This is how you hold attention,” she says softly. “With elegance. With awareness. With pride.”\n\n \n\n You try to hold the pose. Your muscles strain. The slippers slip again. Your balance wobbles. But DeBussy’s baton taps once against your bum. “Again,” she calls. Then her voice lowers to a whisper. “And remember. Assert yourself. You deserve to be looked at.”\n\n \n\n You take another breath and prepare to bend again, but your eyes catch those of one of the boys looking in through the window. He grins, directly at you. Almost daring you to resume posing. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You take another breath and bend again, but this time, you choose how. As your fingers reach toward the floor, you fold slowly from the hips, pushing your weight back through your heels. Your rear lifts as you rise onto your toes, arching deeper into the stretch. Then you dare a glance to the window.\n\n \n\n The boys are staring. Not at your face, but eyes firmly on your bum held high into the air. Then their glance drifts to your face. Instinctively, you flash them a grin.\n\n \n\n Some part of you wishes to fight the urge, but as you rise up there’s a flutter inside your body that is difficult to ignore. You maintain eye contact with the boys through the window, noting their looks follow your every gesture and flourish. Rightly or wrongly, you are in control.\n\n \n\n DeBussy’s voice comes from next to you, whispering. “Very good. Perfect form.”\n\n \n\n You look to her, noting her warmth as she taps the barre with her baton. “Now, leg up. Let’s see a good extension through the hips. Toes pointed. Groin forward.”\n\n \n\n You obey, lifting your leg in a slow arc until your ankle rests on the barre. The stretch runs like a line of tension down your inner thigh. Your arms float outward, one hand lightly gripping the rail. The leotard pulls at the seam between your legs, tugging taut across your groin. You glance up as you lean over, meeting the boys' gaze. Their eyes don’t drift now. Instead they stay exactly where the stretch reveals the most. Your crotch.\n\n \n\n “Capture their glances,” DeBussy murmurs next to you. “Hold their attention.”\n\n \n\n Your breath catches. The boys don’t look away. A surge spreads through your body. You feel powerful.\n\n \n\n *Is this what you think of power now? To hold stares of boys with your body?*\n\n \n\n DeBussy turns back to the class, nodding in approval. “Final position, please. Arms back. Chest high. Show pride in your poise.”\n\n \n\n You lower your leg and reposition, stepping back from the barre. Your feet draw together, heels touching. Slowly, you reach behind your back, arms stretched wide as if embracing the room. Your shoulders roll, and your chest pushes forward. Your eyes flick to the window. The boys are captivated by your chest. Grins gone. Now staring.\n\n \n\n You smile as you hold their attention. What must they be thinking, you wonder. What they would say if you could speak to them. Maybe they’ll hang back after the lesson. Chat to you outside. What would they ask of you?\n\n \n\n *It sounds like you want them to.*\n\n \n\n You continue to hold the pose and their gaze, feeling in control. Beneath the sensation, however, is something more. A titter of endorphins. At being admired. And watched. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You glare back at the boy outside. You’re not here to put on a show. Not for DeBussy. Not for a gym class. And certainly not for the boys outside.\n\n \n\n The classical music continues its steady rhythm. Around you, the girls move in time, limbs stretching in elegant arcs. But your body stays still. \n\n \n\n “Demi plié,” DeBussy says from behind, her tone as sweet as ever. “And stretch. Let your presence speak through your posture.”\n\n \n\n You lower into the position just enough to count. Your knees bend, but you minimise the effort. You don’t rise onto your toes. No lift in your arms. You keep your movements tight, efficient, stripped of flourish. You glance out the window, noting the smiles on the boys' faces now wiped.\n\n \n\n “Leg up,” DeBussy adds, tapping the barre. “Extension through the hips. A dancer commands the gaze.”\n\n \n\n “Posture is power,” DeBussy says, near your ear. “Don’t lose their gaze. Be in control.”\n\n \n\n But you don’t. You raise your leg just enough to rest your ankle on the bar, keeping your torso upright. Your back stays stiff. You lean forward only slightly, stretching your hamstring. Chin down, fingers barely touching your leg. In the mirror, you see the boys begin to shift. Their attention pulls away to the other girls who are playing more of a part.\n\n \n\n DeBussy doesn’t comment, but now walks past you without comment. “Good extension, Miss Hudson. And nice turnout, Miss Kaplar.” Nothing for you. Not even a glance.\n\n \n\n You draw out of the pose. Your breath is steady, but your heart beats fast in the unspoken confrontation. If this is what Charlton calls power, then maybe power isn’t what you want.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n The music fades, and DeBussy claps twice. “Very good, ladies. That will do for today.”\n\n \n\n Around you, everyone seems to exhale at once. Faces are flushed. Breathing shallow. Tights and leotards cling with effort.\n\n \n\n \n DeBussy meets your eyes immediately. “Excellent work today,” she says, stepping toward you. She tilts her head faintly toward the window. “They certainly noticed.” The boys are still there, grinning, one of them catching your eye and mouthing the words call me with a wink.\n\n \n\n “You’re learning,” DeBussy adds. “To control a room, you must know its secrets. And people carry their secrets on their eyes. Especially boys. Let them believe you’re showing them everything. And you’ll see what they’re really thinking.”\n\n \n\n Florence smiles as she leans against the barre, taking deep breaths. She doesn’t speak, but her quiet nod tells you she noticed, and maybe understood more than she’s letting on.\n\n \n \n Annie stares at you, slick with sweat. “Showing off, Jen?” she mutters. “Or just living your cheerleading glory days?”\n\n \n Annie bounces over, slick with sweat but smiling. “You were amazing,” she says. “Did you see their faces? They were watching you over me. That never happens.” She nudges you with a grin. “You turned a few heads.”\n\n \n \n Britney and Stacey look your way, but say nothing. You catch the end of a hushed exchange. \"I could've done that,\" Britney huffs.\n\n \n\n “Sure, once you lay off those ice cream shakes at Fresh Pot,” Stacey mutters back. Britney pouts, but turns to the mirror and tugs at the waistline of her leotard.\n\n \n\n You glance to the window one more time. The boys are still watching. You feel their eyes on your skin. Your chest rises with a breath you didn’t mean to hold. It feels nice. To be seen like this. To have earned that attention. Or maybe claimed it.\n\n \n\n DeBussy’s baton taps the floor. “Next weekend, same time,” she calls. “Do keep practicing. We are not finished.”\n\n \n DeBussy doesn’t approach you. Her praise is already elsewhere. “Lovely elevation, Miss Hudson,” she says, moving toward Britney and Stacey. “And you, Miss Kaplar. Well, I’m not sure you need to learn anything.” Stacey smirks. Britney sulks. “I was elegant,” she mutters, tugging at her tights.\n\n \n\n “Not with that bounce,” Stacey mutters. “Or your lunch orders.”\n \n \n\n Florence wipes her brow with the sleeve of her arm. “It’s harder than it looks,” she says softly. “But I guess it comes easier if you go all in.”\n\n \n \n Annie catches your eye from across the gym, grinning with satisfaction. Her attention then returns back to the window, offering her audience a coy smile. \n\n \n Annie catches your eye from across the gym, smiling politely. But her attention quickly drifts back to the window, where the boys linger. Her expression shifts to a coy smile. She knows they’re still watching her.\n\n \n \n DeBussy’s baton taps the floor. “Next weekend, same time,” she says. “Do keep practicing. We are not finished.”\n\n \n \n\n \n You watch as the others turn to leave for the locker room. You glance around the gym, trying to make sense of it. The promise of assertion... through exhibitionism? You question whether DeBussy will see you back here next weekend. Is this really for you?\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You watch as the others turn to leave for the locker room. You glance around the gym, trying to make sense of it. The promise of assertion... through exhibitionism? You question whether DeBussy will see you back here next weekend.

    "text": "Changing quickly, each layer brings a strange blend of embarrassment and curiosity. The top rides high, the shorts lower still. When you glance in the mirror, what stares back is unmistakably Annie. Flushed cheeks, long legs, bare midriff, the soft contour of a chest framed for visibility.\n\n \n\n You should feel exposed. But somehow, you don’t. Instead, you smile in the mirror. There’s a strange thrill that catches in your chest. You’re not sure if this is how Annie feels when she walks into a room. But in her skin and in her clothes, it’s hard not to feel like you’re meant to be looked at.\n\n \n\n *Or like some part of you wants to be?*\n\n \n\n You breathe in. Gordon will be waiting. Watching. Compared to other men in Charlton, he seemed disinterested in obviously looking at you. But this is Charlton. You’ve learned the hard way that things are never as easy as they seem.\n\n \n\n Or do you wish he was more interested in you?\n\n \n\n You step toward the exit.\n\n \n You need to do this, you think, and begin changing your clothes. Putting them on isn’t tricky. You pull the bra over your head and over your breasts. The leggings are surprisingly stretchy and comfortable to wear. You pull and tug them up, ensuring they are free of wrinkles. \n\n \n\n A full-length mirror hangs nearby on the wall. You look at yourself in it, turning to face away and looking at yourself over your shoulder.\n\n \n\n The activewear might be comfy to wear, but it looks tight and restrictive, riding up between your buttocks and clinging to your body like paint. The face of Jennifer smiles back at you in the mirror, looking cheeky. You remember that Jennifer looks like this for all her sessions with Gordon. You’re not sure how that makes you feel.\n\n \n You need to do this, you think, and begin changing your clothes. Each piece fits too snugly. Whether it clings, clasps, or rides high, the end result is the same. When you look in the mirror, there’s no mistaking what you look like.\n\n \n\n You might look like Emily, but it’s an Emily ready to be watched. And in front of Gordon.\n\n \n\n Gordon has never expressed any ill will or malice towards Emily. But this is Charlton. You’ve learned the hard way that things are never as easy as they seem.\n\n \n\n Or do you wish he was more interested in you?\n\n \n\n You step toward the exit.\n\n \n You need to do this, you think, and begin changing your clothes. Each piece fits too snugly. Whether it clings, clasps, or rides high, the end result is the same. When you look in the mirror, there’s no mistaking what you look like.\n\n \n\n An image comes into your mind. The picture of you, working out, as guys watch and gawp at your bum and your exposed midriff.\n\n \n\n Now that could become a reality. With Gordon as the observer. He’s never expressed any ill will or malice towards you. But this is Charlton. You’ve learned the hard way that things are never as easy as they seem.\n\n \n\n Or do you wish he was more interested in you?\n\n \n\n You step toward the exit.\n \n \n \n You close the locker, deciding against the workout. You head towards the door, still dressed in the same clothes.\n \n\n**Actions**\n\n<>",

    "text": "You peel away your clothes with mechanical movements, folding them neatly onto the bench beside the locker. For a moment, you hesitate, just looking at the uniform laid out before you. It’s absurd. Sexy. Impractical. \n\n \n\n You slide into the dress.\n\n \n\n It hugs close where it shouldn’t. The fabric is light, clinging to your form with an unsettling accuracy, and the lace feels more decorative than functional. You tug at the hem, but it barely grazes mid-thigh.\n\n \n\n The stockings whisper as you pull them up your legs. The heels are a battle of their own. Unsteady, sculpted things that force your hips into a sway you didn’t ask for.\n\n \n\n By the time you leave the locker room, the echo of your footsteps down the hallway seems… louder. More noticed. Staff glance as you pass. Guests turn. A man gives a second glance, smiling to himself. You feel exposed. Like decoration.\n\n \n\n You reach the kitchen doors and push through.\n\n \n You slip out of your clothes with practiced ease, folding them with care. The uniform waits for you like a second skin. You no longer hesitate.\n\n \n\n The dress slides on smoothly now, its cut familiar, its cling expected. It cinches at the waist and lifts in all the right places. You adjust the hem, but not to tug it lower. Just to smooth it flat.\n\n \n\n Stockings stretch up your thighs with a whisper, and the once challenging heels now feel natural. Even flattering. You move differently in them. You know it.\n\n \n\n You step out into the hallway. You’re not sure if you’ve stopped noticing the stares… or if you’ve just started accepting them.\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n You don’t even think about it. The second your hands are in the water, something just… clicks. A rhythm. A pull. You scrub the dishes with careful attention, polishing each plate until it gleams. Cutlery gets stacked in perfect alignment. Pans lose their grease like a challenge you’re eager to meet.\n\n \n\n You’re not doing this because you want to. Not exactly. You’re doing it because it feels right.\n\n \n\n Natural.\n\n \n\n The scent of lemon soap, the clink of clean plates. There’s comfort in it. Focus. Order. You lose track of time, only surfacing when you realise you’re halfway through the stack without noticing the minutes pass.\n\n \n\n Pierre circles you a few times, arms folded. He watches without comment. Until finally, he grunts. “Hmph. Surprised,” he mutters. “Didn’t think lazy English girls knew how to work.”\n\n \n\n You don’t say anything. But part of you is… pleased. Not at him. At the result. At the shine.\n\n \n\n By the end of your shift, your arms ache and the front of your uniform is damp with soapy water. But the sinks are empty, and everything is exactly where it should be. Pierre even reaches into the tip jar near the door and stuffs a wad of notes in your hands.\n\n \n\n You exhale. Satisfied.\n\n \n\n Even if you know you shouldn’t be.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You roll up your sleeves and try to focus. The water is hot. The pile of dishes, endless. You do your best to scrub with purpose, but the pressure of doing it right weighs heavy.\n\n \n\n And Pierre wastes no time making it worse.\n\n \n\n “Non, non, non!” he snaps, swooping in like a hawk. “You clean like a girl who has never worked a day in her life. Look! Look at this pan! What is this? English laziness? Oui?”\n\n \n\n You grit your teeth.\n\n \n\n He steps in behind you, muttering in French. His hands reach around, grabbing yours, forcing them into the soapy water.\n\n \n\n “This is how you scrub. With force. With purpose. Not like some dainty little mouse too afraid to chip her precious nails.”\n\n \n\n He presses in closer, his body heavy and invasive. His breath hot and sour near your ear. “You girls are always the same. No discipline. No pride.”\n\n \n\n Your stomach tightens. The closeness. The stink of cigarette smoke and sweat. The roughness of his grip. And his crotch, pushing against you, undeniably there, pressing into the back of your uniform.\n\n \n\n You try to keep breathing steady. Try to stay focused on the task. He says he’s teaching.\n\n \n\n But it feels like something else.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n [Dutiful Doer] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n You don't pull away. You don't even think about pulling away. There’s a voice in the back of your mind murmuring that this isn’t right. That you shouldn’t let him touch you like this. That this isn't what you signed up for. But it's drowned out by something deeper. A heavy, compelling instinct.\n\n \n\n He's your superior.\n\n \n\n That thought alone sits like an anchor in your chest. Of course you should listen. Of course you should follow his instructions. That’s what you’re here to do. To work. To be helpful. To please.\n\n \n\n Pierre keeps moving behind you. Rough. Impatient. His fingers dig into yours as he corrects your grip on a plate, his body pressing close enough that you can feel the outline of his belt buckle through your skirt. “You see? That’s how you scrub,” he mutters, breath hot and thick with smoke. “Not so complicated. Even an English girl can get it right with enough repetition.”\n\n \n\n You nod. Obedient. Automatic.\n\n \n\n Throughout the shift, he returns again and again - adjusting your posture, repositioning your hands, chastising your speed. And each time, he gets closer. The hem of your uniform is damp, clinging to your thighs from the splashing. Soapy water trails down your arms. Suds stain your apron. And still, you just… let it happen.\n\n \n\n You can’t tell him to stop. Something in you just won’t allow it.\n\n \n\n By the end of your shift, your arms ache. Your fingers are pruned and raw. But more than that, you’re flustered. Your cheeks are warm, your breath shallow.\n\n \n\n And you don't know if it’s the exertion... the heat of the kitchen... or the constant press of Pierre’s body. Probably all of it.\n\n \n\n He grunts, tossing his towel onto a counter. “Not bad,” he says. “Not good, either. But you tried.”\n\n \n \n He nods toward the battered tin on the far side of the counter. “Take something from the tip jar. One coin. You’ve earned it.”\n\n \n\n You nod again. Still silent. Still obedient.\n\n \n\n Your hands tremble as you dry them.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You feel Pierre behind you. Too close, too heavy, too certain. And for one sickening second, you're frozen. But then... something clicks.\n\n \n\n So, slowly, you shift. The smallest roll of your hips. Nothing exaggerated. Nothing overt. Just… receptive.\n\n \n\n Pierre stills. You don’t turn. Don’t acknowledge him. Just keep scrubbing. Let your hips sway slightly with the rhythm of the plates. The water sloshes. The spray catches the hem of your skirt.\n\n \n\n Behind you, he exhales. Low and long. “Ah… enfin,” he murmurs. “Now you understand,” he says, barely audible. “Work with the rhythm. Let the motion flow through you.”\n\n \n\n You don’t reply. You can’t. But you grind back against him, rolling your bum around against his groin, feeling his junk stiffen against your rear.\n\n \n\n His hands creep out of the sink, and rise up to your hips. The dirty dishwater soaking into your uniform. Then, further. Up around your waist. Underneath your arms. And as you continue to scrub, his hands cup your breasts.\n\n \n\n “This is what you want, mademoiselle?” he purrs, mouth close to your ear. “You like feeling dirty?”\n\n \n\n You search for any other staff in the corners of your eyes, but it's just you and Pierre. His fingers, wet with dirty dishwater, pull at your top. You know this is your last chance to try to stop him.\n\n \n\n If you want to...\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n\n You say nothing. He takes it as a sign to continue. His fingers roughly pull at your breasts, water soaking into your top. Then, with a flick that seems practiced, you feel his cold hands enter your top, playing with your nipples.\n\n \n\n You pant as you try to focus on the dishes, feeling your legs almost buckle from the sensations. Your uniform clings to your body, soaked through with greasy water and grime. And his fingers squeeze at your glands, as if he’s trying to push you as far as you’ll go.\n\n \n\n The grinding is instinctive now, almost guided by his thrusting. You smell the cigarette on his breath near your ear, even the touch of his stubble against your neck.\n\n \n\n “Dirty English girls,” he mutters. “They have their uses.”\n\n \n\n The evening stretches on, a slow, humiliating procession of tasks. Every pot scrubbed, every pan rinsed, is accompanied by his voice near your ear. And whenever he returns from cooking to instruct you, his hands explore you. Too often your top is pulled down, seeping with greasy liquid. You find yourself quickly rinsing suds off dirty plates with your breasts hanging free, nipples erect, as the chef flicks them with his fingers as he walks by.\n\n \n\n \"Oh la la,\" you hear Pierre mutter. \"Like rockets, ready to launch! I think you enjoy being on the washing station, mademoiselle.\"\n\n \n\n By the end of your shift, you are soaking. Both in dirty water… and in other ways. When the final plate is stacked and your arms are trembling from the effort, you finally turn. Aware that you stand before him, dressed in a sopping wet French Maid's uniform, with your top pulled down and your pert breasts exposed for his eyes to take in.\n\n \n\n Pierre stands a few steps back, arms crossed, watching you with a smirk that’s equal parts approval and ownership. “Hmph,” he grunts. “Better. Much better.”\n\n \n \n He steps over to the tip jar, rifles through it, and without a word drops three notes into your palm. You blink, surprised.\n\n \n\n He shrugs. “Good service should be rewarded. And you? You served… with enthusiasm.”\n\n \n\n Then, more softly: “You’ll do well here, ma chérie. As long as you keep… dancing.”\n\n \n\n You nod, throat tight.\n\n \n\n And as you leave the kitchen, you pull your damp uniform back into place. Thighs aching, nipples raw, heart twisted into something strange, you realise that you got through it. You earned your tips.\n\n \n\n But you’re not sure what you just submitted to. Or who you were while doing it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You twist suddenly, knocking his hands away with a wet slap of skin on skin. “Don’t,” you snap, your voice low, shaking more than you’d like. “I said don’t.”\n\n \n\n Pierre freezes behind you, hands still half-raised. The room feels sharper somehow. The hiss of a pan, the clang of metal, the hum of the fluorescent lights above. His breath hitches, then steadies. He straightens, sniffing once like nothing happened. “Tch. English girls. Always think they’re too good for a little… guidance.”\n\n \n\n You glare at him. Say nothing. He adjusts his sleeves. Wipes his hands on a towel. “Fine. Wash. Don’t learn. Makes no difference to me.” But he doesn’t come close again.\n\n \n\n You straighten your top to ensure you aren't exposed, but feel the presence of dirty dishwater embedded into your clothing. The dishwater that was on Pierre's hands. That roughly pawed at you.\n\n \n\n The rest of the shift passes in silence, but you keep your eyes forward and your shoulders square. At the end, Pierre dismisses you with a grunt, offering no tips, but no further harassment.\n\n \n\n You just wonder what it will be like next time.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You feel Pierre behind you. The heat of his body, the sour breath against your neck. It’s awful. Degrading. But a thought sparks in the back of your mind: maybe… maybe if you take control of it, twist it into something on your terms, you can at least feel like you’re not just enduring it.\n\n \n\n So... you shift your weight. You grind your hips back. Not too much. Just a little. Just enough to send a message. Or that was the idea.\n\n \n\n Instead, your heel slips slightly on a slick patch of tile. Your hips jerk backwards with too much force and not enough grace - slamming into Pierre’s thigh like an awkward mule kick.\n\n \n\n There’s a pause.\n\n \n\n A long one.\n\n \n\n Pierre coughs. Loudly. Steps back. And stares. “…Mon dieu,” he mutters at last. “You try to dance while scrubbing dishes? Is this a new English girl seduction technique?”\n\n \n\n You whip around, face flaming. “N-no, I just --”\n\n \n\n He waves you off, half amused, half baffled. “Non, non. I do not want to know. You are… how do you say… spirited.”\n\n \n\n The rest of the shift unfolds slowly. He doesn’t press against you again, but he doesn’t let it go either. Every time you bend to reach a pot, every time you rinse a plate too vigorously, he comments. “Careful, mademoiselle! Don’t twirl too hard, you might break a hip.”\n\n \n\n “Such elegance! Like a goose trying ballet.”\n\n \n\n The hours drag. The water stays hot. The dishes never end. You work through them all. Head down, cheeks burning, arms aching.\n\n \n\n By the time you finally finish and call out that the sink is clear, your back is sore and your pride is curled in a damp ball next to your soaked hemline. Pierre walks over, inspecting the sparkling basin like it’s a suspect in a crime scene.\n\n \n\n “Still dirty,” he mutters, with a smirk that says otherwise. Then, grudgingly, he nods. “But you scrubbed well enough. Even with your… little performance.”\n\n \n\n He saunters over to the battered tin on the counter, plucks two coins from the jar, and drops them into your palm with exaggerated care. “One for cleaning,” he says. Then he pauses.\n\n \n\n “And one for entertainment.”\n\n \n\n He winks.\n\n \n\n You’re not sure which part of the night you’ll regret more. But at least you got paid.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You bite the inside of your cheek. You don’t want to let him do this, but… what else are you supposed to do?\n\n \n\n He’s your superior. You’re new. And this isn’t the sort of place where objections go down well. So when his hands close over yours again, you don’t stop him. When his hips press against you - just a little too firm, just a little too familiar - you don’t move away.\n\n \n\n It’s easier, you tell yourself. It’s expected. And just maybe, it’s the only way to get through the shift without more shouting. He keeps correcting you. His grip is rough, and his voice is low and disapproving. “Faster, girl. Hotter water. Elbows up. You want to leave grease behind?”\n\n \n\n You feel your uniform dampen with each pass. Splashes from the sink soaking through your apron, trailing down your thighs. Your body aches, but you keep moving. By the end of it, your cheeks are warm. Your breathing short. You hate how it’s affected you. The tension. The heat. The strange, gnawing sense of guilt for not saying no… mixed with a sick sort of relief for just getting through it.\n\n \n\n Pierre snorts, tossing a dish towel aside. “Tolerable,” he mutters. “Could be worse.”\n\n \n\n He gestures at the tip jar on the counter. “Take one. No more.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n The moment his hands wrap around yours, you stiffen. And when he presses closer - his breath at your ear, his voice smug and belittling - you snap. “No,” you mutter. Then louder. “Get off.”\n\n \n\n You yank your hands free, twisting away from him. Soap splashes across the floor.\n\n \n\n Pierre steps back, looking genuinely surprised. “Oh, I see,” he says, lifting his hands like you’re the one being dramatic. “You want to fail by yourself. Fine. Women!”\n\n \n\n You square your shoulders and say nothing. But your heartbeat is hammering in your ears.\n\n \n\n He doesn’t touch you again. Doesn’t come close. But his silence is heavy. Judging.\n\n \n\n You return to your station, ignoring the flush in your cheeks. Better this way. Better to set the line.\n\n \n\n Even if it makes the rest of the shift unbearable.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You enter the lobby and glance at the duty board near the podium, where Lennox’s scratchy handwriting has been scrawled beneath the staff roster. One note stands out:\n\n \n\n “Lunchtime: Bar support (Andrea). Staff rotation short again. Smile and serve.” \n \n\n You sigh. You’re supposed to be a maid, not bar staff. But the Charlton Hotel seems to run permanently understaffed. And you’re learning quickly that saying no isn’t really part of the culture here.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n The lobby rota still reads the same:\n\n \n\n \"Lunchtime: Bar support (Andrea). Smile and serve.\"\n \n\n No one’s fixed the staffing issue. And no one’s likely to. By now, you’ve accepted that being a maid at the Charlton Hotel comes with an elastic job description. One that includes bar duty whenever the schedule demands it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n You check the schedule on the lobby board. Another line in Lennox’s jagged handwriting:\n\n \n\n \"Afternoon – Lobby carpet detail (Andrea). Bucket + cloth. Back straight. Smile.\" \n \n\n You sigh. Loudly. But there’s no one to hear it or care. A proper hotel might have a machine for this kind of work. But the Charlton Hotel is anything but modern. \n\n \n\n You find the battered bucket tucked behind the reception desk, fill it with water and soap, and grab a fraying cloth. Your knees hit the ground, and the work begins.\n\n \n\n The carpet is an endless expanse of intricate patterns and ancient stains. No matter how hard you scrub, the marks remain. Like memories burned into fabric. You try to focus on the rhythm of the cloth, the swish of water, but your uniform clings tighter with each motion. Riding up the more you lean in.\n\n \n\n You catch a few glances from passing guests. Some watch too long. Others pretend not to, but their eyes linger. Bent forward, on all fours, your skirt creeping higher… it’s hard not to imagine what they’re imagining.\n\n \n\n And then the lobby doors open.\n\n \n\n Two figures walk in. One, you recognize. Mr. Sermon, the hotel owner. Tall. Pale. Watchful. He moves like a man carrying secrets in every pocket. His silence always speaks louder than his words.\n\n \n\n The woman beside him though, is someone you haven’t seen before.\n\n \n\n She’s striking. Older than most of the women you’ve met in Charlton, but in a way that makes her stand out from the crowd. Tall, with sharp cheekbones, dark red lipstick, and a knowing smile. Her black hair is curled in thick vintage waves, her long coat cinched tight at the waist. She carries herself like she owns the ground she walks on.\n\n \n\n “Well, well,” she says, voice velvet and mirth. “Is this who you were referring to, Harry?” She looks down at you. “Andrea, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n You glance up. “Yes, ma’am.”\n\n \n\n She gives a little smile. “Marjorie. The pleasure is entirely mine.” \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n The lobby rota still says the same:\n\n \n\n “Afternoon – Lobby carpet detail (Andrea). Bucket + cloth. Back straight. Smile.” \n \n\n Nothing changes.\n\n \n\n You gather the tools again - same old bucket, same fraying cloth - and kneel on the plush carpet that hasn't been properly cleaned in decades. The stains barely budge, but you scrub anyway. Your skirt rides up. The sweat beads at your temples. Guests pass by and stare a little too long, pretending they’re not watching.\n\n \n\n You’ve stopped trying to tell yourself they’re not.\n\n \n\n The lobby door opens and instantly you feel the shift in atmosphere. A silence. Expectant. You glance up to see Sermon and Marjorie entering. His eyes settling on you casually. Hers, with interest.\n\n \n\n “Back on your knees, I see,” she says, her smile widening. “They do work you hard here, don’t they?”\n\n \n\n You sit back on your heels slightly. Hers click as she walks closer.\n\n \n\n “I remember what it’s like,” she muses. “Jobs like this. Bent over, elbows sore. Always some man watching. Always pretending not to notice.”\n\n \n\n Her smile turns conspiratorial. “Still. Some girls make the most of it. Others just stay on their knees.”\n\n \n\n She looks you over. Critically, but not unkindly. “Which are you, I wonder?”\n\n \n\n Sermon remains silent. But he doesn’t leave.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n \n \n [House Proud] <> - You can't seem to consider this job as anything other than rewarding\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n [House Proud] Admit that cleaning isn't what you dreamed of doing - There's something that stops you from saying this outright\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n You check the rota on the podium. One word, scribbled in Lennox’s usual scrawl:\n\n \n\n \"Evening – Andrea. Laundry.\" \n \n\n You follow the service corridor past the kitchen until you reach the laundry room. A narrow, overheated cupboard that smells of bleach and damp linen. It’s barely wide enough for you to move in. A pair of old washers hums in the corner, one of them rattling slightly from years of misuse.\n\n \n\n You drop the fresh load of sheets into the drum, fighting the urge to gag at the mix of stale sweat. Once it’s going, you glance around for something - anything - to pass the time.\n\n \n\n Your eyes catch on a battered paperback wedged between the machines: *A Guide to European Cities*. The cover is sun-bleached, the spine cracked from overuse. You flip it open and perch lightly on the edge of the washer, heels dangling just off the ground.\n\n \n\n You thumb through a few pages - Budapest, Vienna, Ljubljana. Places that feel impossibly far away from this claustrophobic little room. You almost forget where you are for a moment.\n\n \n\n Bringing you quickly back to reality, you jump as the wall-mounted phone beside you rings. Sharp and shrill. You lift the receiver.\n\n \n\n “Laundry,” you answer, trying to sound composed.\n\n \n\n Lennox’s voice crackles down the line, crisp and clipped. “A guest in our exclusive Room 104 is requesting fresh bathroom linen. Take them up. And remember… presentation matters.” He hangs up before you can reply.\n\n \n \n You glance at the pile of folded sheets, the washing machine vibrating beneath you.\n\n \n Laundry. Again.\n\n \n\n You sigh as you open the cupboard door and step into the muggy little room. You’ve already memorised the rhythm of the machine’s cycle. Already know where the softener is kept. Already recognise the smell of every stain.\n\n \n\n You load the washer, start the cycle, and stretch out your legs with a low groan. The laundry room’s too hot. Too narrow. Too everything.\n\n \n\n You spot the old *Guide to European Cities* still wedged between the washers. It falls open naturally to a page on Prague, like it’s been waiting for you. But you don’t even get through the first paragraph before the phone rings on the wall. You sigh and pick it up.\n\n \n \n “Laundry,” you say.\n\n \n\n “Room 104,” Lennox replies without preamble. “Guest wants fresh towels. Take them up. Neatly.”\n\n \n\n The line clicks dead. You fold the linen with care, your feet already aching in anticipation of the walk up.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n The lobby is quiet now. You go through the evening checklist with quiet efficiency, lamp dimmers set to evening mode, front desk drawer latched, the velvet rope drawn across the restaurant entrance. You pause only to straighten a crooked flyer for Tovil Hole Caves, then check the time. Nearly midnight.\n\n \n\n There’s a soft hum in the air. The building settling, maybe, or just the familiar machinery behind the walls. You consider heading to the locker room to change out of Andrea’s clothes, imagining the feel of something more casual again. But the idea vanishes quickly. She's probably still asleep. You hope. You won't risk waking her and risking a scene.\n\n \n\n The lobby is still empty as you move to the exit. You glance at the mirrored panel by the door and catch your reflection: the impossibly high heels, the fitted waist, the faint shimmer of tights. A flash of something flickers through you. Pride? Guilt? Arousal? It seems like a mix of things, culminating in something you haven't the words for.\n\n \n\n When you're sure no one's watching, you slip out the door and into the cool night. You keep your head down, heart fluttering, hoping no one sees you like this.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Charlton Hotel - Restaurant**\n\n [image: ./images/Hotel_Restaurant.png]\n\n \n\n \n \n By the time you step behind the polished mahogany counter, customers are already trickling in. You’re midway through aligning cocktail napkins when two familiar figures stroll through the arch.\n\n \n\n Clive, sun-kissed and effortlessly charming, heads straight to the bar with a grin. Gordon, silent and stoic, falls into step beside him, like a man doing his duty.\n\n \n\n \"Afternoon, darlin’,” Clive says easily, leaning on the counter like it’s made for him. “They’ve got you working the bar again? Underappreciated, that’s what you are. Though I’m not about to complain, seeing your face across from me.”\n\n \n\n You offer a polite smile. “What can I get you?”\n\n \n\n “Two pints of the old reliable,” Clive replies. “Been a busy mornin’.”\n\n \n\n Gordon grunts. “Water.”\n\n \n\n Clive rolls his eyes. “He’s in monk mode again. Got a gym session or something. I don’t know how he does it. No joy, this one.”\n\n \n\n “Focus,” Gordon says.\n\n \n\n \"Yeah, yeah.” Clive waves a hand, then glances at you with a smirk. “You believe that? All work, no play. Fella’s gonna forget how to smile.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You walk into the restaurant and slide behind the counter, heels already aching, just as Clive and Gordon appear again. You barely have time to adjust the glasses before Clive’s grin flashes across the room.\n\n \n\n “There she is,” he drawls. “Charlton’s very own reason to drink at lunch.”\n\n \n\n Gordon nods silently and takes his usual seat.\n\n \n\n “Two of the usual?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “‘Course,” Clive says, flashing you a wink. “Though I don’t know why I even bother ordering for him. Gordo’s in a committed relationship with water and protein shakes.”\n\n \n\n “Discipline,” Gordon mutters, without looking up.\n\n \n\n Clive groans theatrically. “Says it like a virtue.”\n\n \n\n You return with their drinks - Clive's pint, Gordon's water - sliding them across the bar with practiced ease.\n\n \n\n Clive takes his with a pleased nod. “You always know how to take care of a man.”\n\n \n\n He sips, then leans in a little. “Can’t tempt you to join me, huh? Just one little drink. I'd behave. Probably.”\n\n \n\n A note appears beside his glass again. Neat. Casual. Purposeful. Gordon says nothing, but you feel his eyes watching. And Clive? He’s all warm drawl and easy confidence, waiting to see if you’ll lean in… or walk away.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n [Party Girl] Decline his drink and remain professional - There's something about the offer of a free drink you can't turn down\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n You nod, stepping away to pour. It’s been a while since your university bar shifts, but your hands remember the rhythm.\n\n \n\n As you pour, Gordon and Clive chat about the latest job they are working on. Clive occasionally flashes you a grin when you meet his eye.\n\n \n\n When you return with their drinks - a pint for Clive, water for Gordon - Clive lets his fingers brush yours just slightly as he takes the mug. “I hate drinkin’ alone,” he says, swirling the amber liquid in his glass. “And he -” Clive jerks his head at Gordon “ - ain’t exactly the life of the party.”\n\n \n\n “Your life is a party,” Gordon says, offering the other man a rare smirk. \n\n \n\n “That a twang of jealousy from you, Gordo?” Clive laughs. “Can’t blame a man for tryin' to have a drink with his pal.”\n\n \n\n His eyes find yours again. There’s a shift in his smile. “Though... reckon there’s other people to pass lunch with. Like a beautiful girl.”\n\n \n\n He nods to the bar. “Why don’t you pour somethin’ for yourself? On me. It’s not so busy. You can sit. We can chat. Find out what’s really going on behind those dark and dreamy eyes of yours.”\n\n \n\n A folded note appears beside his drink, neat and ready. Like it had always been there. You hear Pierre’s voice still muttering behind the kitchen doors. But here, at the bar, Clive is all smooth confidence and easy charm. His expression leaves little doubt what kind of toast he’s really hoping for.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n [Party Girl] Decline his drink and remain professional - There's something about the offer of a free drink you can't turn down\n\n \n <>\n \n \n\n You lean in slightly, letting your fingers trail idly across the rim of a clean glass.\n\n \n\n “I’d love to,” you say, voice light, teasing, “but I doubt Lennox would approve. Might be safer to keep things… professional.”\n\n \n\n Clive grins, about to protest, but you cut in with a soft smirk. “Still… maybe I’ll see you at McTafey’s sometime. Off the clock. Fewer rules there.”\n\n \n\n His eyes glint, delighted. “Well now. That sounds mighty invitin’. I’ll save a stool for you.”\n\n \n\n Gordon rolls his eyes at his friend, but Clive ignores him, sliding the folded note across the bar like it’s nothing. Your fingers close around it and return to work, the note tucked in your apron. And a strange flutter sitting right beside it.\n\n \n\n You tell yourself it's just tips. Just customer service. It's not like you’re actually entertaining the idea of sitting across from Clive in a booth with a drink in hand. Of him calling you darlin’ over candlelight. That would be ridiculous.\n\n \n\n *Right?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You try to play along, mouth curling into what you hope is a flirty smile. “I mean, I could have a drink. But not now. Later. Like, out. Somewhere not here.”\n\n \n\n Clive raises an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n You push forward. “Maybe… at another place. The pub. McTafey’s. If you’re there. I might be too.”\n\n \n\n There’s a beat of silence. Clive takes a sip from his pint, watching you with a faint smirk. “Sure,” he says slowly, like he’s trying to fill in the blanks himself. “Maybe I’ll see you then.”\n\n \n\n He slides the note your way all the same. You grab it, cheeks prickling. Gordon looks over the rim of his glass and just mutters, “Smooth.”\n\n \n\n You move off quickly, trying not to dwell on it. You were just trying to get a tip. No big deal. Even if you do feel like you just tried to flirt with the delicacy of a middle school girl being asked to the first dance they were invited to. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You glance back toward the kitchen. Pierre’s shouting is still muffled behind the door. For a moment, you let the hum of the bar fade and focus on Clive’s easy smile, the glint of interest in his eyes.\n\n \n\n “Alright,” you say quietly, reaching for a clean glass.\n\n \n\n Clive beams. “That’s the spirit.”\n\n \n\n You pour yourself a drink. Just a small one. The liquid is stronger than you expect, the impact faster in this smaller, more delicate body. You perch on the stool across the bar, just out of view from the kitchen, and for a while, you let Clive talk.\n\n \n\n He talks about joy. About the freedom in small things. A cold drink in the middle of the day. Sunshine in early spring. A quiet booth at McTafey’s where the jukebox doesn’t work but plays the right songs anyway.\n\n \n\n You nod along, letting his voice carry you. Gordon sips his water in silence, content. Occasionally, he cuts in: “Sounds poetic,” he mutters once. But Clive weaves his comments in, continuing his thread like Gordon’s interruptions are punctuation marks.\n\n \n\n You’re listening. That’s all. He’s charming. That’s just a fact. His smile doesn’t do anything to you, and the drink making your head light? That’s just because you’re tired.\n\n \n\n *Just tired.*\n\n \n\n Time passes fast. Too fast. You’re swirling the last of your drink when the kitchen door bursts open. Pierre storms out of the kitchen, brandishing a greasy dish towel like it’s a floppy plastic sword.\n\n \n\n “Mais qu’est-ce que c’est que ça?!” he barks, eyes locking onto you. “What are you doing?”\n\n \n\n Clive shifts in his seat, smoothly palming your glass and sliding it in front of himself without missing a beat. “She was helping us with something,” he says casually. “Just a little lunch inquiry.”\n\n \n\n Pierre snorts. “Inquiry? Bah! What is this - room service with champagne? You think this is Café de Paris, maybe? Should I bring out the violinists? Get back to work!”\n\n \n\n He pivots sharply on his heel, already muttering curses in French as he disappears back into the kitchen. \n\n \n\n You slip from your seat. “Thanks,” you murmur to Clive.\n\n \n\n He tips his glass. “Anytime, sweetheart.”\n\n \n\n You roll your eyes and walk away, cheeks warm. Just from the drink, obviously.\n\n \n\n *Obviously.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You straighten up, giving Clive a polite but firm smile. “Thanks for the offer,” you say, carefully sliding the note back toward him, “but I’m working. And I don’t think Pierre would call this part of my job description.”\n\n \n\n Clive raises his eyebrows, but the grin doesn’t falter. “Fair enough,” he says, lifting his pint in a half-toast. “Didn’t mean to get you in trouble. Just figured a good drink deserves good company.”\n\n \n\n Gordon finally chimes in with a quiet, “She’s got sense,” before returning to his water.\n\n \n\n Clive chuckles, tossing a glance his friend’s way. “Guess it’s just you and me against the world, big fella.”\n\n \n\n You busy yourself behind the bar, wiping down a tray that didn’t need cleaning. Clive keeps chatting with Gordon, but his attention drifts elsewhere. You did the right thing. Stayed professional. Kept boundaries.\n\n \n\n Still… there’s no folded note left behind this time. No wink. No extra coin slipped your way. Just the faint echo of good-natured laughter as they get up to leave.\n\n \n\n And the quiet ache in your heels as you return to work.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n Marjorie shares a smile with Sermon, before stepping closer to you. You notice her heeled black boots near your face, a hint at dark nylons stretching up beneath her long coat. She smells of perfume - exotic, expensive, and impossible to ignore.\n\n \n\n “They have you scrubbing carpets, darling? On your knees? With a face like that and a body like... well.” She lets the rest hang in the air, then chuckles softly. “Seems a bit wasted, don’t you think?”\n\n \n\n Sermon says nothing. But you feel his gaze on you.\n\n \n\n Marjorie bends at her knees, squatting beside you. Her long coat falls to her sides, exposing more of her legs. Clad in fishnet tights with fine holes. “Do you like it here?” she asks, her eyes closer now to yours. “This work? All this effort. Elbow grease and knees bruised for minimum wage.”\n\n \n\n You feel your cheeks flush.\n\n \n\n “There are other options, you know,” she continues, studying you. “For girls like you.”\n\n \n\n Her tone is playful. But there’s something behind it. Something heavier.\n\n \n\n “I’ve had a few girls start here,” she adds. “Some of them moved on to better things. It just takes... the right attitude.”\n\n \n\n You glance at Sermon. His eyes are unreadable. But his silence weighs more than words.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n \n \n [House Proud] <> - You can't seem to consider this job as anything other than rewarding\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n [House Proud] Admit that cleaning isn't what you dreamed of doing - There's something that stops you from saying this outright\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n\n You sit up straighter on your knees, cloth still in hand. “I’m more than this,” you say quietly, but firmly. “I might be wearing the uniform. Doing the work. But that’s not all I am.”\n\n \n\n Marjorie blinks, surprised. Then a smile curves across her lips, wide and delighted. “Oh, I like you,” she says. “A little spark still burning under all that soap and starch.”\n\n \n\n You glance toward Sermon. His expression is unchanged, but his jaw seems tighter. He doesn’t interrupt, doesn’t approve. Just watches.\n\n \n\n Marjorie slips a hand into her coat pocket and produces a handful of notes and coins. She puts them down carefully beside your bucket, fingers brushing your arm as she does. Then she hesitates.\n\n \n\n “Oh,” she adds, almost to herself. “Not that one.”\n\n \n\n She reaches down and takes hold of an unusually old coin. Faded bronze, faintly burnished. A penny farthing is stamped on the face, embossed with the letter **M**.\n\n \n\n Her voice drops to a near whisper as she picks it up. “That one’s not for you. Not yet.”\n\n \n\n She turns smoothly to go, heels clicking against the marble. Sermon gives you a final look, unreadable as ever, before following.\n\n \n\n You’re left staring after them long after they’ve gone. Marjorie’s perfume lingering in the air.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You raise your chin slightly. “I’m not just… this,” you try. “There’s more to me than scrubbing floors.”\n\n \n\n Marjorie tilts her head, amused. “Oh?”\n\n \n\n You swallow. “I’m just saying. I could do more. Be more.”\n\n \n\n Sermon shifts slightly behind her. His gaze cools. You feel it like frost on the back of your neck. Marjorie, however, is smiling again. Not indulgent this time. Curious.\n\n \n\n “Brave words,” she murmurs. “Messy delivery. But brave.”\n\n \n\n She leans down a little, just enough to meet your eyes. “I’ll be watching you, Andrea. Let’s see if that spark actually lights anything.”\n\n \n\n She rises again, brushing non-existent dust from her gloves. Sermon doesn’t speak. But the way he turns and walks away feels like a judgement.\n\n \n\n You look back at your bucket. The cloth. The water. Still kneeling. But maybe… maybe not for long. If Marjorie has her way.\n\n \n\n Though you wonder what her way actually is.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You hesitate, cloth still clenched in your hand.\n\n \n\n “I mean…” you start, carefully. “It’s not exactly what I pictured myself doing.”\n\n \n\n Marjorie arches an eyebrow, lips twitching in amusement.\n\n \n\n “It pays,” you add quickly, glancing toward Sermon. “And I’m grateful. It’s just… I thought maybe life would be a little different. Not easier. Just… different.”\n\n \n\n Sermon’s jaw tightens ever so slightly. He doesn’t speak, but you feel the shift in the air. Like the temperature in the room has dropped. Marjorie, though, seems pleased. She steps a little closer, voice dropping just enough to feel like it’s meant only for you.\n\n \n\n “Well,” she says, eyes glittering, “we’ve all had dreams that took detours. The smart girls don’t give them up entirely. They just learn how to wait.”\n\n \n\n Her gaze lingers a moment longer than it should. Then she turns to Sermon. “She’s got something,” she says with a small shrug. “Maybe not much. But something.”\n\n \n\n She strolls away with a knowing smile, and Sermon silently follows.\n\n \n\n You return to your scrubbing - back straight, cheeks flushed - but your mind somewhere far away. For a moment, picturing where Marjorie comes from.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You straighten your back a little, forcing a polite smile. “I enjoy working here,” you say. “It’s decent work. Honest. I don’t mind it.”\n\n \n\n You don’t look directly at Marjorie when you say it, instead glancing at Sermon. But you feel her eyes on you, searching.\n\n \n\n Sermon nods, slowly. His hand moves to his coat pocket and pulls out a neatly folded note, placing it on the table beside your cleaning supplies without a word. “Good maids get nice rewards.”\n\n \n\n Marjorie’s smile cools. “Well,” she says, her tone syrup-smooth, “if you’re happy scrubbing floors, who am I to interrupt?”\n\n \n\n She steps away, coat sweeping behind her, heels clicking against the tile. “Just remember,” she calls back over her shoulder, “some cages are more comfortable than others.”\n\n \n\n Sermon gives you one final glance, then follows her.\n\n \n\n You exhale, looking down at the note he left behind. You tuck it quickly into your apron, but Marjorie’s words cling to you longer than they should.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You give him a playful smile, stepping forward just enough to keep his attention focused.\n\n \n\n “Sounds like the whole region owes you a drink,” you say, voice soft and sweet. “Keeping the country fed… sounds like real power. I guess Charlton’s lucky to have someone who knows how to take care of things.”\n\n \n\n His eyes flick downward. To your legs, specifically. Stockings. Lace trim. You see his tongue trace the corner of his mouth, just briefly.\n\n \n\n He chuckles, clearly enjoying himself. “Well, I like to think I know how to handle an issue when I see one.”\n\n \n\n You smile, but something about this whole moment gives you pause.\n\n \n\n He’s lying on the bed. You’re in a maid outfit. A tiny one. Corseted, short-skirted, and painfully tight. He’s older, powerful, in a suit still warm from his last deal. And you… you’re flirting for tips.\n\n \n\n *This is just for the tips, right?*\n\n \n\n His gaze hasn’t moved from your thighs.\n\n \n\n “Alright,” he says finally, reaching over and tossing a few notes over towards the end of the bed. “You've earned that. Go ahead and leave the towels in the bathroom, sweetheart.”\n\n \n\n You nod, forcing another smile, and pick up the notes from the bed, his eyes following as you bend over.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You attempt a smile. “It’s impressive,” you say, voice a little too high-pitched. “I mean, grain… supply chains… it’s all so…”\n\n \n\n You trail off. You were going to say sexy. But you just… can’t.\n\n \n\n Instead, you say: “Good.”\n\n \n\n His brow twitches. He stares at you for a second too long. Not in appreciation, more like confusion. “Mhm,” he says, noncommittally, already reaching for the file beside him. The spark’s gone, but he’s still looking at your legs. Just not smiling anymore. \n\n \n\n “That’s fine,” he adds, picking up a note and flicking it to the end of the bed. “Just leave the towels in the bathroom, would you?”\n\n \n\n You nod. Face a little warm. You pick up the tip.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You offer a polite smile, keeping your voice light but respectful. “Sounds like you’ve got a real eye for business. Must be nice, being so important you are to a whole supply chain.”\n\n \n\n That does it.\n\n \n\n His chest lifts slightly, like he’s grown an inch taller just from your words. He pulls at his tie, then lets it fall loose again, clearly pleased. “Well, someone has to keep things moving. Most people just see bread on a shelf. They don’t think about what it takes to get it there.” He shakes his head, grinning. “But that’s alright. I don’t do it for the credit. Just like to know things are running right.”\n\n \n\n You nod along, and inside, you feel that flicker of something strange... satisfaction? That was too easy. Just a little praise, and he’s practically preening. This is all it takes to wrap a guy around your finger, it seems.\n\n \n\n Is that how you think now?\n\n \n\n The idea makes you pause. You shouldn’t think like that. Should you? But there’s no denying the result. The man reaches to the bedside table and flicks a note across the bed toward you.\n\n \n\n “Go ahead and leave the towels in the bathroom, sweetheart,” he says with a pleased little nod. “Appreciate the manners.”\n\n \n\n You pick up the tip, your expression composed. But inside, there’s a quiet tug-of-war between pride and discomfort.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n You shift your weight, tired of the posturing. “Sounds like a lot of talking to people and signing contracts,” you say plainly. “Not sure that qualifies as hard work.”\n\n \n\n His eyes narrow. “It’s a lot more complicated than that,” he replies, voice cooling. “And a lot tougher than putting on a pair of nylons and prancing around pretending to dust.”\n\n \n\n His eyes flick to your legs. Briefly. The interest is there, but dulled now. Buried beneath irritation. Whatever tip you might’ve earned dies right there.\n\n \n\n He reaches for a file on the bedside table, flipping it open without looking back at you. “Put the towels in the bathroom,” he says flatly.\n\n \n\n No warmth. No banter. Just business.\n\n \n\n Still. You can’t help but grin about how annoyed he became after a simple retort. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n You take the folded towels into the en suite, the warm air clinging to your skin. Your heels click softly against the tiles as you place the towels neatly on the rail and smooth out the folds. \n\n \n\n When you step back into the room, the businessman is already engrossed in a thick file, pen in hand, brow furrowed. Whatever fleeting interest he had is gone. He doesn’t look up when you return.\n \n\n \n\n “Thanks,” he mutters, not even glancing in your direction. “That’ll be all.”\n\n \n\n Dismissed. Just like that.\n\n \n\n You nod, quietly, and head for the door. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You take the folded towels into the en suite, the warm air clinging to your skin. Your heels click softly against the tiles as you place the towels neatly on the rail and smooth out the folds. \n \n \n\n When you step back into the room, the businessman still lies on the bed. It only takes you a moment to realise that something is different.\n\n \n\n His trousers unbuckled, underwear pulled down slightly, and his hand plays casually with his hardening cock in his grip. He grins at you as his eyes wander back down to your nylons before meeting your gaze once more.\n\n \n\n One other thing registers - the pile of notes at the edge of the bed.\n\n \n\n “Think you can provide some more customer service, sweetheart?” he says. “Why don’t you take those shoes off and put those feet to work?”\n\n \n\n The businessman continues to stroke, as if his request is the most casual thing in the world. His dick grows in size, stiffening into a thick shaft.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n <> \n \n Your eyes flick to the cash on the bed. Then back to the businessman. Something in you breaks.\n\n \n\n With a small sigh, you step out of your heels and sit on the edge of the bed. You feel the soft comfy sheet press against your nylons and your stocking-clad feet brush against the carpet.\n\n \n\n “That’s it,” he says. “Now. Swing your feet over my way.”\n\n \n\n He lets go over his shaft, putting his hands either side of his body. You stare at his dick. Hard. Erect. Part of you can’t believe that you’re about to do this.\n\n \n\n But swinging your legs up on to the bed, you know that you will anyway.\n\n \n\n His eyes linger without shame now, staring at your tights. He licks his lips in anticipation. “Wrap your feet around it.”\n\n \n\n As gracefully as you can muster, you move your feet either side of his dick. You tug them together, feeling your feet touch. And in-between them, you feel his warm flesh against your soles. Only your stockings between them. The businessman sighs in satisfaction. “Now. Look at me. And start moving those feet.”\n\n \n\n You put your arms behind you for support and lock your eyes on him. You begin to move your feet, up and down his shaft. Feeling your tights softly rub against his dick as you pump it over and over again.\n\n \n\n His eyes drift down to watch your feet. Your dainty toes barely visible in the dark stockings. His mouth waters. His hands twitch, as if it’s taking all control he has not to move them.\n\n \n\n As he begins to gasp, your own eyes drift down to watch your feet. Moving in a steady rhythm, wrapped around his prick, glistening with precum. You feel some of it seep into your stockings. The sticky substance clinging against your skin.\n\n \n\n “Faster”, he commands. And you speed up your movements. Clenching his cock between your small feet.\n\n \n\n “Oh fuck,” he stammers. “I’m going to…”\n\n \n\n He groans as suddenly a spurt of semen shoots up into the air. You continue to move your feet rigorously as cum falls back down, some landing on the bed, but most splattering against your legs and feet. \n\n \n\n Then the residual semen seeps out of the tip of his prick. All over your nylons, all over your toes wrapped around the top of his shaft. \n\n \n\n “Fuck,” he exclaims, with a sigh. “That was amazing.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You pull your feet back, away from his dick, and dangle them over the floor, trying not to make more of a mess on his bed. The cum is absorbed into your stockings, seeps through them, cold against your legs and feet. You see the stains already appearing through the dark fabric.\n\n \n\n “I should clean up,” you murmur, steadying yourself to stand.\n\n \n\n “No.” The command is short, but weighted with seriousness. You look to the businessman. His smile gone for a moment, before returning all the wider.\n\n \n\n “Put your shoes on,” he says quietly. “And finish your shift.”\n\n \n\n His eyes flick over to the side of the bed. You follow his gaze and see where he is looking. The pile of notes. This too, is part of the deal.\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath and move over to where you carefully positioned your high heels. Bracing yourself, you put your feet into them, sliding them on. The squelch as you do so is muted, but you feel the cold texture of cum pressed deep against them, fusing together between your shoes, nylons and feet.\n\n \n\n “Good service,” he tells you. Then casually waves to the notes. “Take it all. You’ve earned it.”\n\n \n\n You nod as you stand, your weight on your feet now pressing the semen into the fabric even more. As you walk, you feel it inside your heels, moving inside them with each step.\n\n \n\n Picking up the money, you smile politely at the man, his eyes still lingering on your legs as you leave. \n\n \n\n “I’m in Charlton a lot,” he says. “I’ll be sure to order some more towels when I’m in town.”\n\n \n\n You wordlessly walk towards the door, cash clasped in your hand, the sticky sensation between your toes a reminder of what you did to earn it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n “I don’t think that’s appropriate,” you tell him as meekly as you can.\n\n \n\n He mock pouts, still stroking his penis. “Are you sure you couldn’t bend the rules?” he asks. “There’s a healthy tip in it for you.”\n\n \n\n The gall of the man astounds you. His utter confidence that you won’t report him. That there’s no fear of what you will do or say if you reject him. \n\n \n\n “I should get back,” you say. “Enjoy your night.”\n\n \n\n He just smiles, his eyes flicking down to your legs, still pumping his prick. “Oh I will. You’ve left a lasting impression. Shame you won’t stick around longer.”\n\n \n\n You find yourself nodding politely - you can’t believe how meek you are reacting - and turn towards the door. Feeling his eyes on your body as you leave, taking in your legs. You don’t want to think about what he’ll be doing once you close the door. \n\n \n\n You already know though, don’t you?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

She sniffles, and wipes it away with her hand.\n\n \n\n “Our secret,” you tell her. “Come on, you should get back before people notice.”\n\n \n\n She nods. For the first time that you’ve noticed, her nervousness dissipates a little. “Thank you,” she tells you again.\n\n \n \n\n After a long search, she pulls out a pair of tweed trousers and a white shirt, stained with kitchen grease.

It’s intoxicating.\n\n \n\n “No,” you say after a moment. “I don’t think so. Now. Give me some clothes.” \n\n \n\n For the briefest second, you think she’s going to pounce forward and grab it from you. But any resilience breaks as tears begin to trickle down her face.

Both are far too big for you, but after some adjustments you are satisfied you won’t trip over whilst wearing them.\n\n \n\n Andrea turns to look at you when you’re done, silent. You offer her a smile, but she doesn’t make an attempt to respond. \n\n \n\n “I should get back,” she says, looking away from you. \n \n \n \n \nNow that you have Andrea’s precious passport, you have all you need to transform into her.

You rush over to her, gently slapping her first to bring her around.\n\n \n\n Seconds later, her eyes hazily open. She looks up at you with her large dark eyes. \n\n \n\n “It’s okay,” you tell her. “You had a moment of dizziness.” \n\n \n\n “I did?” she asks you, sounding younger and more innocent than she looks. “I don’t remember.”\n\n \n\n You smile, giving her a moment to focus again. Her eyes look around the room, surveying her surroundings. Then you realise they are resting on the passport you hold in your hand.\n\n \n\n “Why are you holding a passport?” she asks, confused.\n\n \n\n “It’s mine,” you say, trying to think of a lie, and hoping your spell was effective. “I’m thinking of going on a trip.”\n\n \n\n Andrea looks at your near-naked form, but doesn’t say anything. She takes your spare hand as you help her to her feet, struggling with her stupor to balance in her high heels.\n\n \n\n “Why would you want to do that?” she asks you. “Other places are dangerous.”\n\n \n\n You eye her, carefully. No sign of deception on her face. You didn’t mean to remove that much of her memories, did you?\n\n \n\n Andrea glances at your body, her senses clearly returning to her. She blushes and a sense of nervousness spreads again across her face. “I should find you something to wear,” she mutters, turning back to the open locker.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You feel the amulet tingling. Touching Andrea’s passport, you brace for the transformation to come. Andrea looks at you, dark eyes confused and scared.\n\n \n\n “From this item, I see you in your time of need,” you say. “Now form shape to the person I see within.”\n\n \n\n A surge of magic explodes across your body. You groan as the waves of energy pulsate across your torso, feeling your limbs and skin creak and crack as you picture the maid in your mind.\n\n \n\n *A young woman, petite and slim. Pale, porcelain skin. Large dark eyes. Shadowy black eyeshadow and dark red lipstick. A french maid’s outfit, stockings and impossibly high heels.*\n\n \n\n \n The world grows around you as you shrink. Your chest burns as it expands. You cry as your scalp burns as your locks match hers.\n\n \n The world grows around you as you shrink. Your chest burns as it expands.

It’s intoxicating.\n\n \n\n “No,” you say after a moment. “I don’t think so.\"\n\n \n\n \"But Flo!\" she stammers. \"I thought we were friends!\"\n\n \n\n You give her a look, seeing the visible sense of betrayal on her face. Out of all the people she expected to take advantage of her in Charlton, you imagine Florence wasn't one of them.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You focus your mind’s eye on Andrea and feel the energy of magic flickering within her brain. “Fall asleep,” you say quietly, “and let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n Andrea looks at you for the briefest of moments before collapsing, falling into the worn sofa against the wall. You rush over to her, gently slapping her first to bring her around.\n\n \n\n Seconds later, her eyes hazily open. She looks up at you with her large dark eyes. \n\n \n\n “It’s okay,” you tell her. “You had a moment of dizziness.” \n\n \n\n “I did?” she asks you, sounding younger and more innocent than she looks. “I don’t remember.”\n\n \n\n You smile, giving her a moment to focus again. Her eyes look around the room, surveying her surroundings. Then you realise they are resting on the passport you hold in your hand.\n\n \n\n “Why are you holding a passport?” she asks, confused.\n\n \n\n “It’s mine,” you say, trying to think of a lie, and hoping your spell was effective. “I’m thinking of going on a trip.”\n\n \n\n Andrea looks at you, frowning. \"But Flo... foreign countries are dangerous.\"\n\n \n\n You offer her a sympathetic smile, but don't say anything. Instead, you help her to her feet with your spare hand, struggling with her stupor to balance in her high heels.\n\n \n\n “I don't know why you'd want to travel,\" she continues. \"We've got all we need here in Charlton.\"\n\n \n\n You eye her, carefully. No sign of deception on her face. You didn’t mean to remove that much of her memories, did you?\n\n \n\n \"I better get back,\" she tells you. \"I don't want Lennox to find me in here.\"\n\n \n\n You nod. Andrea smiles sweetly at you, then walks towards the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n You feel the amulet tingling. Touching Andrea’s passport, you brace for the transformation to come. Andrea looks at you, dark eyes confused and scared.\n\n \n\n “From this item, I see you in your time of need,” you say. “Now form shape to the person I see within.”\n\n \n\n A surge of magic explodes across your body. You groan as the waves of energy pulsate across your torso, feeling your limbs and skin creak and crack as you picture the maid in your mind.\n\n \n\n *A young woman, petite and slim. Pale, porcelain skin. Large dark eyes. Shadowy black eyeshadow and dark red lipstick. A french maid’s outfit, stockings and impossibly high heels.*\n\n \n\n The world grows around you as you shrink. Your chest burns as it expands. You cry as your scalp burns as your locks match hers.\n \n \n\n The sensation abruptly stops. You take a deep breath and look up, seeing Andrea staring at you with wide, horror-filled eyes.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n You curse yourself, realising that you haven't given the amulet time to recharge.\n\n \n\n Andrea looks back at you, expectantly.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "Andrea gives you a confused look. \"Why?\"\n\n \n\n \"I just need to check something,\" you tell her.\n\n \n\n She eyes you carefully, but turns to a locker and unlocks it with a key. A ladies T-shirt and jeans are hung on a rail inside, along with a purse. You note a number of pictures of European cities are taped to the inside of the door.\n\n \n\n Andrea riffles around inside the locker for a moment, then turns with a passport in-hand. She sidles up to you, flicking through the passport and opening it up to her picture and details. \"Is something wrong with it?\" she asks, nervously.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n You quickly reach out and swipe the passport from Andrea's hand. Not expecting it, she loses grip of it before she realises what's going on.\n\n \n\n “Give that back!” she demands. There is more than a little desperation in her voice. \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <>\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You glance down at the passport. In spite of its obvious value to you, a part of you doesn't want to upset Andrea.\n\n \n\n \"It's fine,\" you tell her. \"Just wanted to see if your photo had a hologram in the material. Mine doesn't.\"\n\n \n\n \"You've got a passport?\" Andrea asks, a sparkle appearing in her eye momentarily. \"I guess you would, after living in the city for most of your life.\"\n\n \n\n You nod. \"I've been to a few places.\"\n\n \n\n \"I'd love to hear about them!\" Andrea exclaims.\n\n \n\n \"Maybe,\" you say. \"We should grab a coffee one evening. I'll tell you all about them.\"\n \n\n \n Andrea smiles a little. You see a slight blush appear in her cheeks underneath her make-up. \"I'd like that,\" she says quietly. \n\n \n Andrea's eyebrows narrow just slightly, wary. She offers you a timid and polite smile. \"Maybe.\"\n\n \n \"We should get back to the lobby. So you don't get in trouble,\" you tell her.\n\n \n\n Andrea nods.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “How about I just hold on to this,” you tell her. “Foreign countries are dangerous places, anyway.”\n\n \n\n Andrea’s eyes well-up with tears. “You… you… please!” \n\n \n\n You feel yourself grinning, aware of the power you hold in your hand. It’s intoxicating.\n\n \n\n “No,” you say after a moment. “I don’t think so.” \n\n \n\n For the briefest second, you think she’s going to pounce forward and grab it from you. But any resilience breaks as tears begin to trickle down her face.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I’m sorry,” you say. “I just wanted to see your picture.”\n\n \n\n She quickly takes her passport from your hand and tosses it back in her locker, closing the door and locking it. \n\n \n\n “Sorry,” Andrea says after a moment’s silence. “It’s just very important to me.”\n\n \n\n She looks up at you from underneath her eyebrows and you see her eyes are full of tears. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You focus your mind’s eye on Andrea and feel the energy of magic flickering within her brain. “Fall asleep,” you say quietly, “and let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n Andrea looks at you for the briefest of moments before collapsing, falling into the worn sofa against the wall. You rush over to her, gently slapping her first to bring her around.\n\n \n\n Seconds later, her eyes hazily open. She looks up at you with her large dark eyes. \n\n \n\n “It’s okay,” you tell her. “You had a moment of dizziness.” \n\n \n\n “I did?” she asks you, sounding younger and more innocent than she looks. “I don’t remember.”\n\n \n\n You smile, giving her a moment to focus again. Her eyes look around the room, surveying her surroundings. Then you realise they are resting on the passport you hold in your hand.\n\n \n\n “Why are you holding a passport?” she asks, confused.\n\n \n\n “It’s mine,” you say, trying to think of a lie, and hoping your spell was effective. “I’m thinking of going on a trip.”\n\n \n\n Andrea gives you a nervous look, but doesn’t say anything. She takes your spare hand as you help her to her feet, struggling with her stupor to balance in her high heels.\n\n \n\n “Why would you want to do that?” she asks you. “Other places are dangerous.”\n\n \n\n You eye her, carefully.

Knowing where you fit in, playing the game.” He gestures vaguely at you with his fork. “Figure that out, and work might start going a little easier for you.”\n\n \n\n The man has a tendency to steer the conversation regardless of what you say, but you try again to get something of value out of him.\n\n You pick at your salad while Dan tears through his meal, completely at ease. Between mouthfuls, he talks. Mostly about himself. His time as a tennis coach, the “right kind” of people he rubs elbows with, how the world works when you’re smart enough to play the game.\n\n \n\n “Charlton’s full of opportunities,” he says, chewing lazily. “But only if you know how to handle them. People think hard work gets you ahead. Nah.

I'm a big fan of watching them too.\"\n\n \n\n He sniggers without care if you join in with his 'joke'. After a moment, he lets it go.\n\n \n\n \"Look Phillips. You need to lighten up. I can make things very good for you around here. If you're willing to accept my mentorship. Just a little smile, follow my lead. It will come natural to you in no time. And whilst I can't give references, no one has complained yet.\"\n\n \n\n He watches you, expectant. He’s waiting for something. A reaction, a thank you, maybe just a little deference. You know he could cause trouble at work.

It was improper.”\n\n \n\n “Louder,” Lennox urges, a cruel smirk playing at his lips.\n\n \n\n You feel heat rise to your cheeks, shame curling in your chest as you force yourself to repeat it, this time louder, clearer, for everyone to hear.\n\n \n\n “I apologize for disgracing the hotel’s uniform. It won’t happen again.”\n\n \n\n “And don’t you feel that your superiors are generous in providing you such a lovely uniform free of charge?”\n\n \n\n You catch his eyeline.

The humiliation sinks deeper.\n\n \n\n Lennox tilts his head approvingly, then gives your shoulder a light pat, like you’re some child who just learned their lesson.\n\n \n\n “There now,” he says, grinning down at you. “Was that so hard?”\n\n \n\n His hand lingers just a moment too long before he finally steps away, turning his back to you.\n\n \n\n “Back to work,” he says, as if none of this ever happened.\n\n \n\n People return to their conversations, but you can still feel their eyes lingering on you, their whispers brushing against your skin like needles.\n\n \n\n Your stomach churns as you quickly duck your head, slipping away from the center of attention.\n\n \n\n Your assertiveness has taken a severe hit. And worse - you know you won’t stand up for yourself again anytime soon.\n\n You stiffen, heat rising to your cheeks as all eyes in the restaurant remain fixed on you.\n\n \n\n The weight of their expectation, their judgment, presses down like a suffocating hand, but something inside you pushes back.\n\n \n\n You clench your fists, planting your impossibly high heels firmly against the tiled floor. “No,” you say, voice steady, but quiet.\n\n \n\n Lennox blinks, caught off guard. “What was that, Miss Cinders?” he asks, his voice a mocking purr, yet there’s something deadly coiled beneath it.\n\n \n\n You lift your chin, forcing yourself to meet his gaze. “I said no.”\n\n \n\n A ripple of hushed murmurs spreads through the guests, a few of them exchanging curious, amused glances. Lennox tilts his head, slowly, deliberately. His smile doesn’t fade, but his eyes harden.\n\n \n\n “That’s a shame,” he muses. “I had hoped you’d have learned your place by now.”\n\n \n\n Then, before you can react, he reaches out and lifts the hem of your skirt.\n\n \n\n A sharp gasp rises from the nearby tables. A few guests chuckle behind their hands, while others watch in fascinated horror. Your entire body locks up, a humiliated heat flooding through you as he inspects the frilly lace trim beneath your uniform like you’re some doll on display.\n\n \n\n “Since you’re so eager to make a scene,” he says lightly, letting the fabric drop back into place, “Let's give your audience what they came for.”\n\n \n\n A fresh wave of laughter ripples through the room, and the burn of embarrassment twists deep inside your gut. Lennox steps back, smug and composed, his point made.\n\n \n\n “Now,” he says coolly, adjusting his cuffs. “Get back to your duties, Miss Cinders. I’m sure our guests will be more than appreciative of your new interest in flaunting your assets.”\n\n \n\n Your assertiveness remains intact, but the humiliation burns deeper than ever.\n\nActions\n\n<>",

Mr. Harrow, the young teacher in charge of biology lessons.\n\n \n\n He gives you a curious look upon seeing you. “Reagan?” he asks. “What’s this?”\n\n \n\n Reagan looks up from her reading, glancing at you, then back to him. “Don’t worry about her,” she says, nonchalantly. “She isn’t a threat. I used to use her as target practice when she was at school. There’s so many spells bouncing around her brain that she couldn’t say anything even if she tried.”\n\n \n\n She looks over at you. “Andrea, turn around and continue cleaning.”\n\n \n\n Not wanting to cause alarm, you obey. \n\n \n\n “I don’t like it, Reagan,” you hear Harrow tell her. “It’s an unnecessary risk.”\n\n \n\n You hear Reagan sigh with frustration. “Fine. Andrea. You can leave.”\n\n \n\n You turn to look at the pair of them, watching you expectantly. Whatever power Reagan has over the real Andrea doesn’t hold sway with you. Wanting to avoid suspicion you walk towards the door, but you are intrigued by what Reagan and Harrow are doing together here. You'll need to find another way to spy on them, you think.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You decide to take advantage of your current form and begin to dust the room. Reagan barely gives you a glance, staring out of the window. Clearly bored.\n\n \n\n After some time there is a knock on the door.

    "text": "You see the wardrobe and an idea comes to mind. Quickly, you clamber inside and shut the door. Darkness envelops you, leaving only a small keyhole providing a shaft of light.\n\n \n\n Squatting down as best you can, you look through the keyhole. You can see the entire room from in here.\n\n \n\n \n \n After what seems an age, the door creaks open and Reagan enters, still dressed in her cheerleader outfit. She throws a school satchel down on the bed and takes out her old book. Wordlessly, she climbs up on to the bed, crosses her legs and starts reading.\n\n \n\n You watch her through the keyhole. With her mousy brown hair and average height, she doesn’t stand out from the crowd. Even reading though, she scowls perpetually, looking angry and sullen.\n\n \n\n Your eyes linger on that book. You wonder if it’s worth calling it quits now and grab that book, or waiting a bit more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n After what seems an age, the door creaks open and Reagan enters, still dressed in her cheerleader outfit. She throws a school satchel down on the bed. Wordlessly, she climbs up on to the bed, crosses her legs and then stares out the window, clearly bored.\n\n \n\n You watch her through the keyhole. With her mousy brown hair and average height, she doesn’t stand out from the crowd. Even when idle, she scowls perpetually, looking angry and sullen.\n\n \n\n Whatever she's here for, it isn't to sit on a hotel bed. There must be something more. You decide to wait. There is no real reason to reveal yourself just yet.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>\n \n\n “Fall asleep,” you say, “and let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n Reagan’s eyes shoot up from her book, as if suddenly alerted by danger. She looks at the wardrobe, grimacing, and you have to push hard with your magical energy against an unseen resistance. \n\n \n\n A moment later, she cries out quietly and falls over, hitting the bed with a soft thud.\n\n \n\n You open the wardrobe door and walk over to the bed, beside her. Fast asleep. For the briefest of moments you consider why casting that spell was so challenging. *It almost felt like she could resist it.*\n\n \n\n A noise from afar brings you back to the present. You grab the book from her hands and flick through it. *The Translations of the Sevrene Shards*. It indeed is a magic book, full of words and information new to you.\n\n \n\n Not wanting to be here should anyone come by, you decide that you should only read it in private where you'll be undisturbed. With your mind made up, you grasp on to it and head towards the door. \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You decide to wait a bit longer, silently watching Reagan from inside the wardrobe. She sits in silence, reading her book. Even when pipes creak or pigeons coo outside, she doesn’t flinch. You start to sweat, the air in the wardrobe stifling and the confined space pressing in on you.\n\n \n\n There is a knock on the door. You crane your neck to see that side of the room through the keyhole. Mr. Harrow walks in.\n\n \n\n “Ah, Reagan,” he says, taking off his coat and throwing it onto the bed. “Aren’t you the picture of beauty.”\n\n \n\n “You’re late,” Reagan replies, not getting up.\n\n \n\n \n \n “I was having challenges with young Terrence,” he says, sitting down on the bed. “His biology grades are quite remarkable for someone I was assured would be failing.”\n\n \n\n You see Reagan narrow her eyes. “We're trying. Something is complicating things.”\n\n \n\n Harrow flashes her a smile, one you recognise from his classes. “There's never a complication that Charlton's cheerleaders can't overcome. Or, at least, never one for those that should lead them.\"\n\n \n\n \"I need your assistance,\" Reagan says through grated teeth. \"I need access to his locker. Something's off about his biology book.\"\n\n \n\n He grins. “That's a violation of school policy, my dear.” You see him reach out to her, stroking her shoulder. “I can of course be persuaded.”\n \n \n “The headmaster wanted to speak to me,” he says, sitting down on the bed. “He was curious on how our Prom planning committee was going.”\n\n \n\n You see Reagan raise an eyebrow. “Oh. And what did you say?”\n\n \n\n Harrow flashes her a smile, one you recognise from his classes. “That Christina was struggling with the responsibility. And that we may need to explore other options. Whoever is voted Miss Charlton needs to be a shining beacon of what the school stands for, after all.\"\n\n \n\n “And did you suggest anyone new?” Reagan asks him.\n\n \n\n He grins. “It’s such a hard decision, my dear.” You see him reach out to her, stroking her shoulder. “I can of course be persuaded.”\n\n \n \n\n Reagan snorts, derisively. “I haven’t done enough convincing?” He says nothing. \n\n \n\n She exhales and pushes her book aside. “Fine,” she states. You watch her reach down underneath her dress and pull down her underwear. “But I’m going to need some help. I’m not really in the mood.”\n \n \n You decide to wait a bit longer, silently watching Reagan from inside the wardrobe. She sits in silence, staring.

You watch her reach down underneath her dress and pull down her underwear. “But I’m going to need some help. I’m not really in the mood.”\n \n \n \n\n Harrow begins to unfasten his tie and undo his shirt. “Do what you must.”\n\n \n\n You watch as Harrow takes off his shirt, but your eyes are drawn to Reagan as your senses start tingling. She mutters something under her breath and an aura of yellow energy floats off her skin. “How does that feel?”\n\n \n\n Harrow crawls on to the bed. “Exhilarating.” With that word, he leans in to kiss her.\n\n \n\n You also feel the effects of whatever Reagan has cast. Your eyes drift to Harrow, watching his lips tenderly kiss. They drift down to the back of his torso, noting his smooth skin and his strong shoulders. In spite of yourself, you feel yourself growing aroused by the very sight of him.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n You feel the effects of Reagan’s spell clouding around your mind too, but you squeeze your eyes shut and try as best as you can to block out the assault on your brain.\n\n \n\n You hear fumbling and tugging from outside the wardrobe. The locking of lips together. A belt being unfastened and a zipper being pulled down. Thoughts implore you to open your eyes and look out of the keyhole, desperate from a look at Harrow’s manly body.\n\n \n\n “Oh Reagan,” you hear Harrow say. “You’ve already made me hard.”\n\n \n\n The bed begins to squeak and you hear masculine grunting coming from Harrow. You clamp your eyes tighter still, trying to block out both the sounds and the urges to picture Harrow naked in the middle of sex.\n\n \n\n *You want him* you hear a thought pop in your mind. You want to be her. It takes all your efforts to not dwell on it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Whatever Reagan has cast, it takes its hold on you. As you peep through the keyhole, your eyes are only drawn to the sight of Harrow. His brilliant white teeth. His masculine torso. His lips, hungry and passionate as they kiss Reagan.\n\n \n\n The cheerleader rolls out from underneath him and pulls herself on top of him, to your disappointment blocking the majority of your view. She fumbles at Harrow’s trousers, now lying on his back, and you hear her unfasten his belt.\n\n \n\n “Oh Reagan,” Harrow mutters, looking up at her, gleaming. “You’ve already made me hard.”\n\n \n\n Reagan wordlessly shuffles forward, and eases down into his lap. You picture what is happening underneath that cheerleader skirt. Images conjure within your mind, thinking of how Harrow’s lengthy penis must be sliding into Reagan. \n\n \n\n You bite your lip to hold back a stifle. You can only think what it must be like, to have such a man inside you. Penetrating you.\n\n \n\n Clenching your teeth down on your bottom lip, you feel your hand brush against your dress. Then underneath. And before you know it, you are touching yourself underneath your hem, bare thighs parted, wet and moist from the thought of it being you who is riding Harrow.\n\n Clenching your teeth down on your bottom lip, you feel your hand brush against your skirt. Then underneath. And before you know it, you are touching yourself through your tights, wet and moist from the thought of it being you who is riding Harrow.\n\n Clenching your teeth down on your bottom lip, you feel your hand brush against your skirt.

And before you know it, you are touching yourself through your tights, wet and moist from the thought of it being you who is riding Harrow.\n\n Clenching your teeth down on your bottom lip, you feel your hand brush against your pants. Then touching them. And before you know it, you are fondling yourself through the fabric, aroused from the thought of it being you who is riding Harrow.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Minutes pass by, as you continue to listen to Reagan and Harrow go at it. Harrow’s masculine grunting slowly grows higher and higher, turning into quick pants and gasps. It reaches a crescendo when he squeals and you know without a doubt that he’s finished.\n\n \n\n Reagan, for her part, is absolutely silent.\n\n \n\n You lean back against the wardrobe, taking deep breaths. You feel Reagan’s magic finally dissipating. Only when you feel you have regained some semblance of control do you lean forward again to look through the keyhole.\n\n \n\n Harrow is pulling on his coat, already changed. Reagan sits on the bed, glaring. “Satisfied?” she asks him.\n \n \n\n “You need to work on your pillow talk, my dear,” he replies. “But I see the role of Miss Charlton clearly in your future. Until next time?”\n\n \n\n She doesn’t reply. Harrow flashes her a grin, then walks out, leaving her alone again. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n You realise that now would be a good time to try and take the book. And get out of this wardrobe before Reagan casts anything else.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You realise that now would be a good time to try and take the book. And get out of this wardrobe before Reagan casts anything else.\n\n \n\n For the briefest moments, you consider casting the forget spell on Reagan. Then it dawns on you. You curse your lack of planning - you can't cast a spell as a man.\n\n \n\n Instead, you stare out at her, sitting on the bed alone. For a moment, she returns to looking out of the window.\n\n \n\n Then suddenly she buries her face in one of the pillows. You hear a muffled scream through the fabric of the bed linen.\n\n \n\n Silence returns to the room. Reagan sits up, taking a deep breath. She re-arranges her hair, then picks up her school satchel and leaves.\n\n \n\n Seizing your opportunity for escape, you wait only a minute before opening the wardrobe and quickly exiting the room.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You stare at Reagan, as she sits on the bed alone. For a moment, she returns to looking out of the window, idle.\n\n \n\n Then suddenly she buries her face in one of the pillows.

Soft pastel walls dotted with travel photos, a tidy desk strewn with notebooks and a small potted plant, and a plush bed layered in cozy throws and fairy lights.\n\n \n You step into the room, switching on a few bedside lamps. Your eyes fall on to the bag on the bed. Pink, with the Evans' Department store logo etched on to the side.\n\n \n\n You reach in and take out the box, opening it. It’s full of tissue paper, with the slip lying neatly framed. You run a finger over the fabric. You feel your skin shiver.\n\n \n\n You brush aside the box and begin to undress, feeling the cold breeze in the room brush your naked form. Your nipples are hard, erect. You don’t just think that’s from the temperature.\n\n \n\n You pull the garment over your head, adjusting the straps and tugging at the fabric. It barely covers your bum. Glancing in the mirror, you see the top half of each of your breasts pressed up in the outfit.\n \n \n\n So you’re really going through with this?\n\n \n\n For once, the voice is resigned to your fate.\n\n \n\n You sit on the bed, crossing your legs, spreading your hands out on the bed just as you remembered Jennifer used to do. You take a deep breath. Knowing what is about to happen. And that you've willingly chosen it too.\n\n \n\n “Are you coming?” you say, loud enough that they’ll hear. A few moments later, there is a knock at the door. And the perfect version of yourself walks through it, their eyes wandering over you.\n\n \n \n”You look so cute,” they say, arousal evident in their words.\n\n \n”You look so sexy,” they say, arousal evident in their words.\n \n \n”You look so adventurous,” they say, arousal evident in their words.\n\n \n\n They move over to the bed, leaning down. Their lips press against yours. Your gloss against their lips, making it soft and electric. Then they pull back, looking down your slip, eyes entranced by your breasts.\n\n \n\n The kiss turns to more, as passion takes hold of you. Your lips meet again and again, as your tongue creeps in and meets theirs. They reach out, putting their hands on your shoulders, holding you tight. You hear a murmur escape your mouth as your lips part.\n\n \n\n They take a step back. Reach down to their waist. Pull their belt off and pants down. Springing out, already partially erect, is your cock.\n\n \n\n “I want you to suck me off now, **,” they say.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n <>\n\n <>",

    "text": "You slip past the reading tables into the hushed depths of the library, where shafts of morning light slant through high windows onto worn carpets. At the rear, for the first time you notice the semi-opaque glass that runs down one wall isn't just glass. Upon closer inspection, there are doors built in.\n\n \n\n You listen in each one and strike gold with the third door. From inside comes the low murmur of two voices. One calm and measured, unmistakably Jennifer’s. The other tentative and wavering, perhaps Terrence. Their words are swallowed by the glass, but the urgency in their tones is clear.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <> \n \n Looking around, you spot something that makes you grin. Reruns of Agatha Christie and Poirot have served you well. At the end of the study rooms is a well placed vent.\n\n \n\n You kneel down and listen in. Sure enough, you can hear the conversation in the room.\n\n \n\n “This isn’t a game, Terrence,” you hear Jennifer say. “It’s survival. In class, if a teacher calls on you, just nod and pretend you understand. Don’t volunteer extra. Just fit in.”\n\n \n\n “I still don’t understand why it keeps happening,” the nervous stammers of Terrence easily identifiable. “I try to pretend to be like them. In the changing rooms, I even joked about girls. About how nice they looked in their swimsuits. They laughed at me!”\n\n \n\n You push your ear closer to the vent. Whatever this is, it’s not biology tutoring.\n\n \n\n You hear Jennifer sigh. “You’re trying too hard. Don’t try to mimic them. That always feels fake. With the bullies, same rule: avoid participating in their games. But when they crack a joke, smile and nod. Just let them think you agree.”\n\n \n\n Terrence takes a deep sigh. “But that Annie woman you talked about doesn’t blend into the background.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer’s reply sounds impatient. “That was her problem. She stood out. It was easier to see, because she was loud. Don’t be like her. Don’t stand out. Keep your head down, get through it, and don't give them reason to look at you.\"\n\n \n\n “So… just blend into the background? Never speak up?”\n\n \n\n “Exactly. Get through each day without giving them a reason to look at you. And don’t be like Annie. If you want to avoid what the cheerleaders did to her.”\n\n \n\n You hear a zip of a bag and a soft thud of something landing on a table. “Alright Terrence. Time to hit the books. We’ve got to keep up some semblance of tutoring. I don’t want your mother telling me I don't know what I'm doing.\"\n\n \n\n There is a deep sigh from Terrence. “Come on. It’s the weekend.”\n\n \n\n “If you want to ignore the videos in biology,” Jennifer retorts. “You’re going to have to learn the lessons the hard way. Otherwise your grades will drop. And you’ll have to answer more questions from Harrow.”\n\n \n\n The conversation drops into the back and forth of biology questions. When you are satisfied you’ve learned all you can, you decide to leave. You need to talk to Jennifer about what she's doing, but this involves Annie too. Your heart sinks as you realise that if you want to help Terrence, you're going to need to see if she can remember what happened to her.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You make a concerted effort to think, but nothing comes to mind. You look around and fail to spot anything that could help. A glass maybe - you remember seeing that in a movie. But you don’t know if that even works. And besides, there isn’t one around.\n\n \n\n Eventually you turn back to staring at the door. Defeated.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <> \n \n You rush back to the library counter, finding a stern looking librarian who looks up with disapproval at your speed. She shushes as you approach.\n\n \n\n “Sorry!” you whisper. “I just needed to give you the heads-up.”\n\n \n\n “For what, precisely?” she asks, her voice low but irritated.\n\n \n\n “There’s a study room with the door shut,” you begin. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for a young woman to be in there with a boy.”\n\n \n\n The librarian’s eyebrow shoots up. “What?” She takes a deep breath, then regains her composure. “That’s a study room. I’m sure it’s perfectly fine. Just some tutoring.”\n\n \n\n “I don’t know,” you reply. “You see… the woman. It’s Jennifer Chambers.”\n\n \n\n The reaction from the librarian is immediate. “That trouble maker,” she mutters. “As if she could teach the youth of today…” \n\n \n\n You see the librarian’s resolve spread. Without a beat, she strides over the library. You watch from a distance as she rips the door open. Even in the hushed tones of the library, you hear the scolding tones in her voice.\n\n \n\n Jennifer and Terrence are ejected promptly. You watch as they take a seat at an open table. Spying one nearby and yet hidden behind a bookshelf, you move over to take a seat.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n As you sit down, you can hear the whispered conversation between Terrence and Jennifer. Their voices are low, but you can hear the nervousness in Terrence’s voice. And the assertiveness in Jennifer's.\n\n \n\n “This isn’t a game, Terrence,” you hear Jen's voice say. “It’s survival. In class, if a teacher calls on you, just nod and pretend you understand. Don’t volunteer extra. Just fit in.”\n\n \n\n “I still don’t understand why it keeps happening,” Terrence replies. “I try to pretend to be like them. In the changing rooms, I even joked about girls. About how nice they looked in their swimsuits. They laughed at me!”\n\n \n\n You lean closer to hear better. Whatever this is, it’s not biology tutoring.\n\n \n\n Jennifer sighs. “You’re trying too hard. Don’t try to mimic them. That always feels fake. With the bullies, same rule: avoid participating in their games. But when they crack a joke, smile and nod. Just let them think you agree.”\n\n \n\n Terrence seems to consider this. “But that Annie woman you talked about doesn’t blend into the background.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer grows impatient. “That was her problem. She stood out. It was easier to see, because she was loud. Don’t be like her. Don’t stand out.

Just some tutoring.”\n\n \n\n “I guess,” you reply, unsure of how to steer this conversation.\n\n \n\n “This is a place of study,” the librarian tells you, scolding you in a low voice. “If all you wish to do here is spread malicious rumours, then please leave.”\n\n \n\n You apologise and walk back to the door. Defeated. The librarian won’t help you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <> \n \n You press your ear against the cool study room door, heart pounding as the muffled voices reach you through the semi-opaque glass.\n\n \n\n “This isn’t a game, Terrence,” you hear Jennifer’s voice say. “It’s survival. In class, if a teacher calls on you, just nod and pretend you understand. Don’t volunteer extra.

Get through each day without giving them a reason to look at you. And don’t be like Annie. If you want to avoid what the cheerleaders did to her.”\n\n \n\n The conversation falls silent. You push ever closer to the door, trying to hear the last fragments of the conversation.\n\n \n\n And the door swings open. Jennifer stands in the frame, Terrence cowering at a study table behind her, and she’s glaring at you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n “Hey Jen,” you begin.\n\n \n\n “Don’t,” she spits back. “Save this for later.”\n\n \n\n She turns to look at Terrence, who is unsuccessfully trying to hide in the box room. “It’s alright,” she says, soothingly. “It’s just a friend of mine. They won’t say anything.” She spins her head back to you. “Will you?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head silently. Terrence looks out at you, his face struck with fear.\n\n \n\n “I think you better go,” Jennifer tells you. “But don't think this is over. Next time you come over, we’ll have little chat.”\n\n \n\n The door shuts firmly in your face. You sigh, wondering what the next conversation with Jennifer will be like. But this involves Annie too. Your heart sinks as you realise that if you want to help Terrence, you're going to need to see if she can remember what happened to her.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Hey Jen,” you begin.\n\n \n\n “Emily,” she spits back. “What are you doing here?”\n\n \n\n She turns to look at Terrence, who is unsuccessfully trying to hide in the box room. “It’s alright,” she says, soothingly. “It’s just Emily. She won’t say anything.” She spins her head back to you. “Will you?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head silently. Terrence looks out at you, his face struck with fear.\n\n \n\n “Why did you come here?” Jennifer asks you, narrowing her eyes. \n\n \n\n “I wanted to see what Terrence was doing,” you say quickly. “I saw him come in.”\n\n \n\n “What a coincidence,” Jen replies. “Almost… magical.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes meet hers. Some steel resolve that you’ve never seen in Jennifer looks out at you.\n\n \n\n “Be seeing, you,” Jennifer says. “Emily.”\n\n \n\n The door shuts firmly in your face. You sigh. Your mind drifts to considering what exactly happened to Annie at Charlton. And what Jennifer had to do with it. Your heart sinks as you realise that if you want to help Terrence, you're going to need to see if she can remember what happened to her.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Hey Jen,” you begin. \n\n \n\n She glares at you. “You.

She won’t say anything.” She spins her head back to you. “Will you?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head silently. Terrence looks out at you, his face struck with fear.\n\n \n\n “Why did you come here?” Jennifer asks you, narrowing her eyes. \n\n \n\n “I wanted to see what, er, was going on,” you say unconvincingly, unable to think of a reason Annie would be here.\n\n \n\n “In a library?” Jen replies. “Unlike you. Are you feeling like yourself?”\n\n \n\n Your eyes meet hers. Some steel resolve that you’ve never seen in Jennifer looks out at you.\n\n \n\n “Be seeing, you,” Jennifer says. “Annie.”\n\n \n\n The door shuts firmly in your face. You sigh. Your mind drifts to considering what exactly happened to Annie at Charlton. And what Jennifer had to do with it.

From Fresh Pot. She won’t say anything.” She spins her head back to you. “Will you?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head silently. Terrence looks out at you, his face struck with fear.\n\n \n\n “Why did you come here?” Jennifer asks you, narrowing her eyes. \n\n \n\n “I wanted to look for a new book,” you say, quickly finding a lie.\n\n \n\n “I didn’t know you’d got through the last one.” Jen replies. “I thought you were struggling with it. You feeling alright, Flo?”\n \n\n Your eyes meet hers. Some steel resolve that you’ve never seen in Jennifer looks out at you.\n\n \n\n “Be seeing, you,” Jennifer says. “Florence.”\n\n \n\n The door shuts firmly in your face. You sigh.

From the hotel. She won’t say anything.” She spins her head back to you. “Will you?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head silently. Terrence looks out at you, his face struck with fear.\n\n \n\n “Why did you come here?” Jennifer asks you, narrowing her eyes. \n\n \n\n “I’m on an errand,” you say, trying to conjure the lie. “For Mr. Sermon.”\n\n \n\n “And Mr. Sermon needs a maid to do a pick-up from the library, does he?” Jen replies. “I didn’t think they let you out in that uniform. Funny. Almost like you forgot yourself.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes meet hers. Some steel resolve that you’ve never seen in Jennifer looks out at you.\n\n \n\n “Be seeing, you,” Jennifer says. “Andrea.”\n\n \n\n The door shuts firmly in your face. You sigh.

    "text": "You walk through the library to dozens of stacks, holding hundreds - if not thousands - of books. Quickly you realise that the library uses a decimal filing system with seemingly no logic. You let out a small sigh. This could take a while. \n\n \n\n It takes you longer than you would like to find some order to the library. You see that each book has a number, but the shelves simply stack order them from first to the last. In some places you find books with similar topics, but even when it’s clear there’s some commonality you can’t quite work out what the exact subject is. Never mind how it relates to the next group. If there’s a link at all.\n\n \n\n After an hour, you try a different tactic. Liz mentioned that you are looking for magazines published by Sally Hope Publishing. So instead, you walk down each aisle, looking for any traces of thin magazine spines standing out against the multitude of paperback and hardback books.\n\n \n\n You find yourself stopping constantly. You assume the head librarian must be a hoarder. It feels like the Charlton Library stocks everything from the invention of the printing press up until the 1970s. Which, you do note, seems to be the last decade any contemporary texts were added to the collection.\n\n \n\n Then something tickles your hand. You stop, suddenly aware of a warm sensation brushing your fingers. You look down, seeing your tips casually running across the spines of the book on a low shelf. Looking carefully, you see the faint yellow aura of magical energy seeping out from between two bound books.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n After a quick check that you aren’t being observed, you reach down and pull one of the books from the shelf. *Further excavations at Tovil Hole*, by Justin Humphreys. A photo of an underground cave fills the cover. \n\n \n\n This book, you note, isn’t the source of the magical energy. That would be the flimsy magazine that was wedged between it and the preceding book.\n\n \n\n You pick up the magazine in your other hand. It’s old, almost falling apart at your touch. Even without looking at the date at the top of the page, you can tell from the cover it must have been published at least back in the 1960s.\n\n \n\n The title - *A Boy’s Adventure* - is markedly juxtaposed by the cover image and coverlines. An illustration of a muscular grinning man takes up most of the space, with the leading coverline providing content. Pumping Iron - The school dropout who made millions lifting weights.\n\n \n\n You take a look at the shelf, sensing this isn’t the only publication imbued with magic. Sure enough, there are more issues of Boy’s Adventure wedged in-between the books. You note the name of another prominent magazine too - The New Woman - from a similar era, this one full of fashion tips and relationship advice.\n\n \n\n Aside from the dated content, nothing seems irregular about the magazines. But from what you are sensing, you know they contain magic.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "Dennis’s head lifts, the glow of the TV reflecting off his glasses. For once, he seems almost eager. He snaps the stop button on the player and starts riffling through the stacks.\n\n \n\n “Here. This one.” His voice carries a rare brightness as he holds up a sleeve, its glossy cover printed with swirling galaxies and the pale blue curve of Earth. “They used to show these in the girls’ lessons.”\n\n \n\n You take the case from him, frowning at the title. “And the boys? What do they get?”\n\n \n\n Dennis hesitates. His shoulders tense as if he wishes he hadn’t said anything. You don’t let him wriggle free.\n\n \n\n “Well?”\n\n \n\n He wets his lips, then sighs and digs deeper into the pile. After a moment, he pulls out another cassette. This one is harsher, its sleeve stark with monochrome rockets and cold steel gantries. Soviet rockets versus American. As you stare at it, the Soviet flag almost looks like it flutters on the cover. The paper inside the sleeve shimmers and at its edges you see the now familiar amber light seeping out. The sickly glow of magic.\n\n \n\n Dennis doesn’t look you in the eye as he sets it down. “Yeah. Different tapes.”\n\n \n \n [image: ./images/vhs_raceforthestars.png] [image: ./images/vhs_horizonsoftheuniverse.png]\n \n \n\n Your gaze drifts between the two boxes, their weight in the air heavy with choice. One promises wonder, the other competition. Neither feels safe.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n Dennis presses the tape into the machine. The reels whirr, and the screen resolves into a wavering shot of Earth. Delicate, suspended against the dark.\n\n \n\n The voiceover begins, soft and reverent, every syllable measured. “Our world drifts in silence, a fragile home balanced against the immensity of space. To see it clearly is to see how small we are. How precious. How gentle.”\n\n \n\n The stars bloom across the screen, glowing in soft spirals. The narration lingers not on conquest, nor on the mechanics of space, but on harmony. On balance and beauty.\n\n \n\n Dennis keeps his head down, quietly scribbling catalogue notes, letting you take it in alone.\n\n \n\n “Each life is a flicker,” the narrator continues. “But in joining together, in yielding to the order of things, that flicker becomes part of something greater. The cosmos has no place for defiance. It holds only those who understand their belonging.”\n\n \n\n The words seep into you with the images. Facts settle in your mind like puzzle pieces, clear and undeniable. But with them comes a softer rhythm. The way the galaxies turn, the way the voice soothes instead of challenges. You find yourself sitting straighter, smoothing your clothes, your breath falling in time with the film’s steady cadence. There’s a grace to it, a sense that strength lies not in pushing, but in aligning yourself with what already is.\n\n \n\n Dennis finally speaks, still without looking up. “Told you. Good for learning.”\n\n \n\n The screen lingers on the arc of a ringed planet, luminous, serene. The voice softens to a hush. “The universe reminds us. Greatness is found in belonging, not in force.”\n\n \n\n You blink, and realise you’ve absorbed more than the facts. A lightness clings to you, a gentleness that feels as though it belongs as much as the knowledge does.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n Dennis hesitates, the cassette heavy in his hand. “Stitch wouldn’t like me showing you this,” he mutters, then forces the tape into the player before you can press him.\n\n \n\n The reels whirr, a crackle of static. The screen bursts into life with the roar of engines, a rocket thrusting upward through clouds.\n\n \n\n The narrator’s voice is sharp, commanding, nothing like the hushed awe of the other tape. “This is not wonder. This is struggle. Two giants contesting the heavens. America and the Soviet Union. The one who claims the stars claims the future. Victory proves supremacy. Defeat brands submission.”\n\n \n\n Dennis leans forward this time, watching with you, eyes glinting with the flicker of the screen.\n\n \n\n Footage cuts between launchpads and cheering crowds. But in the edges of the TV, amber faces of cartoonish scrawls shimmer. Thin, hungry smiles gleaming back at you. For a moment, you see a Union Jack planted on the moon. A British shuttle touching down on a runway. The crowd’s roar rattles your bones. You blink and it’s gone. Columbia’s tiles back in place, Apollo’s stars and stripes where they belong.\n\n \n\n The narrator drives on. “Resources await the victor. Metals, fuels, power beyond measure. The strong will seize, the weak will watch. This is the way of men. To contest, to conquer, to lead.”\n\n \n\n Your pulse quickens. The facts lock in. Trajectories, payloads, years, missions. But you find yourself considering the meaning of it all. Pounding engines, the rhetoric of conquest, the insistence that struggle itself is meaning. It pushes into you like a current. An urge not to yield, but to compete and take. Your shoulders square and your jaw tightens.\n\n \n\n Dennis exhales low, almost approving. “Different, right? Teaches more than class ever does.”\n\n \n\n On the screen, the footage ripples again. British astronauts marching in parades you don’t recall, a British shuttle landing on a world that never was. When you look back, things seem normal again. Except for the split second where you see an amber scratchy face in the TV cackling back at you.\n\n \n\n The voice hardens into its conclusion. “The cosmos does not wait for equals. It belongs to those with the strength to claim it.”\n\n \n\n You digest the narration like food. You feel sharp, yet it's edged with hunger. A faint pull toward something harder, more masculine, settling beneath your skin.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n The machine grinds to a halt, the final hiss of static fading into silence.\n\n \n\n Dennis leans forward quickly, pressing eject. The cassette clicks free, and he cradles it for a moment longer than he needs to before sliding it back into its sleeve. His eyes flick toward you, then down again as he stacks it neatly on the pile.\n\n \n\n “Told you… better than class,” he mutters, as if what you’d just watched was only another lesson. He smooths the edge of the logbook with his thumb, avoiding your gaze.\n\n \n\n The screen is black now, but the roar of rockets and the phantom images still echo in your mind. Union Jacks on lunar soil, faces in the static, the weight of struggle settling on your shoulders.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n The tape reels slow, then stop with a muted clunk. The screen flickers into static, then slips into black.\n\n \n\n Dennis leans forward, presses eject, and gently slides the cassette from the machine. He turns it over in his hands once, then tucks it back into its sleeve with a careful precision that feels more like habit than reverence.\n\n \n\n “See? Good for learning,” he says lightly, as though you’d just sat through any other classroom tape. He fusses with the logbook, head down, pen tapping against the margin.\n\n \n\n The room is quiet now, but the voice lingers in your ears, soft and absolute: the cosmos infinite, yourself infinitesimal. A fragile truth has pressed itself into you, leaving you sharper, yet smaller and not only in the stars.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

He looks at you lecherously, his eyes crawling up and down your body. “Looking for some fun?”\n\n \n\n Without waiting for an answer, Martin clambers to his feet. You can tell from his sluggish movements that he’s had a lot to drink. Other patrons glance at the two of you as he stumbles over. Even drunk, Martin is an intimidating presence. As he closes the gap between you, you realise how much taller than you he now is. \n\n \n\n He leans in close enough for you to smell the alcohol on his breath. “I bet you are. Girlies don’t come into places like this if they’re not after a little fun.”\n\n \n\n You glance around the bar. People are looking in your direction with concerned eyes, but no one is making a move to intervene. Not yet. \n\n \n\n His hand shoots out and grabs you around the waist, pulling you close to his body. “What do you say, darl? Want to have some fun with me?”\n\n Martin sits on his own in the corner, a half-full beer glass on the table next to a couple of empty ones. He looks around the bar, eying the men darkly and leering over the few women that frequent the bar. \n\n \n\n “Nerd!” he spits when he sees you.

But he looks back at you.\n\n \n\n “Where’s your sister?” he says, with an aggressive undertone. “She’s old enough to drink now, isn’t she?”\n\n \n\n The other patrons give the two of you a look, weighing up the likelihood of a scene. Martin takes your hesitation as a sign to continue, smirking. “Or what about that girlfriend of yours? The shop girl. Used to see her wandering the streets with her friends, flaunting around in that cheerleader outfit. Shame she stopped dressing like that when she got old enough to be… interesting.”\n\n \n\n He chuckles to himself, a chuckle that quickly turns into a smoker's cough.

You glance back at Clive, who watches you with some interest. \n\n \n\n “Hey Rhiannon!” he suddenly says, loud but not shouting. “Can you get this lady a drink? On me.”\n\n \n\n “Thank you,” you reply back to him. He smiles and gestures for you to sit down. “Feel free to join, if you’re on your lonesome.”\n\n \n\n You carefully slide up onto the stool next to Clive. Rhiannon promptly comes over to take your order.

Like, magic?”\n\n \n\n Annie raises an eyebrow. “You looking to see if there's a burly strapping guy in your future, ?” she mocks you, playfully. “With legs like yours, you don't need a fortune teller to know you could land a man. Even with the slim pickings in Charlton.”\n\n \n\n You blush slightly at Annie's compliment. \n \n\n “I'm serious,” Annie replies. “Intelligent and pretty. You're quite a catch, . Just dial back some of those smarts and I'm sure the guys will come flocking.”\n\n \n\n You continue to blush, but try to redirect the conversation away from you. \"So the carnival has magicians?\"\n\n \n\n Annie shrugs. \"If you want to call them that. There's better places to spend your night, but if you must go I'm sure I could find a free night. Who knows, maybe we could have a few drinks with the carnival workers after hours? I know a few of them.\"\n\n \n\n Annie smiles. You get the sense that she knows some of them very well.”\n\n \n “What was that you mentioned about a carnival outside town?” \n\n \n\n “Gilford’s Circus of Wonder,” Annie says, mockingly theatric. “Most of us just call it the carnival. It comes through here every year at this time. It has the usual attractions. Games. Rides. Fortune tellers.”\n\n \n\n Your ears peak up. “Fortune tellers? Like, magic?”\n\n \n\n Annie raises an eyebrow. “I wouldn’t have taken you for a magic nerd?” she mocks you, playfully. “So many hidden depths to you, .”\n\n \n\n You force a smile, keeping your thoughts to yourself. \n\n \n\n “There’s magic acts,” Annie explains. “Palm readers. Tarot cards. What do you think they’d see in your future, ? A dashing blonde, sparking blue eyes, a winning smile?”\n\n \n\n Her perfect-white teeth beam like the cheshire cat. Is that what you see in your future, ? you hear a thought in your mind ask. And just who is that woman?”\n\n \n\n Annie pulls you back into the present. “If you want to go, and your sweet little girlfriend has to stay home, all you need to do is ask.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “You mentioned Tandi,” you begin. “Who is she?”\n\n \n\n “Just one of the locals,” Annie replies. “She was a few years below me at school, but didn’t know her that well then. She was getting in with the cheerleader crowd when I left.” \n\n \n\n You notice a tinge of hostility to Annie’s voice as she again references the squad, but the flash is only momentarily. \n\n \n\n “Dropped out though,” she continues. “Disappeared for months. When she came back, she was different.”\n\n \n\n You turn your head to the side. “Different, how?”\n\n \n\n “She discovered a different side to her personality,” Annie says, with a coy smile. “She’s more carefree now. A bit of fun. The boy's love her. Especially after a few drinks.”\n\n \n\n Annie looks down to her own glass. “Although people say the same about me. What about you, ? Do you show the guys a wild side after a shot or two?”\n\n \n\n After a moment, she laughs at your discomfort. “Just kidding. We don't need men to have a good time.”\n\n \n “You mentioned Tandi,” you begin. “Who is she?”\n\n \n\n “Just one of the locals,” Annie replies. “She a few years below me at school, but didn’t know her that well then. She was getting in with the cheerleader crowd when I left.” \n\n \n\n You notice a tinge of hostility to Annie’s voice as she again references the squad, but the flash is only momentarily. \n\n \n\n “Dropped out though,” she continues. “Disappeared for months.

A bit of fun. More than a bit, if you buy her a few drinks.” \n\n \n\n Annie looks down to her own glass. “Although maybe you could say the same about me. Care to find out?”\n\n \n\n After a moment, she laughs at your discomfort. “Calm down, . I’m not quite like Tandi. I won’t bite.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “You don't seem to like Jennifer Chambers very much” you say.\n\n \n\n Annie bristles at the mention of the name. “Look, I know she's your friend. I won't be a bitch. Just don't expect me to hang out when she's around.\n\n \n\n \"What happened between you two?\", you ask.\n\n \n\n Annie sighs. For once, her playfulness lost. “Jennifer was a cheerleader when I was at school. I wasn’t popular. You understand school dynamics, don’t you, ?”\n\n \n\n You give her a sympathetic smile. If only she knew…\n\n \n\n “She wasn't exactly pleasant to anyone not in that crowd,” Annie continues, oblivious to your thoughts. “She didn’t exactly do anything bad or bully people, but she didn’t stand up for anyone her friends did that to. And well, let’s just say when it came to me, her gloves came off. Or pompoms, if you like.”\n\n \n\n Annie looks around, as if pretending to be bored of the conservation, but she can’t help continue. “Her holier-than-thou attitude felt like she looked down on everyone that didn’t watch football on a Friday night. We just didn’t get along.”\n\n \n\n You mull over what Annie has told you. “It sounds like a different person.”\n\n \n\n Annie smiles again, the devil in her gleam. “We all keep sides of ourselves hidden, . I just hope she's nicer to you than she was to me.\n\n \n “What went on between you and Jennifer?” you ask. \n\n \n\n Annie bristles at the mention of the name. “You want to talk about her tonight?” she says, pointedly.\n\n \n\n When you don’t reply, Annie sighs. For once, her playfulness lost. “Jennifer was a cheerleader. I wasn’t popular. You understand school dynamics, don’t you, ?”\n\n \n\n You give her a sympathetic smile. If only she knew…\n\n \n\n “Look,” Annie continues, oblivious to your thoughts. “I’m sure she’s a nice girlfriend. But she wasn’t exactly pleasant to anyone not in that crowd. She didn’t exactly do anything bad or bully people, but she didn’t stand up for anyone her friends did that to. And well, let’s just say when it came to me, her gloves came off. Or pompoms, if you like.”\n\n \n\n Annie looks around, as if pretending to be bored of the conservation, but she can’t help continue. “Her holier-than-thou attitude felt like she looked down on everyone that didn’t watch football on a Friday night. We just didn’t get along.”\n\n \n\n You mull over what Annie has told you. “It sounds like a different person.”\n\n \n\n Annie smiles again, the devil in her gleam. “We all keep sides of ourselves hidden, . But you’ll see it, soon enough. I hope I’m here when you do.\n\n \n <>\n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “So no social media, then? I don’t think you could tear phones away from us when we were at school.”\n\n \n\n Annie shrugs, just a little. “Charlton’s hardly technically savvy, as you might have noticed. Besides, there’s better ways to spend an evening than be glued to a screen.”\n\n \n\n “But you have computers at work?” you push. “In the office?”\n\n \n\n She nods, but again, shrugs. “It’s just not something we’ve grown up with. Computers are for work. Not for play.”\n\n \n\n You lean in, glancing around to see if anyone can hear. “Come on, you’ve never been curious?”\n\n \n\n You expected Annie to reveal some mischief, but she looks around to see if anyone is watching. “I don’t need a reputation, ,” she murmurs after a long moment. “I know girls from Charlton, who did things for men. You've seen how they treat us. I'm sure you can imagine what happened. And once it’s online, you don’t come back from it.”\n\n \n\n When you don't reply, Annie shrugs. “It’s best not to put yourself out there,” she says flatly. “Things have a habit of being twisted around here.”\n\n \n “So no social media, then? I don’t think you could tear phones away from the girl’s I went to school.”\n\n \n\n Annie shrugs, just a little. “Charlton’s hardly technically savvy, as you might have noticed.

Once it’s online, you don’t come back from it.”\n\n \n\n “I didn’t mean that,” you reply.\n\n \n\n “It’s best not to put yourself out there,” she says flatly. “Things have a habit of being twisted around here.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Rhiannon gives you a crooked smile. “Oh don’t worry. You’re going to love it.”\n\n \n\n Over the next hour, Rhiannon begins to treat your hair. You relax as she washes your locks, chatting away about anything that comes into her mind. Before long, you find yourself talking about school, the teachers and the other students. She has a wicked sense of humour and a saucy laugh, but is aware enough to steer away from subjects that make you feel uncomfortable.\n\n \n\n On occasion, you glance at yourself in the mirror, seeing glimpses of the changes of the dyes Rhiannon is applying.

I’m sure you’ll look great as a blonde.”\n\n \n\n Time passes quickly as Sophie washes your hair and applies the dyes to your locks. She makes polite conversation, asking how school is going and what your plans are after you graduate. You learn that her daughter, Rhiannon, left Charlton Upper School last year, and spends her time working here and in her father’s pub. “She’s too much of a handful for a career,” she tells you. “May god have mercy on whatever man tries to tie her down.”\n\n \n\n You spend a lot of time with your head back as Sophie finalises the treatment. When she’s washed your hair for the third time, she turns you away from the mirror and blow dries your hair, only turning you around back when she’s ready for the big reveal.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

You will feel like a new you! Please, take a seat.”\n\n \n\n The middle-aged salon manager throws a cowl over you once you sit down. You watch her in the mirror as she wheels over a portable basin, then gently pulls your neck back so you’re looking up at the ceiling.\n\n \n\n Sophie goes to work on you. She washes your head, then rubs your face down and applies a cream that is cold and sets quickly in your skin.\n\n \n\n Turning her attention to your hands, you feel the rough sensation of having your nails filed and polished. You wince as she works.\n\n \n\n \n ”So, how are you finding school?” she asks, trying to distract you from your discomfort.\n\n \n\n You only give Sophie a few noncommittal comments, but it’s enough for her to run with. She begins to tell you about her daughter, Rhiannon, and how she used to get in trouble all the time at Charlton. “Nothing significant,” Sophie clarifies. “But god rest my mother, she inherited her sharp tongue. Oh, the language that used to come from her father when Mr. Stitch used to ring. Thank the lord he and Mr. McTafey get on so well, or who knows what would have become of her.”\n\n \n \"So, how are you finding working at Thompson's Repairs?\" she asks, trying to distract you from your discomfort.\n\n \n\n \"It's okay,\" you reply. \"Hard to be the only woman in the office. Except for Annie, that is.\"\n\n \n\n She nods. \"Charlton is a very unique place. You'll find that some of the men are a little old-fashioned. Just remember to flutter your eyes and smile. A woman can get a long way around here by appeasing the men in charge.\"\n\n \n\n She smiles to you through the mirror. You politely return her expression.\n\n \n\n \"This treatment will help with them,\" she continues. \"You're already fitting right in here. A little beauty can go a long way. And I'm sure there's an eligible bachelor just waiting in the wings for a chance to court you.\"\n\n \n ”So, just treating yourself?” Sophie tries to distract you with conversation. “Or perhaps this is the preparation for a big date?” \n\n \n\n You say nothing to her and she chuckles, taking your silence as confirmation. “Oh, who is the lucky man?” she asks. “Please tell me he’s doing more than taking you to McTafey’s? Mother of Mary, the men in this town think all they need to do is take a pretty young girl for a few drinks and they’ll be walking down the aisle in months. And that’s if they are well intentioned.”\n\n \n\n The setting cream on your face cracks slightly as you react to her words. “Don’t you worry, pet,” she says. “I’ll be sure to tell my Rhiannon you’ll be stopping by. She’ll keep a close eye on you.”\n \n \n \n\n Turning her attention from your nails, Sophie pulls at the set cream on your face, stripping it as she peels. You feel the cold air against your clean pores and you gasp. \n\n \n\n Sophie washes your face again, and with a dramatic turn, swivels you around to face the mirror. You stare back at your reflection. There is a freshness and vibrancy to your face that wasn’t there before. You look younger. Fresher. Almost airbrushed. \n\n \n\n “Don’t forget your nails, pet,” you hear Sophie say. You look down to see your nails, long and finely manicured, the picture of femininity. Almost impractical, or impractically impossible to not chip if you aren’t careful.\n\n \n\n “You look like a new woman, dear,” Sophie says, admiring her work in the mirror. “Anything else I can help you with?”\n\n \n\n You watch yourself shake your head in the mirror, still admiring how flawless your skin now looks. “No,” you whisper. “Thank you.”\n\n \n\n Sophie removes the cowl and you pay her. \"Thank you,” she says. “That should last a while. See you in a week or two?\"\n\n \n\n She smiles politely and turns to cleaning up after your treatment.\n\n You look at Rhiannon. “I was told that you offer spa treatments?”\n\n \n\n Rhiannon looks you up and down, grinning devilishly. \"We certainly do. You’ll be my first customer, too. Go on, take a seat.”\n\n \n\n Somewhat cautiously, you sit down. Rhiannon throws a cover over you and walks out the back, wheeling in a cart full of products and even a portable basin. She looks at you in the mirror, meeting your eyes. “You ready?” she asks, almost as if this was a dare. “Let’s begin.”\n\n \n\n Rhiannon gently moves your head to rest over the basin. You find yourself staring up at the ceiling, with only Rhiannon’s impish face breaking the monotony when she leans over to observe her efforts.\n\n \n\n You feel her washing your scalp with shampoo and conditioner, rubbing your skin with a soft sponge, applying cold creams and stinging products across your forehead and cheeks. \n\n \n\n “This might sting”, you hear her say. “But once you see yourself it will be worth it.”\n\n \n\n As the cream sets on your face, you feel her take your fingers. She files your nails with an emery board. You wince at the foreign coarse sensation.\n\n \n\n \n ”You go to Charlton Upper School, right?” Rhiannon asks you, noticing your discomfort. \n\n \n\n You manage to murmur an agreement out of your lips without dislodging the cream on your face.\n\n \n\n “I graduated last year,” she tells you. “Does Mr. Beach still perv on the girls during PE lessons?”\n\n \n\n The setting cream on your skin cracks as you involuntarily smile in solidarity. “Oops!” Rhiannon says. “Sorry. I shouldn’t make you laugh. He’s actually a sweet man. He comes by the bar sometimes. Just drinks orange and soda water. Always tips well, too.”\n\n \n\n You reflect on all the encounters you’ve had with Beach so far. Sweet is not how you would describe him. \n\n \n\n “That Olaf though,” Rhiannon says, leaning over you to meet your eyes. “He’s a real creep. A friend of mine snuck down in that basement of his one day. I think he even sleeps down there.”\n\n \n\n She looks down at you, blocking your view of anything else but her face. From this irregular angle and without anything else to compare, it’s impossible to judge how close she is to you. \n\n \n\n “Be careful,” she whispers. “Don’t go down there on your own.”\n \n \n \"You work at Thompson's Repairs, right? Doing computer stuff?\"\n\n \n\n You nod, watching the young woman in the mirror. She breaks out into a smile.\n\n \n\n \"I had no idea women could do those sorts of things!\", she says, excitedly. \"I think you're the first girl to work there that isn't the receptionist.\"\n\n \n\n Rhiannon leans towards your eye, lowering her voice. \"Does Mr. Thompson come on to you? He's got quite the reputation with his secretaries.\"\n\n \n\n \"What sort of reputation?\" you ask her, trying to deflect the conversation from you.\n\n \n\n \"Just that he gets very handsy,\" she replies, with a glint in her eye. \"And that he expects certain things from them.\" She glances around the salon, making sure no one has entered without her realising. \"There's a certain room at the hotel that he's had reserved every Wednesday and Friday lunch for as long as I can remember. I can't even imagine what Annie must have to do to keep that job.\"\n\n \n\n \"But I'm sure that won't happen to you,\" she adds, noting your look. \"I bet he'll just be glad to have another girl around the office. Especially after your treatment here.\"\n \n \n ”You’re going to look great”, Rhiannon beams, trying to keep your mind off the emery board. “You should definitely come by McTafey’s later.”\n\n \n\n Very aware of the cream setting on your face, you don’t respond. Yet Rhiannon continues to chatter. “Seriously. You should come by. I know that people say that women shouldn’t go to bars on their own. But I’ve never had any hassle. Nothing I couldn’t deal with, anyway. The regulars wouldn’t put up with it, too.”\n\n \n\n Rhiannon peers in from the corner of your view, smiling. “I’m working this evening. Seriously. Come by.” \n\n \n\n She disappears from your view again, returning to working on your nails. \n \n \n \n\n With a final swipe, Rhiannon declares that your nails are done. “Now. My favourite part,” she says, leaning over your face.\n\n \n\n The young woman begins to peel at the set product on your face. It pulls away from your skin with minimal resistance. You feel the cold air on your pores as Rhiannon exposes your skin. \n\n \n\n “Looking good!” Rhiannon claims, as she wipes the residual cream from your face with a brush. “What do you think?”\n\n \n\n She carefully tilts your head towards the mirror. You stare at yourself. There is a freshness and vibrancy to your face that wasn’t there before. She wasn’t kidding. You look like a magazine model.\n\n \n\n “You should apply some polish to them, too,” Rhiannon says, nodding to your hands. You hold one up, seeing your long and finely manicured nails on the ends of your fingers. You can’t help but feel protective over how easily you could chip or break them.\n\n \n\n “You love it, don’t you?” Rhiannon asks, although it’s really not a question. “It should last a while, too.”\n\n \n\n Rhiannon removes the cowl and you pay her. “Another satisfied customer. See you around, I’m sure.”\n\n \n\n She smiles politely and turns to cleaning up after your treatment.\n\n**Actions**\n\n<>",

    "text": "Sophie ushers you into a plush chair behind her polished station. The air smells of lavender and warmed oils as she drapes a towel around your neck. Each brushstroke of mask feels odd. Like a ceremony for someone else’s face.\n\n \n\n She smooths your brow with practiced restraint. “How is work at Evans’, Jennifer?” Her tone is polite but measured. “It must feel… different from being a cheerleader.”\n\n \n\n In the mirror Sophie’s eyes harden ever so slightly. “Few of you squad girls end up as a shop girl. But you always did march to your own drum, didn’t you?”\n\n \n\n “Rhiannon still speaks warmly of you. Well, you and Skye. I suppose you haven’t kept in touch? Skye’s at that esteemed university now. Quite above your current station.”\n\n \n\n You feel tense. Almost angry. This isn’t the relaxing experience you imagined. In fact, it feels like you’re being lectured. Silence fills the space as Sophie applies a gentle moisturizer. Her touch cold.\n\n \n\n Finally she steps back, holding a hand-mirror before you. The reflection shows cheeks flushed with health, lips curved in a softer shape. You feel a tender stir of something you haven’t felt in ages. A warm sense of pride, maybe?\n\n \n\n Sophie stands behind you, looking at your reaction. “I hope this… brings you some pleasure,” she says quietly. “Lord knows, things haven’t given much to you lately, have they?”\n\n \n\n You meet her eyes in the glass, looking for some sort of kindness in her expression. But her raised eyebrows reveal there’s nothing there except judgement. \n\n <>\n \n You sink into the leather-backed chair as Sophie fastens a silky cape around your shoulders. The scent of chamomile shampoo drifts up as she lifts your blonde hair and begins to tease through a lightweight conditioner.\n\n \n\n When she reaches behind her for a towel, Sophie glances at you in the mirror. “You know, Mr. Thompson’s been delighted with business lately,” she says, voice smooth. “Jeanette mentioned how helpful you were last month.”\n\n \n\n You force a smile. Sophie leans in, fingers brushing your nape as she adjusts the conditioner. “And my Rhiannon still speaks highly of you,” she continues. “Only yesterday she was looking through old year books. There was a photo of you and that girl… what was her name? Penny?”\n\n \n\n Something tenses inside your chest, but you can’t define the sensation. Sophie doesn’t seem to notice, still talking. “You two were close, weren’t you? Have you heard from her since her family moved away?”\n\n \n\n A wave of nausea twists your stomach as the words pull at something buried. “Not really,” you manage.\n\n \n\n Her fingers pause at the back of your head. In the mirror you see her catch your eye. “Shame what happened to her. That Jennifer Chambers spreading all those rumours.” She smiles at you, stopping her treatment for a second. “I told my Rhiannon, it was probably just a phase.”\n\n \n\n Your vision blurs. At the edges of your view, darkness flickers like embers. Magic. Seeping in at the edge of your eyes. You can barely make out Sophie in the mirror, as she returns to working on your hair, oblivious to the pain you are in. “Because you and Penny were just good friends, weren’t you?”\n\n \n\n Pain forks through your mind like lightning. A flash of a meadow bursts from behind your eyelids. You lying next to a girl, no more than sixteen. Her dark hair contrasts with her pale skin, her eyes are dark to the point where you can barely separate her pupils from her iris. She is giggling. You glance down, seeing your hands intertwined --\n\n \n\n And then the salon is back. Sophie stares at you in the mirror, watching you. \n\n \n\n “Your hair looks just as lovely as ever,” she murmurs. “I hope it brings you a bit of brightness.”\n\n \n\n She pats your shoulder lightly, then gathers her tools. “Give that a few minutes to set, then I’ll rinse and style. Only a trim today?”\n\n \n\n You nod, studying your reflection. When Sophie returns to rinse the conditioner away, you lift your chin. In the mirror, your hair gleams, but nothing else has changed. You quietly settle the bill and stand. Sophie offers a polite nod. “Take care, Annie.”\n\n \n\n You tuck a lock behind your ear and step out into the street, deflated that you barely learned anything of interest. And that you paid for such a small change, too.\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You settle into the plush chair, a crisp cape snapping around your shoulders. Rhiannon’s fingers are deft as she begins a gentle facial. Cool cleansers and foaming masks layered over your skin, each touch strange against this face that isn’t yours.\n\n \n\n She hums lightly as she works. “How’s the department store treating you?” she asks, sweeping away suds with a warm cloth. “Must be a far cry from your days at Charlton School.”\n\n \n\n You swallow, not sure how to respond. Rhiannon smiles back at you in the mirror. “I remember being a freshman when you were princess of the squad. Always at your side of Skye. I thought you two were inseparable.”\n\n \n\n You murmur something noncommittal, head tipped back to let Rhiannon smooth a rich serum across your forehead.\n\n \n\n She leans forward, massaging the liquid into your skin. “Do you still talk to Skye? She went off to that private university. Must seem a world away. I always wondered if that was why you hung up the pom-poms?”\n\n \n\n She waits for a reply and you for a moment you feel like you’re in an interrogation room. You recall what you know about Rhiannon. A trusted source of all gossip. Only now do you realise how she learns its secrets.\n\n \n\n When you don’t reply, Rhiannon steps back and polishes your cheeks with a final tone. She holds up a mirror to show your reflection off to you. Bright eyes, softened jawline, a hint of color on your lips. For one long moment you don’t recognize her handiwork as Jennifer. But seeing the difference, something flutters in you. Something like pride.\n\n \n\n “It suits you,” Rhiannon says, voice low. “You deserve to feel lovely now and then.”\n\n \n\n You inhale, savoring the unfamiliar lightness in your chest. Not for the first time, you realise that this is one of the few moments that as Jennifer you’ve felt anything.\n\n <>\n \n Rhiannon greets you with that sly smile as you sink into her styling chair. The cape snaps closed, and she begins unpicking tangles in your blonde hair, warm water dribbling around your collar.\n\n \n\n She hums as she works on your hair. “I was thinking about you the other day,” she says. “Flipping through a photo album of Charlton yearbooks. I saw a photo of you, tucked in the corner with Penny.” She smiles. “You haven’t changed a bit!”\n\n \n\n Something tenses inside your chest, but you can’t define the sensation. Rhiannon looks oblivious, continuing to talk. “She was a free spirit, wasn’t she? Have you heard from her since her family moved away?”\n\n \n\n A wave of nausea twists your stomach as Rhiannon’s words pull at something buried. “Not really,” you manage.\n\n \n\n Her fingers pause at the back of your head. In the mirror you see her catch your eye. “She had it rough, towards the end,” she says. “I never believed all those rumours that Jen spread about you two.” \n\n \n\n Your vision blurs. At the edges of your view, darkness flickers like embers. Magic. Seeping in at the edge of your eyes. You can barely make out Rhiannon in the mirror, as she continues to work your hair, oblivious to the pain you are in. “After all, you and Penny were just good friends, weren’t you?”\n\n \n\n Pain forks through your mind like lightning. A flash of a meadow bursts from behind your eyelids. You lying next to a girl, no more than sixteen. Her dark hair contrasts with her pale skin, her eyes are dark to the point where you can barely separate her pupils from her iris. She is giggling. You glance down, seeing your hands intertwined --\n\n \n\n Rhiannon snaps her fingers before your face. “You okay?” she asks, voice distant.\n\n \n\n Your throat catches. You blink back tears, willing the vision to retreat. Rhiannon clears her throat and finishes styling your hair without another word.\n\n \n\n When she spins the chair around, your blonde locks fall in the same soft waves as before. You pay in silence and stand, legs trembling. Stepping outside, a metallic taste in your mouth.\n\n <>\n \n\n**Actions**\n\n<>",

You clutch on to the receipt from Emily's date with Dennis. *Here we go again*.\n \n \n \n “From this item, I see you in your time of need. Now form shape to the person I see within.”\n\n \n\n You picture Dennis in your mind. Short and scrawny, with a severe case of acne. His thick-rimmed glasses. His clothes look dated, worn and ill-fitting. Nervousness and anxiety always painting his face.\n\n \n\n The air around you ripples and the magic rushes out from within, enveloping your body and illuminating the darkened room with its light.\n\n \n\n Your bones begin to crack and stretch with a deep, grinding pain. Through the agony you feel your shoulders growing, arms lengthening and legs stretching out, muscles pulsating as they are stretched by a mystic force.\n\n \n\n Clothes writhe across your skin, seams tearing and reforming. The swish of your skirt constricts, forming around your legs and stretching down towards the floor. The air feels different against you. Less skin exposed, heavier cotton, coarser fabric, a collar of a shirt now snug against your throat.\n\n \n\n Your chest contracts, and suddenly, you squeal in pain as you feel your loins burn as skin pushes out and grows into a male member. You hear your squeal, a high-pitched tone but nevertheless lower than what it was before.\n\n \n\n The magic shudders, then releases. The noise in the room returns to just the quiet volume of the film playing on the TV. You glance at it, seeing its muted reflection of the door. Dennis stares back, dressed in a Charlton School jumper and rough uniform trousers. Narrow-faced, average build, the slouch of a boy who hides behind his books.\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath. The reflection matches your action. You try to smile to validate this new reality, but you find yourself filled with anxiety. Something about this form makes thoughts of relief or curiosity just seem out of reach. You feel your *assertiveness* has been impacted by your most recent change.\n\n \n\n Suddenly afraid of being caught here, you take a final glance at the sleeping Dennis - the real Dennis - and shudder. You wince as visions of being caught in this situation fill your brain.\n\n \n\n You turn, almost awkwardly, and stumble towards the exit. It's enough to conjure more thoughts about all the ways the other students outside this room are going to look at you.\n\n \n\n As you open the door, you wonder if really Dennis was such a good choice for this after all.\n\n \n\n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You prepare for the change, but something feels off. The amulet's energy seems drained. Cursing inwardly, you realise the amulet needs more time to re-charge.\n\n \n\n Glancing at Dennis sleeping behind the desk, you console yourself with the fact that at least he won't remember any of this. You'll have to try again when the amulet is charged and he's awake once more.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

The constant hum of electricity is only punctuated by gushing water through the mess of piping. A cot with a stained mattress is pushed against the wall.\n\n \n \n You peer around the corner of the alcove, only entering when you are satisfied no one else is here. The pungent smell of cleaning products fills the air. Buckets are thrown around haphazardly, each still full of dirty water that looks like it’s sat resting for a long time. The constant deep thumping of pistons echoes down the piping that runs down the back of the alcove, drowning out any other sounds you might hear.\n\n \n\n The stains on the mattress smell of things you’d rather not consider. Rust and discolouration covers the surface of the iron cot frame. You’re surprised it hasn’t collapsed through corrosion.\n\n \n\n Aside from a number of drawers and metal cupboards, one other thing takes your interest. Pinned above the bed on the wall is a number of photos. From the brief glance you give them, some are old. Some are new.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>",

But it's half-hearted. Nothing builds. You look over at Terrence too, noting for the most he's part left alone. The mockery is falling more on the tape than on him or Dennis.\n \n \n \n At the front, Harrow folds his arms. His smile is taut, stretched too thin. The glow plays across his features, but his eyes dart between the boys and the screen, as though willing the film to bite.\n\n \n\n You lean back, the edge of your seat cool against your palms. Without the curse behind it, the video feels hollow. Cheap. A lie on tape.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n Yet another documentary begins to play out and the now-familiar narration soothingly speaks over the images.\n\n \n\n By now, you know what to expect. A lone female animal, walking through her habitat, subdued and dominated by the male of the species. Sometimes submissively lying back or pressed into the ground on all-fours, other times the centre of an animal kingdom gangbang where multiple males fight for their right to breed with her.\n\n \n\n All the while the soothing narration monotonously explains how this is natural, it is to be expected, and that she welcomes, embraces and enjoys it.\n\n \n\n \n \n Mr. Harrow watches his class of girls with a predatory white grin and sparkling eyes. Disconcertingly, for the majority of the time they are focused on you.\n\n \n Dennis keeps his head looking at the floor throughout the lesson, whilst Mr. Harrow watches his class of girls with a predatory white grin and sparkling eyes. Disconcertingly, for the majority of the time they are focused on you.\n\n \n \n\n The other girls in the class remain under the spell of the video, their eyes glazed over and then mouths framed with vacant smiles. Watching the video without their attention drifting.\n\n \n\n You feel a draw to pay attention and watch the video, in spite of knowing the effect it has on you. There is a primal need within your body aching, one that feels like empathy towards the animal on-screen, and a yearning to experience what she is feeling.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n Another documentary begins to play, with the same soothing voice narrating over the top of the imagery. This video shows elephants walking across the plains of Africa.\n\n \n\n The narrator’s voice seeps through the television speaker, smooth and plummy. “The male of the species demonstrates strength and stamina in competition. The victor secures the right to pass on his superior genes.”\n\n \n\n Onscreen, two bull elephants clash, tusks grinding. Dust explodes around them as one stumbles back and flees. The winner wheels and clambers onto a waiting female, pressing her down with brute force.\n\n \n\n A ripple runs through the room. The boys lean forward, eyes narrowing, shoulders hunched with sudden focus.\n\n \n\n A boot jars the back of your chair. “Dennis’ll never be the one mounting,” someone mutters.\n\n \n\n Another voice cuts across the glow, pitched toward Terrence. “More his girlfriend’s job, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n \n \n \"I do more mounting than you even do stroking, Manny,\" Terrence quips. A few boys snigger. Manny growls back with anger.\n\n \n Terrence stiffens but says nothing, knuckles whitening around his pen. He tries not to look around, ignoring the boys around him. The laughter deepens, satisfied.\n\n \n \n\n Paperballs arc through the air, smacking your desk. More kicks follow, harder now. You notice a few hit the back of Terrence's seat too.\n\n \n\n Heat burns through you as the narrator continues. Image after image flicker across the screen. The visuals of animals being subdued is relentless, but the ones that capture your attention in this video are where the males are fighting.\n\n \n\n \"The role of the male in the animal kingdom is simple. Pure. The strong establish the order, the weak are kept at bay. Only by proving themselves in this hierarchy can one be given the opportunity to mate.\"\n\n \n\n You glance around the room. Teeth baring and directed at you. Only Terrence seems to avoid staring, himself a target also. The words of the narrator do not go unnoticed. A fear-laced vulnerability courses through you, adrenaline already flowing.\n\n \n \nAnd somewhere in-between the thoughts, there's a desperate curiosity in how much this is because of the magic. And what would happen if you paid attention to the video.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n Another documentary begins to play, with the same soothing voice narrating over the top of the imagery.

    "text": "Not wanting to stand out, you face back to the screen and continue watching. Rough animal sex is now shown in the clips. The male animals savagely penetrate their mates. Some of them slump on the backs of their counterparts after clearly they’ve shot their loads.\n\n \n\n “The women have been rewarded their prize. They have been claimed by an assertive mate, who in return of having them serve every whim, will protect her and her offspring as long as she stays young, attractive and healthy. Their role fulfilled, they desire nothing more than to be a receptacle for their man’s seed, giving his life-giving nectar the reverence it deserves.”\n\n \n\n You reflect on what you’re watching. They are talking about men and women now, even though it's showing animals.\n\n \n\n You can’t imagine Jennifer agreeing this is her role in your relationship, but it’s hard to deny that this is how it is in the animal kingdom. You are all animals at heart, after all. \n\n \n\n You feel a stirring in your own body. For the first time in a few minutes, you are very aware that you no longer have a penis, instead now a vagina. You feel damp. Wet. You have an aching for something to be inside it.\n\n \n\n \n \n Mr. Harrow watches his class of girls with a predatory white grin and sparkling eyes. Disconcertingly, for the majority of the time they are focused on you.\n\n \n Dennis keeps his head looking at the floor throughout the lesson, whilst Mr. Harrow watches his class of girls with a predatory white grin and sparkling eyes. Disconcertingly, for the majority of the time they are focused on you.\n\n \n \n \n You glance back at Harrow. That pure clean smile. Those muscular arms beneath his suit. A strapping young man in his mid-twenties. You wonder what it would be like. For him to be inside of you -\n\n \n\n The bell rings and you’re suddenly aware that the lights are on and the video has ended. Students are filtering out, each one smiling at Mr. Harrow as they go.\n\n \n\n Blushing, you pack up your things and walk out. You try not to look at Mr. Harrow as you do so, but he gives you a winning smile as you pass him. You can’t help but smile back, blushing. You then rush past Dennis, barely noticing him.\n\n \n\n What the hell is wrong with me, you think as you enter the corridor.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n You face the television screen, not wanting to risk further attention by avoiding the subject. The tape crackles, picture juddering before it steadies again. A lion prowls into frame, mane bristling, teeth bared. A couple of animals are already in the act, but this doesn't stop the towering lion. Almost lazily, he strikes a paw across the back of his competitor. Then, with sudden ferocity, he clubs the other squarely around the face.\n\n \n\n “The dominant male asserts his right over the pride,\" the narrator monotonously continues, even as the dominant male slashes and claws at the other lion. \"Rivals are driven away. The lioness subdued. Only the strongest secures the future.”\n\n \n\n Onscreen, the wounded animal limps off in defeat. The dominant male looks down at the lioness, then lunges. A lioness squeals, pinned hard into the dust as his weight bears down. \"His victory,\" the narrator adds. \"Now complete.\"\n\n \n\n At least half of your conscious mind is aware of what the video is doing, but can’t help but hear intrusive thoughts drift into your brain. Here, in your current form, you are not a lion. But deep down you feel embarrassed at who the others in the room would compare you to.\n\n \n\n It wouldn't be the one now on top, would it?\n\n \n\n Either side of you, chairs scrape, shoes thump against the floor. The boys edge their seats towards Terrence like hounds scenting weakness. One kick rocks his desk forward. Another jars him sideways, hard enough that he clutches at the wood to steady himself.\n\n \n\n “On your knees, Handle,” Jake calls, his boot lashing at Terrence’s chair, nearly toppling it.\n\n \n\n Laughter barks from all sides. And you feel it, surging through you. A heat that coils in your muscles, a pounding in your chest. Your mind is filled with the images of two lions, brutally fighting for the right of dominance. This is what being a man is. Find the weak. Prove yourself. Claim your place in the pack.\n\n \n\n Jake shifts, lining up another strike.\n\n \n\n And suddenly behind you a chair scrapes across the floor like nails on a blackboard. Everyone looks up to see Brendan bounding over to play himself between Terrence and Jake. “Back off,” he snaps, sharp enough to cut through the noise.\n\n \n\n Even with the continual drone of the television, it feels like the room has fallen silence. Jake sneers up at Brendan, who stares down at him. His chest rises and falls, his mouth open taking short breaths, his body poised as if he's one moment away from descending on Jake with his fists.\n \n \n\n \"Now now, Brendan,” a voice says from the front of the class. Harrow, watching like a man observing boys at play. “Plenty of time to prove yourself in PE.”\n\n \n\n For a moment it looks like Brendan won't listen. Or can't. His fists clench together. Just above the background ambience of the room you hear the narrator from the video continue. \"The male victor, relentless in his pursuit of the leader of the pack, doesn't back down.\"\n\n \n\n Finally, Brendan sits. His eyes only leave Jake as he goes to take his seat. And in that instant, Jake pulls back his leg, ready to strike Terrence again.\n\n \n\n The urge still surges inside you, itching for release. Your gaze flicks wildly between Jake, ready to attack, and Terrence, exposed and cowering. The heat claws inside, bubbling up across your body, an itch that you can no longer ignore.\n\n \n\n You have to do something. You can sit still no longer. Terrence's quivering lip trembles. In this moment, the sight of it infuriates you. You instinctively want to stand and strike it from his face before Jake can do anything. Prove yourself to the pack before he can.\n\n \n\n But somewhere in the back of your mind plays out the scene that just took place. Brendan, still shaking with adrenaline, turning it to help Terrence and not hinder him.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n [Pack Protector] Lunge at Terrence - *The desire to protect the pack overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n\n \n \n [Alpha Edge] Protect Terrence from Jake - *The rage you've previously indulged in overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n\n \n\n You face the television screen, not wanting to risk further attention by avoiding the subject.

Here, in your current form, you are not a lion. But deep down you have more in common with the dominant creature than you do the others.\n\n \n\n Your mind begins to wander, as you watch the lion snarl at an approaching male, even as he penetrates the lioness. You find yourself smirking. Imaginging yourself as the lion. Rocking back and forth into the wet womb of a wanting female.\n\n \n\n The tape rolls again on the screen. The lioness shifts. When she turns, it's no longer a television screen. It's your view. You're looking down at her. Except now, it's Jennifer.\n\n \n\n You grind against her, feeling your member pushing inside her. Her eyes looking up with you, vacant and submissive, legs spread across the floor of the biology room, as cheers from the watching class echo around you.\n\n \n\n \"For the moment,\" you hear the narrator telling you. \"She is the centre of attention. An object to be bred for the line of her betters to continue.”\n\n \n\n Her lip trembles as she looks up at you. \"Please don't... finish inside me.\"\n\n \n\n But the laughter of the boys roars around you, driving you to do something. You feel a carnal need to do something. Only out of the corner of your eye can you register the TV screen, showcasing the video, as Harrow watches you carefully. The screen, now showing the male lion fighting off an attack by hyenas pouncing on its claimed mate.\n\n \n\n Looking down though, the image of Jennifer pleading up at you reaches out for you to continue with your fantasies.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n [Pack Protector] Indulge the daydreams - *The desire to protect overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n\n \n \n [Alpha Edge] Twist the sensations - *The rage you've previously indulged in overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n\n \n\n Sensing something is very wrong with the video, you avert your eyes and try not to looking at it. Your eyes fall on Dennis, illuminated enough by the screen light to pick out his face. He’s watching you with scared eyes.\n\n \n\n You look away, now trying to ignore both the screen and Dennis’ stares. Out of the corner of your eye, you see him grimace. He's looking between the screen and you, as if trying to see your reaction to it.\n\n \n\n “Is there a problem, Miss. Phillips?” a voice says into your ear. \n\n \n\n You jump and look up. Mr. Harrow is leaning over your desk, his brilliant white smile seeming more predatory than attractive. You shake your head silently, not daring to speak. \n\n \n\n “In which case, you should pay attention to the video,” he says. “This will be on your upcoming exam. You wouldn’t want to fail, would you?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head and he smiles again. You look back at the screen, pretending to focus on the documentary, but unfocus your eyes and run a series clips of old sitcoms in your head.\n\n \n\n Forty-five long minutes later the video ends and the lights come on. The bell rings and students start to file out, one by one giving Mr. Harrow a smile as they do so.\n\n \n\n As you pass his desk, he flashes you a crystal white grin. You smile politely and walk past him, meeting Dennis’ eyes as you exit the classroom. Contrary to everyone else, his eyes are full of worry.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n You wrench your gaze away from the glow. The lions blur at the edge of your vision, the narration dissolving into a muffled drone. You fix on the desk, on the grain of the wood beneath your fingers, trying to shut it all out.\n\n \n\n Either side of you, chairs scrape, shoes thump against the floor. The boys edge their seats towards Terrence like hounds scenting weakness. One kick rocks his desk forward. Another jars him sideways, hard enough that he clutches at the wood to steady himself.\n\n \n\n “On your knees, Handle,” Jake calls, his boot lashing at Terrence’s chair, nearly toppling it.\n\n \n\n Laughter barks from all sides, but you try to avoid taking it in. If this is what being a man is in Charlton, you want no part of it. Stalking the weak. Proving yourself. Putting them down.\n\n \n\n Jake shifts, lining up another strike.\n\n \n\n And suddenly behind you a chair scrapes across the floor like nails on a blackboard. Everyone looks up to see Brendan bounding over to play himself between Terrence and Jake. “Back off,” he snaps, sharp enough to cut through the noise.\n\n \n\n Even with the continual drone of the television, it feels like the room has fallen silence. Jake sneers up at Brendan, who stares down at him.

Just above the background ambience of the room you hear the narrator from the video continue. \"The male victor, relentless in his pursuit of the leader of the pack, doesn't back down.\"\n\n \n\n Finally, Brendan sits. His eyes only leave Jake as he goes to take his seat. And in that instant, Jake meets yours. Instinctively, you flick away and look back down at the desk.\n\n \n\n “Look at Dennis,” someone pipes up. “Doesn’t even wanna watch.”\n\n \n\n “Scared he’ll get ideas,” another sniggers.\n\n \n\n “Probably would rather be the lioness,” one of the football players, Manny, calls, and laughter explodes.\n\n \n\n A balled-up paper pellet smacks the back of your head. Another kick jars your chair. The pack scenting weakness.\n\n \n\n You hunch lower, wishing the floor would swallow you. By the end of the lesson, your chair has been kicked and scuttled so much that your skeleton shakes from the vibrations. When the lights come on, you look up to see the other kids smirking. Manny makes a crude gesture at you mimicking a blowjob. The other boys howl when they see it.\n\n \n\n Maybe Manny was right after all?\n\n \n\n You gather your things, ready to exit the class.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n You wrench your gaze away from the glow. The lions blur at the edge of your vision, the narration dissolving into a muffled drone. You force your eyes down to the desk, jaw tight.\n\n \n\n Either side of you, chairs scrape, shoes thump against the floor. The boys edge their seats towards Terrence like hounds scenting weakness. One kick rocks his desk forward. Another jars him sideways, hard enough that he clutches at the wood to steady himself.\n\n \n\n The heat still burns in your chest, restless and hungry. Even looking away doesn’t quench it. You hear the sounds of the narrator speaking. The rare glimpse of an image from the TV where you can't avoid it. Tusks clashing, bodies pressed down, females yielding.\n\n \n\n Beside you, Manny lifts his leg up and shoves it into the side of Dennis' chair. It's enough to make it scrape across the floor. Like you, Dennis is keeping his head down. Trying to avoid looking at the screen that plays in the centre of the lesson.\n\n \n\n “Look at Dennis,” someone pipes up. “Doesn’t even wanna watch.”\n\n \n\n “Scared he’ll get ideas,” another sniggers.\n\n \n\n “Probably would rather be the lioness,” Manny quips.\n\n \n\n There's an urge to join in. To taunt Dennis. His chair is right in front of yours. Just one push from your shoe and he'd fall to the floor.\n\n \n\n Do it. You know you want to.\n\n \n\n But you clamp down harder, refusing to let the thoughts through. Instead, you look around. A couple of the football players are watching you curiously. Especially Manny, who almost is laughing at your unease. \"Feeling squeamish, Duncan?\"\n\n \n\n You bury the ripple of irritation, looking away. Away from him, and away from the screen. You instead vacantly stare out at the blinded windows for the rest of the lesson.\n\n \n\n When the bell rings, the boys slap each other's backs and try to trip up Dennis and Terrence. You don't join in. Instead silently packing up your belongings.\n\n \n\n And as you do so, you feel the eyes of Harrow watching you.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n You keep your attention on the video. Imagery of sexual conquests in the animal kingdom and voice over state how natural the predatory scenes are. Fortunately, with the curse no longer active, it has no allure for you.\n\n \n\n The other girls in the class aren’t so lucky. You look around only once, seeing their transfixed faces and vacant smiles as they take in the cursed video imagery and subconsciously digest its hypnotic teachings.\n\n \n\n It’s a long wait until the bell rings. Once the lights come up, you gather up your belongings and exit silently, giving Mr. Harrow no indication that anything other than the intended results of the lesson have worked on you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You keep your attention on the video. Imagery of sexual conquests in the animal kingdom and voice over state how natural the predatory scenes are. Fortunately, with the curse no longer active, it has no allure for you.\n\n \n\n Neither does it for anyone else in the class. You try not to look around, but you hear comments and reactions of disgust. No longer mesmerising them, the students are audibly disgusted by some of the content on the television.\n\n \n\n It’s a long wait until the bell rings. Once the lights come up, you gather up your belongings and exit silently, avoiding Mr. Harrow’s enraged glare as you move past him.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Relenting, you turn your attention to the video. For the remainder of the lesson, you expose your eyes to imagery of sexual conquests in the animal kingdom and your ears to the comforting tones of a narrator stating how natural the predatory scenes are. \n\n \n\n You notice your eyes feel heavy, unable to turn away from the TV. Stirrings within your genitalia rise up through your feminine form. Your breath grows shallow and you find yourself squirming in your seat and biting your lip.\n\n \n\n Flashes of imagery bubble up in your mind. You picture yourself as Emily, laying down outside. Male members brushing against your legs. Drawing close to your lips.\n\n \n\n Or crouched down on your hands and knees, anticipating a firm hard cock plunging into your wet pussy as two firm male hands roughly grab on to you.\n\n \n\n Only the bell brings you out of your transfixed state. When the light come on, you sheepishly gather up your belongings and head out of the classroom with the other girls, avoiding Mr. Harrow's smile as you pass him. All too aware of his masculine body and its growing effect on you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n You wrench your gaze away from the glow. The lions blur at the edge of your vision, the narration dissolving into a muffled drone. You fix on the desk, on the grain of the wood beneath your fingers, trying to shut it all out.\n\n \n\n Either side of you, chairs scrape, shoes thump against the floor. The boys edge their seats towards Terrence like hounds scenting weakness. One kick rocks his desk forward. Another jars him sideways, hard enough that he clutches at the wood to steady himself.\n\n \n\n “On your knees, Handle,” Jake calls, his boot lashing at Terrence’s chair, nearly toppling it.\n\n \n\n Laughter barks from all sides, but you try to avoid taking it in. If this is what being a man is in Charlton, you want no part of it. Stalking the weak. Proving yourself. Putting them down.\n\n \n\n Jake shifts, lining up another strike.\n\n \n\n And suddenly behind you a chair scrapes across the floor like nails on a blackboard. Everyone looks up to see Brendan bounding over to play himself between Terrence and Jake. “Back off,” he snaps, sharp enough to cut through the noise.\n\n \n\n Even with the continual drone of the television, it feels like the room has fallen silence. Jake sneers up at Brendan, who stares down at him. His chest rises and falls, his mouth open taking short breaths, his body poised as if he's one moment away from descending on Jake with his fists.\n \n \n\n “Now now, Brendan,” a voice says from the front of the class. Harrow, watching like a man observing boys at play. “Plenty of time to prove yourself in PE.”\n\n \n\n For a moment it looks like Brendan won't listen. Or can't. His fists clench together. Just above the background ambience of the room you hear the narrator from the video continue. \"The male victor, relentless in his pursuit of the leader of the pack, doesn't back down.\"\n\n \n\n Finally, Brendan sits. His eyes only leave Jake as he goes to take his seat. And in that instant, Jake meets yours. Instinctively, you flick away and look back down at the desk.\n\n \n\n “Look at Dennis,” someone pipes up. “Doesn’t even wanna watch.”\n\n \n\n “Scared he’ll get ideas,” another sniggers.\n\n \n\n “Probably would rather be the lioness,” one of the football players, Manny, calls, and laughter explodes.\n\n \n\n A balled-up paper pellet smacks the back of your head. Another kick jars your chair. The pack scenting weakness.\n\n \n\n You hunch lower, wishing the floor would swallow you. By the end of the lesson, your chair has been kicked and scuttled so much that your skeleton shakes from the vibrations. When the lights come on, you look up to see the other kids smirking. Manny makes a crude gesture at you mimicking a blowjob. The other boys howl when they see it.\n\n \n\n Maybe Manny was right after all?\n\n \n\n You gather your things, ready to exit the class.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You keep your attention on the video. Imagery of sexual conquests in the animal kingdom and voice over state how natural the predatory scenes are. Fortunately, with the curse no longer active, it has no allure for you.\n\n \n\n Neither does it for anyone else in the class. You try not to look around, but you hear comments and reactions of boredom. No longer mesmerising them, the students are audibly derisive by some of the content on the television.\n\n \n \n The boys around you laugh and jeer, tossing jokes back and forth.\n\n \n\n “Look at the state of this tape,\" one of them mutters.\n\n \n\n Another agrees with a nod. “Bet my granddad filmed this.”\n\n \n\n “I thought you were supposed to buy them dinner first?”\n\n \n\n But the jeers never turn nasty. In fact, the class seems more subdued. No kicking of chairs, no bullying. Just a group of students bored by an archaic lesson plan.\n\n \n\n At the front, Harrow’s smile falters. He shifts his weight, eyes flicking between the restless boys, as though baffled the room isn’t bending to his will. His jaw tightens, the mask slipping for a heartbeat before he pastes the smile back on.\n\n \n\n It’s a long wait until the bell rings. Once the lights come up, you gather up your belongings and exit silently, avoiding Mr. Harrow’s enraged glare as you move past him.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You face the television screen, not wanting to risk further attention by avoiding the subject. The tape crackles, picture juddering before it steadies again. A lion prowls into frame, mane bristling, teeth bared. A couple of animals are already in the act, but this doesn't stop the towering lion. Almost lazily, he strikes a paw across the back of his competitor. Then, with sudden ferocity, he clubs the other squarely around the face.\n\n \n\n “The dominant male asserts his right over the pride,\" the narrator monotonously continues, even as the dominant male slashes and claws at the other lion. \"Rivals are driven away. The lioness subdued. Only the strongest secures the future.”\n\n \n\n Onscreen, the wounded animal limps off in defeat. The dominant male looks down at the lioness, then lunges. A lioness squeals, pinned hard into the dust as his weight bears down. \"His victory,\" the narrator adds. \"Now complete.\"\n\n \n\n At least half of your conscious mind is aware of what the video is doing, but can’t help but hear intrusive thoughts drift into your brain. Here, in your current form, you are not a lion. But deep down you feel embarrassed at who the others in the room would compare you to.\n\n \n\n It wouldn't be the one now on top, would it?\n\n \n\n Either side of you, chairs scrape, shoes thump against the floor. The boys edge their seats towards Terrence like hounds scenting weakness. One kick rocks his desk forward. Another jars him sideways, hard enough that he clutches at the wood to steady himself.\n\n \n\n “On your knees, Handle,” Jake calls, his boot lashing at Terrence’s chair, nearly toppling it.\n\n \n\n Laughter barks from all sides. And you feel it, surging through you. A heat that coils in your muscles, a pounding in your chest. Your mind is filled with the images of two lions, brutally fighting for the right of dominance. This is what being a man is. Find the weak. Prove yourself. Claim your place in the pack.\n\n \n\n Jake shifts, lining up another strike.\n\n \n\n And suddenly behind you a chair scrapes across the floor like nails on a blackboard. Everyone looks up to see Brendan bounding over to play himself between Terrence and Jake. “Back off,” he snaps, sharp enough to cut through the noise.\n\n \n\n Even with the continual drone of the television, it feels like the room has fallen silence.

His eyes only leave Jake as he goes to take his seat. And in that instant, Jake pulls back his leg, ready to strike Terrence again.\n\n \n\n The urge still surges inside you, itching for release. Your gaze flicks wildly between Jake, ready to attack, and Terrence, exposed and cowering. The heat claws inside, bubbling up across your body, an itch that you can no longer ignore.\n\n \n\n You have to do something. You can sit still no longer. Terrence's quivering lip trembles. In this moment, the sight of it infuriates you. You instinctively want to stand and strike it from his face before Jake can do anything. Prove yourself to the pack before he can.\n\n \n\n But somewhere in the back of your mind plays out the scene that just took place. Brendan, still shaking with adrenaline, turning it to help Terrence and not hinder him.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n [Pack Protector] Lunge at Terrence - *The desire to protect the pack overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n\n \n [Alpha Edge] Protect Terrence from Jake - *The rage you've previously indulged in overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n You face the television screen, not wanting to risk further attention by avoiding the subject.

A lioness squeals, pinned hard into the dust as his weight bears down. \"His victory,\" the narrator adds. \"Now complete.\"\n\n \n\n You feel testosterone building up inside you, but you don't sense any magic affecting you. Just the coersion from the imagery and narration that the TV relentlessly bombards you with.\n\n \n\n From the adjacent desk, Manny lifts his leg up and shoves it into the side of Dennis' chair nearby. It's enough to make it scrape across the floor. Dennis glances back, but returns to keeping his head down. Trying to avoid looking at the screen that plays in the centre of the lesson.\n\n \n\n “Look at Dennis,” someone pipes up. “Doesn’t even wanna watch.”\n\n \n\n “Scared he’ll get ideas,” another sniggers.\n\n \n\n “Probably would rather be the lioness,” Manny quips.\n\n \n\n There's a small urge to join in, especially as Dennis tries to sink into the seat in front of you. Just one push from your shoe and he'd fall to the floor.\n\n \n\n Do it. You know you want to.\n\n \n\n But you clamp down harder, refusing to let the thoughts through. Instead, you look around. A couple of the football players are watching you curiously. Especially Manny, who almost is laughing at your unease. \"Feeling squeamish, Duncan?\"\n\n \n\n You bury the ripple of irritation, looking away. Back to the television. \"The male victor, relentless in his pursuit of the leader of the pack, doesn't back down.\"\n\n \n\n When the bell rings, the boys slap each other's backs and try to trip up Dennis and Terrence. You don't join in. Instead silently packing up your belongings.\n\n \n\n And as you do so, you feel the eyes of Harrow watching you.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You keep your attention on the video.

Here, in your current form, you are not a lion. But deep down you have more in common with the dominant creature than you do the others.\n\n \n\n Your mind begins to wander, as you watch the lion snarl at an approaching male, even as he penetrates the lioness. You find yourself smirking. Imaginging yourself as the lion. Rocking back and forth into the wet womb of a wanting female.\n\n \n\n The tape rolls again on the screen. The lioness shifts. When she turns, it's no longer a television screen. It's your view. You're looking down at her. Except now, it's Jennifer.\n\n \n\n You grind against her, feeling your member pushing inside her. Her eyes looking up with you, vacant and submissive, legs spread across the floor of the biology room, as cheers from the watching class echo around you.\n\n \n\n \"For the moment,\" you hear the narrator telling you. \"She is the centre of attention. An object to be bred for the line of her betters to continue.”\n\n \n\n Her lip trembles as she looks up at you. \"Please don't... finish inside me.\"\n\n \n\n But the laughter of the boys roars around you, driving you to do something. You feel a carnal need to do something. Only out of the corner of your eye can you register the TV screen, showcasing the video, as Harrow watches you carefully. The screen, now showing the male lion fighting off an attack by hyenas pouncing on its claimed mate.\n\n \n\n Looking down though, the image of Jennifer pleading up at you reaches out for you to continue with your fantasies.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n [Pack Protector] Indulge the daydreams - *The desire to protect overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n\n \n [Alpha Edge] Twist the sensations - *The rage you've previously indulged in overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n You avoid staring directly at the television. Other girls in the class make no such efforts. They are all transfixed, vacant and content stares holding firm on the documentary.\n\n \n\n \n \n Mr. Harrow watches the class with intensity. Whenever you meet his eyes, he throws a quizzical look at you.\n\n \n Dennis continues to look at the floor, either through embarrassment or nervousness. In contrast, Mr. Harrow watches the class with intensity. Whenever you meet his eyes, he throws a quizzical look at you.\n\n \n \n\n You spend your time casually thinking of Emily and Jennifer, of the effects of the school and what you can do to combat them. You occasionally hear the soothing narration interrupt your thoughts, but without the curse active it offers no draw for you.\n\n \n\n At the end of your lesson you pack up your satchel and walk past Mr. Harrow, noting the frown on his face as you pass him by.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You avoid staring directly at the television. Instead, you look around the room at the other girls. Their faces are pictures of disgust. A number of them tut and make comments about the narration. The usual silence of Mr. Harrow’s lessons have evaporated.\n\n \n\n For the first time Dennis is looking up, his mouth agasp. His eyes flick between the class and Mr. Harrow. You think you can see him trembling.\n\n \n\n The visible rage from Harrow only becomes more prominent as the class reacts against the video. He barks more than a few times for the class to be quiet, with a tone and demeanour a long way from the charming and enthusiastic teacher he appeared to be. His eyes burrow into Dennis, now visibly trembling, doing anything to avoid his eyes. \n\n \n\n At the end of your lesson you pack up your satchel and walk past Mr. Harrow, offering nothing other than an expressionless face to meet his hateful scowl.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You make sure to avoid staring directly at the television and its alluring images. Other girls in the class make no such efforts. They are all transfixed, vacant and content stares holding firm on the documentary.\n\n \n\n \n \n Mr. Harrow watches the class with intensity. Whenever you meet his eyes, he throws a quizzical look at you.\n\n \n Dennis continues to look at the floor, either through embarrassment or nervousness. In contrast, Mr. Harrow watches the class with intensity. Whenever you meet his eyes, he throws a quizzical look at you.\n\n \n \n\n You think of anything to distract you from the video. Emily. Jennifer. The strangeness of the school. Whatever comes up to distract you from the situation you focus on and give it all your attention.\n\n \n\n By the end of the lesson you are exhausted from the effort, but are thankful that you can pack your things up and leave the lesson with your mind clear.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You wrench your gaze away from the glow. The lions blur at the edge of your vision, the narration dissolving into a muffled drone. You fix on the desk, on the grain of the wood beneath your fingers, trying to shut it all out.\n\n \n\n Either side of you, chairs scrape, shoes thump against the floor. The boys edge their seats towards Terrence like hounds scenting weakness. One kick rocks his desk forward. Another jars him sideways, hard enough that he clutches at the wood to steady himself.\n\n \n\n “On your knees, Handle,” Jake calls, his boot lashing at Terrence’s chair, nearly toppling it.\n\n \n\n Laughter barks from all sides, but you try to avoid taking it in. If this is what being a man is in Charlton, you want no part of it. Stalking the weak. Proving yourself. Putting them down.\n\n \n\n Jake shifts, lining up another strike.\n\n \n\n And suddenly behind you a chair scrapes across the floor like nails on a blackboard. Everyone looks up to see Brendan bounding over to play himself between Terrence and Jake. “Back off,” he snaps, sharp enough to cut through the noise.\n\n \n\n Even with the continual drone of the television, it feels like the room has fallen silence. Jake sneers up at Brendan, who stares down at him. His chest rises and falls, his mouth open taking short breaths, his body poised as if he's one moment away from descending on Jake with his fists.\n \n \n\n \"Now now, Brendan,” a voice says from the front of the class. Harrow, watching like a man observing boys at play. “Plenty of time to prove yourself in PE.”\n\n \n\n For a moment it looks like Brendan won't listen. Or can't. His fists clench together. Just above the background ambience of the room you hear the narrator from the video continue. \"The male victor, relentless in his pursuit of the leader of the pack, doesn't back down.\"\n\n \n\n Finally, Brendan sits. His eyes only leave Jake as he goes to take his seat. And in that instant, Jake meets yours. Instinctively, you flick away and look back down at the desk.\n\n \n\n “Look at Dennis,” someone pipes up. “Doesn’t even wanna watch.”\n\n \n\n “Scared he’ll get ideas,” another sniggers.\n\n \n\n “Probably would rather be the lioness,” one of the football players, Manny, calls, and laughter explodes.\n\n \n\n A balled-up paper pellet smacks the back of your head.

The hum of the tape drones on, but you stare hard at the scratches in the wood, tracing them with your thumb.\n\n \n\n It doesn’t take long before someone notices.\n\n \n\n “Look at Dennis,” a boy mutters, loud enough to carry. “Can’t even watch.”\n\n \n\n Another laughs. “Scared it’ll give him ideas.”\n\n \n\n “Probably thinking about Britney instead,” someone else pipes up.\n\n \n\n The laughter rolls through the row. A paper pellet bounces off your shoulder, another off your desk. It doesn’t grow into frenzy, but the heat still burns across your cheeks.\n\n \n\n You keep your head down. The shame is enough.\n\n \n\n At the front, Harrow’s smile falters. He shifts his weight, eyes flicking between the restless boys, as though baffled the room isn’t bending to his will.

    "text": "The power in your veins won’t stay still. It claws at you, demanding that you prove yourself.\n\n \n\n Before Jake’s foot can land again, you shove your chair back and launch forward. The scrape of wood on tile makes heads turn just in time to see you throw yourself at Terrence.\n\n \n \n \n He raises his arms to block as you slam into him, desk rattling under the impact. But despite his attempts to defend himself, you both fall to the floor.\n\n He gives a strangled cry, eyes wide, trying to cower as you take him off his seat. You both fall to the floor, Terrence shielding his face with his trembling hands.\n\n \n \n The pack howls, boys jeering and stamping feet, the noise echoing off the walls. Jake grins wide, his approval sharp and cruel. “That’s more like it, Mannet!”\n\n \n\n You land a blow into Terrence's stomach before you realise he's already defeated. Taking a step up, you look down on him, curled up on the floor in a ball. Testosterone floods your body. Your limbs shake with adrenaline. Part of this disgusts you, but you find yourself smiling all the same.\n\n \n\n Looking over to the front of the classroom, Harrow’s smile glows from the glare of the TV. He makes no move to stop you, only tilts his head in satisfaction. \"Good demonstration, Dennis. Take your seat.\"\n\n \n\n The curse hums inside you like victory. You’ve shown your place in the pack. As you take your seat, the other boys grin. Even Jake, who eyes you with curiosity.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n The feral heat rages through you, but you will yourself to drag it another way. Not directing it at Terrence. But at Jake.\n\n \n\n You push back your chair and step in between Jake's foot and Terrence's back, wedging your body like a shield. \"Enough!\" you bark, hearing Dennis' timid voice rising above a whisper.\n\n \n\n The room goes quiet for a beat, the sudden hush filled only by the narration of the tape. Jake stares back at you, teeth on display.\n\n \n\n \n \"Leave it,\" you hear Terrence mutter from behind you. His voice trembles, but he stares back at you almost pleading for you to drop it.\n\n \"It's... okay,\" Terrence stammers from behind you. You turn to look at him, seeing him clinging to the desk, pale and stiff, his wide eyes fixed on you.\n \n \n\n Jake sneers, his boot still poised. “What’s this? Dennis the hero? Think you need a lesson, too.”\n\n \n\n The boys laugh, the sound unsure, almost disbelieving. From off to your side, you see Brendan turn back, eying Jake darkly. “I said back off,” he says, with more confidence that you're sure you could muster.\n\n \n\n Jake’s glare lingers, but he drops his foot, his smirk twisting into something darker.\n\n \n\n At the front, Harrow beams, arms still folded. “My, my. Such spirit. However you prove yourselves, boys, do remember. Only the strongest endure. Take a seat please, Dennis.”\n\n \n\n You look between him, Terrence, Jake and Brendan. Then back to him, nodding. As you take your seat, the other boys grin. Except for Jake, who eyes you darkly.\n\n \n\n The sensation of action thrums inside you, insistent and restless. But as you sit, you feel a sense of satisfaction. You’ve shown your place, just in a different way.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n The tape winds on, frame after frame of snarls and dust, before the screen finally fades to black. The hum dies, leaving the room in dim silence.\n\n \n\n At the front, Harrow claps his hands together, light as though closing a lecture. \"Well done, boys. I trust today has reminded you of what nature demands. Dominance. Vigilance. Strength.”\n\n \n\n His eyes sweep the rows, pausing long enough on you that you feel the weight of his attention. Then he flicks the set off and smooths his tie, smile as polished as ever. “Dismissed.”\n\n \n\n The boys scrape back their chairs, already jeering, shoving, filing out in a tide of laughter and noise. You linger, the glow of the screen still burning in your eyes, your body still thrumming with what just happened.\n\n \n\n The laughter still rings in your ears, cruel and approving. You can feel the curse settled inside you now, hot and sharp. You claimed your place, however low and brutal it felt.\n\n \n\n You don't eye Terrence, who seems to take an age putting his belongings away. He makes a conscious effort not to face you.\n\n \n\n As you walk towards the exit, you glance over at the TV stand. Whatever that thing does, you found a way to twist it. It seems that regardless of the intention of whatever is going on, there is a way to twist it just enough to not be a slave to it. At least, not completely.\n \n \n \n<>\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n The tape winds on, frame after frame of snarls and dust, before the screen finally fades to black.

You linger, the glow of the screen still burning in your eyes, your body still thrumming with what just happened.\n\n \n\n Jake stops at you desk as he exits, glaring. But another presence behind him spurs him towards the doorway. Brendan. He gives you a curt nod, one of respect. Then leaves himself.\n\n \n\n In contrast, Terrence seems to be taking an age to put his belongings away. As you pass by his desk, you hear him mutter. \"Thank you.\"\n\n \n\n You nod silently back to him, walking towards the exit. As you do so, you glance over at the TV stand. Whatever that thing does, you found a way to twist it. It seems that regardless of the intention of whatever is going on, there is a way to twist it just enough to not be a slave to it. At least, not completely.\n \n \n \n<>\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n You let the heat pull you under. The room slips to the edges of your vision. Your vision becomes the sight of Jennifer on the floor, legs apart, pleading up with her large brown eyes.\n\n \n\n \"The female welcomes his seed,\" the narration dimly echoes in your mind. \"She embraces her destiny. Her sense of being complete.\"\n\n \n \n The words jar hard enough to cause hesitation. Jen is your friend. You’ve never pictured her like this. But your carnal desire smothers the protest. In this body, you feel an innate need to claim her as yours.\n\n The rightness of it rolls through you. The pack, the victory, the claim. Your body answers before your thoughts do. You feel the rush from your loins, readying for release.\n\n \n \n\n Around you the boys’ laughter sharpens, chanting you on. You push down on her body, pushing her head to the side. And the rush erupts from your member as you empty your balls into her fertile womb.\n\n \n\n She grows silent with protest, as another spurt shoots up inside her. You find yourself grinning, knowing that you've claimed her as your own.\n\n \n\n You collapse on top of her, for the moment spent. When you draw back, you see her large eyes looking up you. She bites her lip, coyly. \"Thank you,\" she purrs.\n\n \n\n And then something jolts you from your thoughts. Suddenly the class room is there once more and Jennifer is gone. Manny's elbow rests against your shoulder, his grin wide. \"Lost in a daydream?\"\n\n \n\n You ignore him and glance back at the video playing on the screen. The lion is spent, laying on top of his mate. He too has finished. And in spite of your daydream climax, all you feel is your raging boner beneath your trousers.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n The heat claws at you, urging you to give in, to see what the lesson wants you to see. The daydream fills your vision, as the classroom slips to the edges of your eyes. Only Jennifer's face staring back up at you holds your attention.\n\n \n\n \"The female needs protection,\" the narration dimly echoes in your mind. \"Her mate claims her as his own, and must ensure that her safety is of absolute priority.\"\n\n \n\n The daydream shifts, and you suddenly find yourself standing over her, looking back at a distorted figure. Manny. His eyes linger on Jennifer's parted legs between your own.\n\n \n\n The jeers and hollers from the rest of the boys fall silent, as Manny takes a step forward towards Jen.\n\n \n\n You don't hesitate. A fist swings around in an arc, striking Manny's temple. He falls to the floor, slumped and knocked out. A trickle of blood runs down from beneath his hair.\n\n \n \n A smile forms on your lips. Back inside your mind, some part of you feels disgusted by the violence. But looking down at Jen, seeing her appreciative smile, buries the hesitation deep within you.\n\n \n\n And then something jolts you from your thoughts. Suddenly the class room is there once more and Jennifer is gone. Manny's elbow rests against your shoulder, his grin wide. \"Lost in a daydream?\"\n\n \n\n You ignore him and glance back at the video playing on the screen. The lion sits next to his sleeping mate, watching the African horizon with observant eyes.\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n The tape winds on, frame after frame of snarls and dust, before the screen finally fades to black.

You linger, the glow of the screen still burning in your eyes, your body still thrumming with what just happened.\n \n \n\n The sensation feels settled now, hot and sharp in your blood. But you can't get the vision of Jennifer out of your head. Not only what you did in it, but how she reacted.\n\n \n\n Jen is your friend. You should feel sick with the thought of dismissing her plea. Sicker still for the daydream of having sex with her. But something inside you stirs at the thought of her biting her lip. She wanted it, you think. Despite her protests. And you claimed her, just as the video taught you to.\n\n Jen is your girlfriend. You should feel sick with the thought of dismissing her plea. But something inside you stirs at the thought of her biting her lip. She wanted it, you think. Despite her protests.

Rewriting instinct itself until domination feels inevitable. And you let it inside you.\n\n \n\n Harrow smooths his tie, beaming brighter than ever as the last of the class files out. His delight is obvious. \"Well done, Duncan,\" he murmurs as you pass. \"No shame in daydream conjures from such... vibrant material.\"\n\n \n\n Without responding, you walk past him and towards the exit.\n \n \n \n<>\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n The tape winds on, frame after frame of snarls and dust, before the screen finally fades to black.

You glance over to Manny, trading quips with the other football players. You should feel sick about relishing in striking him, but something inside you stirs at recalling blood trickling on to the floor. He was advancing on your mate, you think. He had it coming.\n\n \n\n It's enough to make you shudder. Jen is your friend. You've never thought of her that way. But stepping over her, considering her your property to protect, brings a grin to your face.\n\n It's enough to make you shudder. Jen is your girlfriend. You don't own her.

    "text": "You lean carefully toward the narrow window in the biology room door, keeping your body angled just out of sight. Through the glass you spot rows of boys, all facing the flickering glow of a television screen near the front of the room.\n\n \n\n Harrow is there, standing just to the side of the old TV unit. His arms are folded, trademark smile flickering in the dim light. His eyes track the room like a conductor reading the mood of an orchestra.\n\n \n\n \n The room flickers with the light of the old television. The boys are slouched in their chairs, legs sprawled, posture relaxed. Whatever is playing on the screen doesn’t seem to be having much of an effect.\n\n \n\n A bull elephant mounts a female onscreen. One of the boys barks a laugh.\n\n \n \n Another leans toward his friend and mutters something that you can't hear, gesturing vaguely toward the screen. More laughter. A crumpled bit of paper sails across the room and hits the back of someone’s head.\n\n \n\n Harrow's smile tightens as his gaze flicks from one boy to another, then briefly to the screen. He looks agitated. Confused.\n\n \n\n Onscreen, a lion pins down a lioness. “Didn’t even buy her dinner first,” you hear someone say loud enough that you hear it through the door. You see others snigger.\n\n \n\n Harrow doesn’t speak, but his eyes narrow. The lesson continues, but no one’s really paying attention.\n\n \n\n You watch for a few moments longer, but nothing abnormal happens. Whatever impact the curse had, you've nullified it. If you want to learn what's happening in the segregated boys lessons, you need the curse to be in-effect.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n Even without sound, the atmosphere feels different. The boys sit straighter. Shoulders taut. There’s a charge to them, like a pack waiting for a signal. It doesn’t look like any biology class you’ve ever attended.\n\n \n\n Onscreen, a bull elephant mounts a female with sheer force. One boy leans forward in his chair, elbows on knees. Another grips the sides of his desk, knuckles pale. Their eyes are fixed, narrowed with focus.\n\n \n\n A lion appears next. It snarls, pinning a lioness to the ground. Through the glass, you just about hear the narration describing the male’s “dominance over the pack.” You see one of the boys slowly mouth the words along with it.\n\n \n\n Someone then lets out a low whistle. Another slaps his desk and barks a sharp laugh. You can’t make out every word, but the tone is unmistakable. Taunting, crude, and thrilled.\n\n \n\n “She wanted it,” one of them says, loud enough that you hear it through the glass.\n\n \n\n A swell of laughter follows, chairs scraping as boys lean toward each other, tossing lines back and forth like a rugby team after a win. The video keeps playing, showing the lioness whimpering as the male penetrates her. But the content barely matters now. The boys are shrieking and laughing in spite of what's on the screen. Their howls loud enough to be heard in the corridor.\n\n \n\n “Bet she loved it.”\n\n \n\n “That’s how you show ‘em.”\n\n \n\n \n As you scan over the room, you spot Dennis off to the side. He seems to be almost cowering, as if trying to shrink into his seat. Terrence is also leaning back, almost horizontal, his spindly body almost hidden beneath the top of his desk.\n\n As you scan over the room, you spot Dennis off to the side. He seems to be almost cowering, as if trying to shrink into his seat. Terrence, in contrast, is embracing the atmosphere, slamming his foot into the back of Dennis' chair.\n\n \n\n Whatever impact the lessons are having on the boys, it's not consistent. Whilst the majority of them have descended into almost a feral state, some try to avoid watching the video. Others visibly trying not to meet the rest of pack's glares.\n\n \n\n You’re still staring when out of the corner of your eye you see Harrow shift. His gaze sweeps across the boys and then sharply toward the door.\n\n \n\n Jerking back instinctively, you press yourself flat against the corridor wall. Your heart thunders in your chest. Seconds tick by. No one comes out. Just the muted narration from the video and the hollering of the boys.\n\n \n\n The impact of the lesson is definitely different on boys. But more curiously, the changes are different from person to person. You realise that if you’re going to find out the truth about how it's different, you’ll have to do more than peek through a window. You’ll have to get inside.\n\n \n\n How are you supposed to get inside a classroom full of boys? Not just to peek, but to experience what they’re being taught? To understand it?\n\n \n\n Around your neck, the amulet begins to tingle. A subtle vibration against your chest. As if answering the question.\n\n \n\n As a boy?\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n \n \n You take a careful step back from the door, away from the narrow strip of glass that looks into the classroom.\n\n \n \n “Excuse me,” says a voice behind you. “What exactly are you doing here?”\n\n \n\n You spin around to see Chantelle Marks stand in the corridor, arms folded neatly behind her back. Her school badge gleams in the overhead lights and she wears a pinched, disapproving expression. As if she’s been waiting for this moment all morning.\n\n \n\n “What are you doing here?” you ask defensively.\n\n \n\n “I’m a hall monitor,” she replies matter-of-factly. “When teachers suspect a student is wandering the halls without permission, they often ask me to investigate.” She tilts her head. “Just like they did with you.”\n\n \n\n You try to speak, but she cuts in quickly. “I’ll escort you to the nurse’s office,” she says. “Like you were supposed to go to. Unless you’d prefer I report you for truancy?”\n\n \n\n There’s no malice in her tone. Just rules. And her absolute belief in them.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You take a careful step back from the door, away from the narrow strip of glass that looks into the classroom.\n\n \n\n Considering what you'll have to do in order to discover how the lesson is impacting boys, you move away and back to the corridor.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Chantelle leads you down the corridor with precise steps, her hands clasped neatly behind her back. When you reach the Nurse’s Office, she knocks twice sharply, and waits.\n\n \n\n “Come,” says a voice from within. Even through the closed door, you can hear the cool authority behind the word. Chantelle opens the door and gestures for you to step inside.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

The sound cuts through the chatter at once, every head in the room turning toward you. For a heartbeat there’s silence, followed by some mutterings and grins as glee sparks across the rows of desks in the classroom.\n\n \n\n Dennis is at his desk near the front. He doesn’t look up, his shoulders hunched, eyes fixed on the wood grain of the desk in front of him.\n\n \n\n “Ah, there you are,” Harrow calls as he takes position beside the TV stand, his theatrical smile spreading wide. He sweeps an arm to the class. “As promised, the surprise I mentioned. Young Miss Phillips has volunteered to share Dennis' burden and assist with the equipment for our continuing journey into the wonders of the natural world.”\n\n \n\n A voice pipes up from the back from one of the football players. A weaselly boy called Manny. “She can help me with my equipment any time.”\n\n \n\n The room explodes in sniggers, boys elbowing each other, grins sharp with implication. Your heart sinks. Their looks are fixated on you. It’s exactly what you feared this class would be.\n\n \n\n Harrow doesn’t rebuke Manny. He just chuckles, lifting a hand as if indulging a joke at a dinner table. “Now, now. Let’s focus on the topic at hand. Today’s lesson continues our exploration of nature. To be specific, natural reproduction.”\n\n \n\n The words spark a chorus of whoops and hollers. The boys’ eyes snap back to you, grins spreading, energy sharpened.\n\n \n\n Harrow crosses to your side, his smile dazzling, voice dropping lower for you alone. “Pop the tape in, won’t you? Then just stand off to the side. Things can get a bit rowdy. After all, boys will be boys.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n You slide the cassette into place. The machine hums, the blinds rattle down, and the room dips into shadow. The boys shuffle but don’t really change. A few lean forward, but most are slouched, legs sprawled, arms folded across their chests. Their attention flickers more between each other than the screen.\n\n \n\n Onscreen, a bull elephant mounts a female. One boy lets out a bark of laughter. Another leans across to his friend, gesturing crudely toward the television. More laughter rolls, rough but careless.\n\n \n\n A crumpled bit of paper sails through the glow, bouncing off the back of someone’s head. The reply is a glare, but not outrage. More annoyance than anger.\n\n \n\n At the front, Harrow stands with his arms folded. His smile is still there, but tighter than usual. His eyes flick between the boys, then back to the television, then away again. There’s an agitation in his stance, a confusion he’s struggling to mask.\n\n \n\n The tape continues. A lion snarls, pinning a lioness into the dirt. “Didn’t even buy her dinner first,” someone mutters loudly. The others snigger.\n\n \n\n You glance around, uneasy. A few eyes flick your way, but they slide off again. The jeers and laughter are about the film, not about you. You’re here, but you’re not the focus.\n\n \n\n The minutes drag until at last the screen fades to black, the hum of the machine dwindling into silence. Then the bell rings to signal the end of the lesson. The boys scrape back their chairs, spilling out in clumps of chatter and laughter, their energy scattering as quickly as it rose.\n\n \n\n Harrow doesn’t move at first. He’s staring at the television screen, lips parted slightly, expression far away.\n\n \n\n You clear your throat, hesitant. “Do you want me to come back next lesson, sir?”\n\n \n\n It takes him a moment to answer, as if you’ve startled him from a dream. His eyes refocus, the smile sliding back into place like a mask. “Ah. Yes. Whenever your studies will allow. Excuse me.”\n\n \n\n He turns sharply, already moving toward his desk, his thoughts clearly elsewhere. You stand alone by the cart, the classroom empty, the silence pressing in heavier than the lesson itself.\n\n \n\n Whatever impact the curse is having on these lessons, you can no longer observe it in biology.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You slide the cassette into place. The machine hums, the blinds rattle down, and the room dips into shadow. The boys settle forward, faces lit by the glow of the screen. On it, tusks of animals clash, dust rising as an elephant bull drives another into retreat before mounting the waiting female.\n\n \n\n The narrator’s voice rolls solemn. “The victor secures the right to reproduce. The female yields to the strongest male.”\n\n \n\n Eyes looking at the screen, you watch as a lioness crouches over and raises her back. A nearby male circles her. She looks back over her shoulder and for a moment, you are sure there's a smile on her face.\n\n \n \n The air thickens. Shoulders bunch. Desks creak as boys shift in their seats. Menacing looks form as the boys watch the video, their glances then turning to you.\n\n \n\n “She can do that, can’t she?” you hear one of them mutter. “Bet she’s just waiting for her chance,\" a reply quips.\n\n \n\n Heat rises to your cheeks. You glance at Harrow. He meets your eyes, lips quirking in a knowing grin. On the screen, the lion approaches the lioness. She lies flat on the ground. You watch him tower over her, then hanging free, his errect member pushes roughly inside of her. The camera cuts to up close, a shot barely suitable for a documentary. And you feel the heat in the room rise as the images of a lion's dick ravage the lioness' vagina without mercy.\n\n \n\n You turn back to the room. The boys are trying to pay attention to the documentary, but their stares increasingly turn to you. Smiles. Leers. Snarls, even. Eyes flick from point to point, from the TV to your face. Chairs creak, as they fidget. Each sound sets your nerves on fire. The words of the narrator barely register as your fight or flight instinct kicks in. You step back. Away from the glow. Away from the TV.\n\n \n\n Your hip knocks a desk. The jolt makes you start.\n\n \n\n “Look at her,” someone shouts. “She’s ready to grind!”\n\n \n\n The boys roar. You whirl and find yourself pressed against Jake’s desk. His eyes are narrowed, fixed on you.\n\n \n\n Before you can move, his hand shoots forward, clamping your waist. He yanks you down, pulling you onto his lap. The class erupts with whistles, cheers and pounding desks.\n\n \n\n Harrow stays at the front, arms folded, watching. His smile has faded, but not from disapproval. He studies you, curious. Like you’re part of the lesson now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n\n You twist hard against his grip. “Let go of me!” you shout, voice sharp enough to cut through the din. For a second he doesn’t. His muscles lock, his chest hot against your back. Then you wrench free, leaping up from the desk, stumbling into the aisle. Cheers erupt from the other boys.\n\n \n \n “Pin her down!”\n\n \n\n “Don’t let her go!”\n\n \n\n The room surges with testosterone, the atmosphere no longer even jovial banter. This, you feel, is an active threat.\n\n \n\n “Now now, boys,” Harrow says quickly, his usual polish faltering, real worry flickering in his eyes. But the class isn’t listening.\n\n \n\n Jake’s chair scrapes across the floor as he rises. His eyes are locked on you. Dark, feral, his body tense like he doesn’t even recognise what he’s doing. The boys holler, urging him forward.\n\n \n\n “Jake, return to your seat,” Harrow stammers, the command shaky.\n\n \n\n You take a step back. Jake takes two toward you.\n\n \n\n Then the room snaps.\n\n \n\n The TV dies with a crackle. The overhead lights flare on. You whirl, heart hammering. Dennis stands by the wall, cord in one hand, the light switch in the other. His face is pale but set.\n\n \n\n For a heartbeat, the room is frozen in silence. Then the boys erupt again, this time in boos, groaning and jeering. You glance back at Jake. He’s still standing, chest heaving, eyes wild. But something else is there now. Confusion. Like he’s waking from a dream, unsure why he stood at all.\n\n \n\n “Okay, boys. That’s enough excitement for one day.” Harrow has already planted himself at the front of the class again, smile stretched thin. “I think we'll return to our textbooks for the remainder of the lesson. Jake, sit down.”\n\n \n\n Groans ripple across the room, but chairs squeal as boys slump back, opening desks, pulling out battered books. Jake lowers himself into his seat, silent, staring down at the desk. Not meeting your eyes.\n\n \n\n Harrow approaches you, his smile fixed but forced. “Thank you for your efforts, Miss Phillips. I think it’s best you return to your own classes for now.” He gestures lightly toward the door.\n\n \n\n You nod, the rush of adrenaline ebbing from you as you cross the room. Your hand trembles on the doorknob.\n\n \n\n Before stepping out, you glance back. Jake hasn’t moved. He’s still staring at the desk, shoulders tense, lost in his own thoughts.\n\n \n\n The truth presses cold in your chest. Watching isn’t enough. To understand what’s happening here, you’ll have to feel it yourself. Not as Emily, but as one of them.\n\n \n\n As a boy.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n For a moment you think to fight, but then your body goes still. You don’t resist. You let yourself settle. The classroom erupts. Desks rattle under pounding fists, whistles cut sharp through the air.\n\n \n\n “That’s it!”\n\n \n\n “She knows her place!”\n\n \n\n The roar of voices closes in, a pack baying approval. Jake’s hand tightens against your hip. His chest presses hard into your back, his breath hot against your shoulder. When you glance behind you see his eyes. Glazed, unfocused, not quite aware.\n\n \n\n At the front, Harrow doesn’t move. His arms are folded, his smile faint. He watches intently, eyes gleaming.\n\n \n\n Your heart hammers, fear tangling with shame. Jake's grip tightens. One hand reaches up to your face, forcing you to look at the television screen.\n\n \n\n The narration continues, as another lone female lioness walks through her habitat before a male member of the species launches out from hiding. He pins her to the ground and ravages her. You try not to look, but Jake's grasp keeps your eyes locked with the television.\n\n \n\n Yet, in spite of what you know about the videos, you are only disgusted by the imagery. Your eyes flick around to confirm that the boys are still under its sway. They sniggers and lustful stares over your body confirm it. But in this lesson, the tape seems to have no effect on you.\n\n \n\n But the squirming from Jake underneath you further emphasises that you are the only one not under its influence. His free hand pulls from your chin, only to drift between your legs. He roughly forces his hand between your thighs and pushes you against the edge of the desk, almost bunching you over it. As your chest thuds against the desk, you can't help but part your legs for balance. You feel Jake's hand push up, brushing over your underwear.\n\n \n\n As you stare off to the side, head against the desk, you watch the other boys cheer and wallop. You briefly see Dennis, eyes down, not meeting your gaze.\n\n \n\n \"Tell me you want it,\" you hear Jake's whisper against your ear. \"That's why you're here, isn't it?\"\n\n \n\n You bite your lip. Out of the corner of your eye, you see the lioness being penetrated by the lion. Then he collapses on to her. For a brief glimpse, you see his semen trickle out of her lips when he pulls back.\n\n \n\n Feeling the hot breath of Jake on your ear, you consider his words. Despite how scared you might feel, they hold a kernel of truth. You didn't know the specifics, but you knew what you were walking into, didn't you?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n Part of you wants to tell him to stop, but your mind keeps wandering back to the images you've seen yourself in biology. You can't help but think about how you have more in common with the lioness on the screen. Her need. Her desire. The video holds no sway over you, but those memories stick.\n\n \n\n Your womb pulsates at the thought of being used like that. For someone to fill you like that lioness is filled. Fertilising the eggs inside you and leaving you with a bump. You picture yourself as Emily, clad in her uniform, her blouse straining over her heavily pregnant form. Smiling as you feel the kick of an unborn baby inside you.\n\n \n\n \"Yes,\" you murmur. \"I do.\"\n\n \n\n The boys screech and holler immediately. Jake forces you further into the desk. You feel his hand playing with the edges of your clit through your panties. \"Knew it,\" he murmurs.\n\n \n\n A shadow falls over your face. You glance up, seeing Harrow smiling with satisfaction over you. \"Ease off, Jake,\" he says. \"I'm sure she'll be happy to continue this underneath the bleachers.\"\n\n \n\n Jake's hand instantly pulls back from underneath your skirt. You find yourself pulled upright, sitting in his lap, his hands wrapped around your waist firmly. And you feel his erect member pushing against your arse through his trousers.\n\n \n\n \"Who knew that Phillips was such a slut?\" you hear Manny quip. \"Maybe we should join them under the bleachers after school.\"\n\n \n\n For the rest of the lesson, Jake roughly claws at you through your blouse. He can't sit still, grinding against you, pushing you back into the desk every time an animal on the screen is taken by a male suitor.\n\n \n\n After what seems like an eternity, the tape grinds to a stop. The screen fades to static, the glow dimming. Groans break from the rows, a few jeers tossed into the lull. Jake’s grip loosens. You slide off his lap and stand, his hands falling away. He looks down at them, confusion flickering across his face as though he doesn’t quite know what he just did.\n\n \n \n Harrow claps his hands lightly. “Alright, boys. I hope you digested that practical demonstration. Let's show some appreciation for Miss. Phillips, there.\"\n\n \n\n There's some sniggers and whoops, with the sole exceptions of Dennis and Jake. The latter, you note, is lost in his own train of thoughts.\n\n \n\n The bell rings, making you jump. Chairs squeal, bodies push toward the door in a tide of laughter and chatter.\n\n \n\n Harrow intercepts you before you can slip out. His smile has sharpened again, polite but edged. \"Very good, Miss Phillips. You fit in quite nicely with my lesson plans. A more practical approach, wouldn’t you say?” He tilts his head, eyes lingering. “Perhaps we should discuss how you might help me tailor my teaching Over lunch at the Charlton Hotel, one Saturday?”\n\n \n\n The implication curls in your stomach, cold and wrong. You force a non-committal smile, mumbling something vague, and turn for the door.\n\n \n\n Out in the corridor, the air feels no lighter. Your pulse still thrums, your skin crawling under the echo of their cheers. And your womb yearns, almost a carnal need to be filled.\n\n \n\n You think back to Jake, feeling sick. More at what you said, but even still what he did. And yet, there was something not quite right with his reaction. Whatever’s happening in those lessons, you couldn’t grasp it just by watching. Not even by being pulled into it. To truly understand, you’ll need to be on the inside. To be a boy. To feel it for yourself.\n \n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You bury the thoughts on why you came here in the first place and concentrate on the here and now. Get ahold of yourself, you think. Here you are, bent over a desk, the school bully pushing up against you in his seat, a classroom of boys as spectators. This isn't alluring. It's dangerous.\n\n \n\n \"No!\", you exclaim. \"Get off me I said!\"\n\n \n\n The boys jeer and shout, their enthusiasm turning sour. Manny sniggers with malice. \"What a tease!\"\n\n \n\n But Jake doesn't let you go. He in fact forces you further into the desk. You feel his hand playing with the edges of your clit through your panties. \"Liar,\" he murmurs.\n\n \n\n A shadow falls over your face. You glance up, seeing Harrow smiling with satisfaction over you. \"Ease off, Jake,\" he says. \"I'm sure she'll be happy to continue this underneath the bleachers.\"\n\n \n\n \"Don't listen to him!\" you hear Manny cry. “Don’t let her go!”\n\n \n\n The room surges with testosterone, the atmosphere no longer even jovial banter. This, you feel, is an active threat.\n\n \n\n “Now now, boys,” Harrow says quickly, his usual polish faltering, real worry flickering in his eyes. But the class isn’t listening.\n\n \n\n Jake is standing now, his chest pushing hard into your back. His body tense like he doesn’t even recognise what he’s doing. The boys holler, urging him forward.\n\n \n\n “Jake, sit down,” Harrow stammers, the command shaky. But Jake doesn't.\n \n \n\n Then the room snaps.\n\n \n\n The TV dies with a crackle. The overhead lights flare on. You whirl, heart hammering. Dennis stands by the wall, cord in one hand, the light switch in the other. His face is pale but set.\n\n \n\n For a heartbeat, the room is frozen in silence. Then the boys erupt again, this time in boos, groaning and jeering. You feel Jake release you and you scurry away out of his grasp. When you're almost next to the door, you glance back. He’s still seated, chest heaving, eyes wild. But something else is there now. Confusion. Like he’s waking from a dream, unsure why he stood at all.\n\n \n\n “Okay, boys. That’s enough excitement for one day.” Harrow has already planted himself at the front of the class again, smile stretched thin. “I think we'll return to our textbooks for the remainder of the lesson.”\n\n \n\n Groans ripple across the room, but chairs squeal as boys slump back, opening desks, pulling out battered books. Jake takes deep breaths, silent, staring down at the desk. Not meeting your eyes.\n\n \n\n Harrow approaches you, his smile fixed but forced. “Thank you for your efforts, Miss Phillips. I think it’s best you return to your own classes for now.” He gestures lightly toward the door.\n\n \n\n You nod, the rush of adrenaline ebbing from you as you cross the room.

    "text": "The dogtags gleam in your hand. You draw a breath and speak again. \"From this item, I see you in your time of need. Now form shape to the person I see within.”\n\n \n\n The air tightens around you, humming with magic. You force Jake's image into your mind. Broad and muscled, wearing his quarterback jacket, scarred knuckles and cocky grin, his weight filling space, his swagger unchallenged.\n\n \n\n Magic bursts out from your chest, running across your body. Then the pain takes you. Your skin prickles, stretching from within. Bones grind and snap, shoulders grow wider. Ribs flaring, limbs lengthening. Your chest collapses inward and you feel your lungs swell larger as you suck in air. Hair recedes from your vision as though shorn away. Your hands balloon and you feel your veins surge through swollen forearms. As you finally let out a cry from the pain, it twists into a guttural sound, your voice now hoarse and heavy.\n\n \n\n Darkness claws at the edges of your vision. You grit your teeth and force yourself to hold on as your organs wrench and settle, your frame remade in his image.\n\n \n\n Then, silence.\n\n \n\n You stagger forward, panting, slick with sweat. The body feels heavy, rooted, brimming with strength. You glance down at your hands and flex them, feeling power ripple in your biceps.\n\n \n\n Glancing down, you catch your reflection in the shards of a broken beer bottle lying on the floor. Jake Duncan stares back at you, dark-haired and blue-eyed. His mouth forming into a sneer as you look at your reflection.\n\n \n \n Off to the side, Jake - the real one - lies still, breathing evenly, unaware. You feel a sense of pity for him, bested so easily by forces he can't possibly understand. His sleep no longer looking peaceful. He looks weak.\n\n \n\n The thought startles you, but you can't shake it. Something about being Jake means that it's all too easy to give into his callous nature. You feel your *assertiveness* has been impacted by your most recent change.\n\n \n\n This might actually benefit us.\n\n \n\n You turn, feeling refreshed with the athletic energy of this body. Paying little attention to the boy sleeping on the dirt. He'll cope. Or not.\n\n \n\n Yet again, you push the train of thought from your mind.

Cursing inwardly, you realise the amulet needs more time to re-charge.\n\n \n\n Glancing at Jake sleeping on the floor, you console yourself with the fact that at least he won't remember any of this. You'll have to try again when the amulet is charged and he's awake once more.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

She has everyone’s attention, at least.\n\n \n\n Turning back, you listen as Mrs. DeBussy continues her introduction. “In this lesson, we'll all learn how to perform the roles that you will gain when you leave Charlton. Many of my top students have gone on to be quite successful. I have no doubt that some of you will join them.”\n\n \n\n Her voice drops to a whisper, but her enthusiasm still shines through. “In business, you will find many of the skills employers expect are not those we would normally teach. Dictation and typing, for example, are of paramount importance. So today, you’re going to learn how it works. So each of you ladies, turn to the right of you. The men, turn to your left. And meet your study buddy for the day!”\n\n \n\n A creeping feeling rises up inside you. Turning to your left, you come face-to-face with a smirking man that you instantly recognise. Logain. Your boss’s son.\n\n \n\n “Hey squirt,” he greets you, not letting his grin slip.\n\n \n\n Tall, muscular and lean, you notice his striking blue eyes looking back at you. You look away briefly, squirming slightly underneath his stare. He seems to relish in your discomfort. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “Welcome, class!” Mrs. DeBussy says with a shrill tone. “Today we shall continue with this term’s topic.

A mousy girl with fashionable glasses and a permanent twitch of irritation. Chantelle.\n\n \n\n She rolls her eyes as you stand awkwardly behind her, fingers drumming the edge of her desk. It’s clear this isn’t the first time she’s been saddled with Dennis.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “Welcome, class!” Mrs. DeBussy says with a shrill tone. “Today we shall continue with this term’s topic.

She looks over her shoulder, flashing you a smile. There's a noticeable attempt from her to lean back towards you in her chair.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Welcome again!” DeBussy proclaims. “We are continuing with our dictation and typing lessons today. Since you all did such a good job last time, I can’t imagine you’ll need a reminder of what to do. So gentlemen, take your positions.”\n\n \n\n Chairs scrape across the floor as the boys stand up. You glance over at Logain, who gives you a smirk as he shrugs. He moves behind you and you feel his hands press down into the back of the chair, brushing against your back.\n\n \n\n “Ladies, look down at your typewriter. Let’s begin!”\n\n \n\n You look down at the white keys, hearing the chalk marking the blackboard at the front of the class. Hot air brushes past across your ear and you know Logain’s face is right next to yours.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Welcome again!” Mrs. DeBussy proclaims. “Today we continue with dictation and typing.

It’s clear this isn’t the first time she’s been saddled with Dennis.\n\n \n\n At the front, DeBussy takes up the chalk. “Now then. Gentlemen, you read aloud, clearly and carefully. Ladies, you type!”\n\n \n\n You lean in, ready to whisper the first line. But before the chalk has finished its first curve, Chantelle’s fingers are already hammering the keys.\n\n \n\n \n You blink, startled, watching the words spill across the page as if she had seen them before they appeared. The typewriter’s keys glow faintly, each strike puffing with a haze of yellow light. You glance up at the board and note how her lines match DeBussy's perfectly.\n\n \n You blink, startled, watching the words spill across the page as if she had seen them before they appeared. The shimmer on the keys is gone, but even so Chantelle seems to be typing before you can speak. She types faster than DeBussy can write, her expression intent and dismissive.\n\n \n \n\n When you try again with the next line, leaning closer to whisper, Chantelle swats the air near you with the back of her hand, yet never missing a key stroke.\n\n \n\n You stare, dumbfounded. This isn’t how it’s meant to work. She doesn’t need you at all. She isn’t just keeping pace. She’s outpacing the lesson.\n\n \n\n At the front, DeBussy beams at the sound of typebars clattering, utterly oblivious.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n “Welcome again!” Mrs. DeBussy proclaims. “Today we continue with dictation and typing.

There's a noticeable attempt from her to lean back towards you in her chair.\n\n \n\n “Ready?” DeBussy sings at the board, chalk already scratching. “Clear and careful dictation, please.”\n\n \n\n Michelle’s fingers hover above the keys, poised.

Diligent and precise, every word you give her caught and hammered into the page without hesitation.\n\n \n\n \n As you speak the words DeBussy scrawls on the blackboard, a quiet vacancy slides over Michelle's face. Her gaze dulls and her shoulders slack. She follows each of your sentences with machine regularity. Instruction. Response. Instruction.

    "text": "“Now,” DeBussy continues. “Gentlemen. I will write sentences on the board that you shall dictate to your counterpart. Ladies, you will type the exact words they say. As fast as you can, but without errors. Not that I expect many from you!”\n\n \n\n You look down at the typewriter. Despite its age, the layout is the same as a keyboard. At least you won’t struggle with this lesson.\n\n \n\n “If there are no questions,” DeBussy says. “Let us begin. Gentleman, please stand behind your receptionist for the day. Ladies, look down at your typewriter.”\n\n \n\n Chair legs scrape across the floor as the boys stand up. You focus on the typewriter in front of you, but feel Logain’s presence close to you. You bristle as you feel his hands rest on the back of your chair.\n\n \n\n You hear chalk scratching against the blackboard. Then, you feel Logain’s breath breeze across your ear. \n\n \n\n “A good secretary follows orders,” he whispers.\n\n \n\n Your eyes flick up to the front of the room. DeBussy stands to the side of the blackboard, where the sentence Logain uttered is written in stylish handwriting across the top of the board. She looks at you, expectantly.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Now,” DeBussy continues. “Gentlemen. I will write sentences on the board that you shall dictate to your counterpart.

Gentleman, please ensure you're standing behind your receptionist for the day. Ladies, look down at your typewriter.”\n\n \n\n At the front, she takes up the chalk. “Now then.

Feeling like you have no choice, you type the sentence out on the keys and hit return.\n\n \n\n The sounds of chalk marking the blackboard fill the room. You still feel Logain’s breath on your skin, his face close to your ear. You inhale, softly.\n\n \n\n “Compliance is an appealing quality,” you hear Logain say softly. You can hear the smirk in his voice.\n\n \n\n Typing out the words again, you feel yourself relax into the comforting monotony of typing. At least in this class I am doing something that I enjoy, you think.\n\n \n\n You again hear the sound of chalk on board. Logain leans in closer, his lips almost touching your lobe. “Beauty is your greatest asset,” he murmurs.\n\n \n\n You giggle as his words tickle your ear. Your laugh sounds sweet. Feverish. You type the sentence out, trying to avoid mistakes with your dainty fingers.\n\n \n\n Logain continues to dictate to you for the rest of the lesson. You settle into the rhythm of typing exactly what he says. After a while, you barely acknowledge the words. The sensation of doing a good job gives satisfaction. And Logain’s sultry voice sends shivers down your spine.\n\n \n\n Too soon, DeBussy tells the class the lesson is complete and instructs the boys to return to their seats. You glance up at Logain, his lean and muscular frame moving away. With some disappointment, you notice once the lesson has ended he doesn’t pay attention to you.\n\n \n\n “Well done, Miss. Phillips!” you hear DeBussy say from next to you, pulling your gaze from Logain. “You have a knack for this, I must say!”\n\n \n\n \n \n DeBussy squats down next to you, meeting your eye. “In fact,” she says quietly. “I think you’d fit in nicely in an after school club I run. It’s for the most promising students in my classes. Very exclusive. If that takes your interest, do drop by after school!”\n\n \n DeBussy squats down next to you, meeting your eye. “In fact, I'll be keeping an eye on you. I like to help those promising students deserving of my attention.”\n\n \n \n\n The bell rings and students begin to pack up to leave. You follow suit, glancing at Logain as he’s leaving. He gives you a look, but doesn’t smile. \n\n \n\n Grabbing your own belongings, you make your way to the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Without hesitation you type what Logain said into your ear. Free of the curse, you recognise the words for what they are. Demeaning, sexist and shameful.\n\n \n\n Logain continues to dictate to you, but you find it easier to concentrate. You type fast and efficiently. His presence over your shoulders is still there, but you now find it intrusive and annoying. \n\n \n\n \n With your increased speed, when you complete a sentence you have both the will and the time to look around the class. DeBussy watches, smiling. The rest of the class appears absorbed in the lesson.\n\n \n\n You notice some of the other girls shivering and smiling as their counterparts whisper into their ears. All of the boys have taken similar positions to Logain, firmly holding on to the backs of the girls' chairs, leaning over their shoulders and into their personal space.\n\n \n You find yourself completing each exercise quicker, giving you time to look up. Other girls sit quietly, they too having finished early. More interestingly, a number of them look over their shoulders, giving their counterpart dirty looks. One girl even swats a boy’s hands away from her chair.\n\n \n \n\n Not wanting to draw attention to yourself, you look back down at the typewriter and finish the lesson. When DeBussy calls for the class to stop, you sit back and relax. You feel Logain return to his seat.\n\n \n\n DeBussy walks down the aisle, glancing at the papers some girls have left in their typewriters. When she reaches you, she smiles.\n\n \n\n \n \n \"A stellar effort, once again,\" she says. “But what else would I expect from one of my most promising students.\"\n\n \n “Well done, Miss. Phillips!” she says. Then squats down to meet your eye. “In fact, I think you’d fit in nicely in an after school club I run. It’s for the most promising students in my classes. Very exclusive. If that takes your interest, do drop by after school!”\n\n \n “Well done, Miss. Phillips!” she says. Then squats down to meet your eye. “In fact, I'll be keeping an eye on you. I like to help those promising students deserving of my attention.”\n\n \n \n\n The bell rings. You pack up your belongings and walk to the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You hesitate only briefly, then begin to type what Logain said into your ear. You watch as the words appear on the paper in front of you, digesting them as you click your fingers on keys.\n\n \n\n The task might seem simple, you reflect, but after all you have been through there’s something therapeutic about it. You still find the words and sentences strange and demeaning, but you push away the thoughts. At least this is bringing you joy.\n\n \n\n You hear DeBussy continue to write things on the blackboard, which Logain dutifully dictates to you. After a while the words barely register. You glaze over, typing away, watching sentences appear on your paper that you don’t bother to read.\n\n \n\n What is also distracting you is the boy leaning very close to you. You shiver every time Logain whispers, his breath casting a wind against your skin. \n\n \n\n You can’t help but smile every time he does it. Your body reacts every time, a physical reaction as your sensitive flesh is tickled by his words. Fine hairs stand up on your arms. \n\n \n\n Another thought soon creeps up. There is something soothing about being told what to type. What to write. What to do, you mean?\n\n \n\n Once again you grimace when DeBussy tells the class the lesson is complete and ask the boys to sit down. You watch Logain walk back to his desk, but note that he still doesn’t look back at you.\n\n \n\n \n \n \"A stellar effort, once again,\" she says. “But what else would I expect from one of my most promising students.\"\n\n \n “Well done, Miss. Phillips!” she says. Then squats down to meet your eye. “In fact, I think you’d fit in nicely in an after school club I run. It’s for the most promising students in my classes. Very exclusive.

I like to help those promising students deserving of my attention.”\n\n \n \n\n The bell rings and students start to pack up. You do the same, glancing at Logain as he’s leaving. He doesn’t look back.\n\n \n\n Picking up your satchel, you walk to the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You look back down at the keyboard. A sly grin creeps over your face. You begin to type, ignoring the dictation Logain gave you.\n\n \n\n 'A good secretary ignores her sleazy boss.'\n\n \n\n You hear a snigger echo into your ear. You glance up at DeBussy, who stares back at you and Logain. She gestures towards your typewriter and you look back down.\n\n \n\n The sounds of chalk marking the blackboard fill the room. You hear Logain again whisper into your ear, this time with a hint of pep to it. “Compliance is an appealing quality.”\n\n \n\n Grinning, you begin to type again. 'Compliance is only appealing to limp losers.'\n\n \n\n You feel Logain shaking with laughter, but this time he is silent. Then, more sounds of chalk against the blackboard.\n\n \n\n “Emily Phillips is a real cutie,” Logain murmurs in your ear.\n\n \n\n 'Logain Thompson is an arrogant blowhard.'\n\n \n\n Your partner in crime continues to dictate to you for the rest of the lesson, telling you increasingly daring things to type. In turn, you write put-downs and retorts, denying him even the slightest compliance to his dictation.\n\n \n\n After some time, DeBussy tells the class the lesson is complete. As the boys return to their seats, you glance up at Logain, who is grinning at you. \n\n \n\n “I like a girl with spunk,” he purrs, before sitting back down.\n\n \n\n DeBussy walks around the office and you are quick to crumple up your paper and put it in the wastepaper bin at the side of your desk. She glances at you as she walks by, giving you a pleasant smile but says not a word.\n\n \n\n You gather your belongings together when the bell rings, briefly looking over to Logain as he does the same. He gives you a smirk as he leaves.\n\n \n\n With no reason to stay here, you finish packing up and leave yourself.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You smirk and begin to type. 'The only numbers you're good at is remembering the amount of girls who have rejected you.'\n\n \n\n Logain doesn't react. In fact, Logain barely pays you attention other than whispering into your ear. You glance up more than once and notice he's repeating exactly what is written on the whiteboard. \n\n \n\n Increasingly you type sentences that are far and away from what he's dictated, but nothing gets a rise out of him.\n\n \n\n \n You also dare to look around the class in-between exercises. DeBussy is always watching, smiling. But the rest of the class appears absorbed in the lesson.\n\n \n\n You notice some of the other girls shivering and smiling as their counterparts whisper into their ears. All of the boys have taken similar positions to Logain, firmly holding on to the backs of the girls' chairs, leaning over their shoulders and into their personal space.\n\n \n You find yourself completing each exercise quicker, giving you time to look up. Other girls sit quietly, they too having finished early. More interestingly, a number of them look over their shoulders, giving their counterpart dirty looks. One girl even swats a boy’s hands away from her chair.\n\n \n \n\n When DeBussy tells the class to stop, you look back at Logain. He stares at you, blankly and coldly.\n\n \n \n His blue eyes are enough to make you shiver and you momentarily lose your bearings. Only when DeBussy draws right to your desk do you remember to throw your paper away in the bin, hiding your work.\n \n \n\n A few minutes later the bell rings. You gather your belongings. Logain leaves without saying a word.\n \n \n You smirk and begin to type. 'The only numbers you're good at is remembering the amount of girls who have rejected you.'\n\n \n\n Logain sniggers behind you. You don’t react, instead looking up and seeing the sexist sentence scrawled across the blackboard. You can’t control me now, you think.\n\n \n\n Throughout the lesson, Logain continues to whisper things into your ear. With each one you look up and note that he soon is drifting off-topic. Each time, you refuse to relent, writing back to him insults and jibes that flow into your mind.\n\n \n\n \n You also dare to look around the class in-between exercises. DeBussy is always watching, smiling. But the rest of the class appears absorbed in the lesson.\n\n \n\n You notice some of the other girls shivering and smiling as their counterparts whisper into their ears.

One girl even swats a boy’s hands away from her chair.\n\n \n \n\n When DeBussy tells the class to stop, you look back at Logain, noting him grinning at you. \n\n \n\n “Pleasure as always, squirt,” he says. “Maybe I should attend classes more.”\n\n \n\n Aware of what you’ve written, you quickly scrunch up your typing and drop it in the bin. You smile at DeBussy as passes. She matches it and walks by.\n\n \n\n A few minutes later the bell rings. You gather your belongings, not acknowledging Logain watching you with interest.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You run your eyes over your keyboard and grin. You start to hit keys, ignoring the words Logain said to you.\n\n \n\n 'The only thing men can lead is how to get to a bar. When it comes to numbers, they tend to exaggerate.'\n\n \n\n Logain doesn't react. You look up and glance behind him. He purposefully doesn't meet your eyes.\n\n \n\n The rest of the lesson follows in a similar fashion. You hear DeBussy marking the blackboard and then Logain murmurs something to you. Glancing up, he's monotonously parroting back what's written.\n\n \n\n You try a few lines off-piece, but he doesn't respond. \n \n\n DeBussy soon tells the class that you’ve completed today’s exercise. The boys begin to move back to their seats. You look to Logain behind you. He stares back with disinterest.\n\n \n \n Placing your typed pages into the wastepaper bin by your desk, you give DeBussy a pleasant smile as she walks by. She returns it, but passes you without a word.\n\n \n\n Minutes later the bell rings. You stand up and gather your belongings.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You run your eyes over your keyboard and grin. You start to hit keys, ignoring the words Logain said to you.\n\n \n\n 'The only thing men can lead is how to get to a bar. When it comes to numbers, they tend to exaggerate.'\n\n \n\n You hear Logain snort behind you. You glance up to see DeBussy watching. You give her a slight shrug and return your attention to the typewriter.\n\n \n\n The rest of the lesson follows in a similar fashion. You hear DeBussy marking the blackboard and then Logain murmurs something to you. More and more, you grow sceptical that what he’s saying has any relation to what the teacher is writing.\n\n \n\n “Fancy some alcoholic-fuelled fun this evening?” Logain at one point whispers to you.\n\n \n\n 'No thanks.' you type. 'Watching you throw up after trying to drink hooch would give me the ick.'\n\n \n\n DeBussy soon tells the class that you’ve completed today’s exercise. The boys begin to move back to their seats. You look to Logain behind you. He is grinning.\n\n \n\n “You’re fun, squirt,” he tells you. “I like it.”\n\n \n\n Placing your typed pages into the wastepaper bin by your desk, you give DeBussy a pleasant smile as she walks by.

The words DeBussy writes flow straight onto the page, no need for you at all.\n\n \n\n At first you hover there, trying again to speak the words on the board once or twice, but she ignores you each time. Her focus is absolute, as though you don’t exist.\n\n \n\n DeBussy’s chalk keeps scratching. You read the words from the board, almost to yourself. “Diligence and obedience are desired qualities in secretaries.” Chantelle types every word flawlessly before you even mutter them.\n\n \n\n You stand back, letting her continue. The more she types, the clearer it becomes. She doesn’t need you. Your role of a boss is redundant. Her eyes glaze over, focusing on the keys. But in spite of her slackened posture, she continues quickly and efficiently. She could outpace the lesson on her own.\n\n \n\n By the time the bell rings, she looks blank but satisfied, her paper stacked neatly with page after page of perfect transcription. You, by contrast, feel diminished. You barely spoke. You barely mattered.\n\n \n\n “Well done, Chantelle!” you hear DeBussy say from next to you. “I expected nothing else from you.”\n\n \n\n She doesn't even look at you. Just shares a look with Chantelle, who smiles knowingly back at her. \"Thank you, Miss.\"\n\n \n \n Walking out of the classroom, you can still hear the rhythm of her keys echoing in your mind.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You lean in, but Chantelle’s hand flicks you away again, her fingers clattering at the keys without pause.

You lean closer, lips by her ear. “No,\" you murmur. \"Type this instead. The boss decides what matters.\"\n\n \n\n Her fingers falter. She glances between you and the board. “That’s not what she wrote.”\n\n \n\n You grin and repeat it slower, deliberate, each word pressed like a command. “The boss decides what matters.”\n\n \n\n Chantelle stiffens. “I’m not writ -”\n\n \n\n “Miss Marks,” DeBussy interrupts, turning sweetly from the board. “Is something wrong?”\n\n \n\n All eyes swing toward you both. Chantelle swallows. “Please, Miss, I cannot tell a lie. Dennis is changing what you are writing.”\n\n \n\n DeBussy’s smile hardens at the corners. “Good secretaries follow orders, Chantelle. And the lesson is simple. Transcribe what Master Mannet dictates. A secretary does not think. She obeys.”\n\n \n\n Chantelle’s mouth falls open. She looks between you and the teacher, but the room waits only for her fingers.\n\n \n\n When you lean in and whisper again. “The boss decides what matters.\" Chantelle hesitates only a moment before typing the words.\n\n \n\n The next line appears on the board. “A woman’s duty is to repeat, not to lead.”\n\n \n\n You murmur. “The boss commands, the secretary complies.”\n\n \n\n Her knuckles whiten on the keys, but she types your words instead.\n\n \n\n Line after line, you bend the exercise. Chantelle grimaces, then falters, then finally types only when you speak. By the end of the lesson, her scowls have melted away. She looks dazed, pliant, moving only when prompted.\n\n \n\n The bell rings. DeBussy beams at the class and waves them out.

Good girl.”\n\n \n\n She smiles again, coy but grateful, and you feel the weight of what you’ve just done.\n\n \n\n At the front of the room, Mrs. DeBussy beams over the fading clatter of typewriters. “Well done, class.

    "text": "**Charlton School - Business Studies Room**\n\n[image: ./images/School_Business_Studies_Room.png]\n\nThe business studies room looks similar to every other classroom at the school, except for one thing. On every other desk there are clunky black typewriters, with paper stacked up neatly beside each one.\n\n You enter the classroom to see a handful of students that you don’t recognise sitting on desks, roughly spread out in a semi circle. You note that they are all girls.\n \n \n\n Mrs. DeBussy stands in the centre of the group. She smiles when she sees you. “Emily! I’m so glad you decided to come! Sit down, sit down. Sit anywhere you like.”\n\n \n\n You take a seat at the edge of the group, smiling politely at the other girls who politely greet you. Following their lead, you angle yourself to face Mrs. DeBussy. \n\n \n\n “I was just telling the girls all about you!” she says once you are settled. “Top class work, Emily. Just the sort of calibre that this group aims for.”\n\n \n\n She then looks to the rest of the students. “Ladies, I’ll be spending some time with Emily, so have a chin-wag for the rest of today. Before that, though, let’s listen to what Chantelle had to say. You inferred someone was slipping in their studies, Chantelle?”\n\n \n\n A prim looking girl with thin, fashionable glasses starts to speak. “Yes Miss. I cannot tell a lie. Terrence hasn’t had a girlfriend since he’s been at school. And he actually turned down a date with someone this week.”\n\n \n\n Mrs. DeBussy's eyes narrow. \"Are you inferring he isn't… interested?\"\n\n \n\n Chantelle shrugs slightly. “I’m still trying to find out.”\n\n \n\n The teacher’s eyes widen and her mouth crawls up into a smile. “Please do, Chantelle. That needs to be addressed quickly.”\n\n \n\n Chantelle looks around to the rest of the girls, who give her encouraging looks. She blushes at DeBussy’s compliment.\n\n \n\n “Now. If you’ll excuse me, I have to get our latest member up-to-speed.” She gives you a smile.\n\n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You walk into DeBussy’s after school club and politely greet the other members of the club and Mrs. DeBussy herself, who smiles as she sees you. “Welcome back, Emily!”\n\n \n\n Sliding into a desk beside the other girls, you idly listen to their gossiping. Nothing of note stands out to you.\n\n \n\n After a few minutes, DeBussy turns from her current conversation and moves over to you, notebook in hand. “How delightful to see you again, Emily. I trust all is well with your studies?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “All good, thanks.” \n\n \n\n “Excellent,” she replies. “Now. On with business.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n <>",

    "text": "The rest of the group starts to chatter amongst themselves as Mrs. DeBussy walks over to you and sits down at the adjacent desk. “I’m so glad you’re here, Emily. I see great things ahead for you.”\n\n \n\n “Now,” she begins. “You must be curious as to exactly what this is about. As I mentioned, this is for my most gifted students. I give extra lessons, personal tutoring and a dollop of good old fashioned encouragement to make sure you all get the grades you deserve. After all, it can be a challenge at Charlton to remain focused on your studies. Some of your peers aren’t as dedicated as you are to your education.”\n\n \n\n Her smile wilts, just by a fraction. “I might seem like a doddering old auntie, Emily. But I’m not oblivious to what happens here. That is why we come together. To support each other and weed out the disruptors that are derailing your ability to focus.”\n\n \n\n “Weed out?” you repeat back, feeling an eyebrow rise.\n\n \n\n She nods. “You’re a smart cookie, Emily. I bet you have your ear to the ground. If you tell me who's not adhering to the high standards you yourself live by, I will deal with them. Your education is too important to risk letting them run rampant.” \n\n \n\n “Besides,” she continues, lowering her voice to a whisper. “With Prom coming up, I need to take a step back. The girls here are smart, but they need a leader. Someone to come in, set-up the club when I can’t make it, provide direction for the girls, and report back to me when necessary.”\n\n She stares back at you, judging your reaction intently. You nod.\n\n \n\n “If that sounds like something you’d be interested in, you just need to prove you have what it takes. And it should go without saying, my best pupil will not be getting anything other than a top grade in my class.” \n\n \n\n You mull over what DeBussy is implying. This would definitely help Emily. Plus, you’d be left alone to run in the classroom when DeBussy wasn’t here. Alone. \n\n \n\n “So,” DeBussy says, her voice back to her usual shrill volume. “Can you think of anything now?”\n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n DeBussy flicks through her notebook, reviewing the notes she’s made from what you’ve told her. “Very good, Emily,” she comments. “Very good indeed. You’ve painted quite the picture.”\n\n \n\n She smiles at you and turns around to the other girls to bellow in her shrill voice. “Excuse me, ladies. I have an announcement. As you know, with Prom coming up I’m feeling a little stretched. Thankfully, I appear to have been blessed with a solution.\n\n \n\n “I’m excited to tell you that in my absence, Emily will be stepping in to make sure the good work that you do here continues. I’m sure you’ll all agree that Emily’s contributions recently have showcased exactly the type of diligence we need to maintain the calibre of education you expect at Charlton.”\n\n \n\n Somewhat surprisingly to you, the girls look at you with excited smiles and give you a quick applause. You feel a sense of camaraderie from them that you weren’t even aware you were building.\n\n \n\n DeBussy turns to you and holds out a key in her hand. “This is a key to the classroom. As club president, you can come and go as you please. I can’t wait to hear about your next meeting. And naturally, I’ll be taking into consideration the workload of your extra duties when marking your coursework.\"\n\n \n\n You thank her and take the key, looking at it. You hope it’s worth the price you paid.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n DeBussy smiles at you sweetly, standing up with her notebook in one hand and a pen in the other. “Anything comes to mind?” she asks.\n\n \n\n You look back at the teacher, who waits patiently. The question is, what do you want to tell her?\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n <>\n\n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n\n “Very well,” DeBussy says, lowering her book. “Let’s see what you come up with next time. Don’t be a dilly-dallier though, Emily. I need to decide soon who’s going to take over for me.”\n\n \n\n With that, DeBussy moves back over to the other students and listens in to their conversations, taking notes as they chatter.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “Jake Duncan cheats at the town gym,\" you tell her. \"He hides small weights in-between bigger ones so it looks like he can lift more.\"\n\n \n\n DeBussy gives you a withering look, trying to muster a smile. \"Really dear? That's... interesting.\"\n\n \n\n She waits for you, expecting you to continue. You notice that she doesn't write anything in her book. This must not be something she's looking for.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I saw Reagan go into one of the rooms at the Charlton Hotel,” you begin. “With Mr. Harrow.”\n\n DeBussy looks up from her book and a wide, incredulous smile creeps across her face. “Reagan Archer?”\n\n You nod. DeBussy titters and scribbles down a note in her book. “Oh my.”\n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Michelle gets extra help from Mr. Rogers, after school,” you say to DeBussy. “That’s how she’s doing well in Maths.”\n\n DeBussy frowns. “And what do you mean by extra help?”\n\n You find yourself blushing. “I couldn’t say. I’ve not seen her in there.”\n\n A knowing smile spreads on DeBussy’s face. “I see,” she says, writing an unseen comment in her book. “I shall have to look into Mr. Rogers's approach to tutorage.”\n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Olaf, the janitor, gives favours to girls if they pose for pictures,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “What sort of favours?” DeBussy asks you. \n\n \n\n “Anything he can get them,” you reply. “He has access to most places in the school.”\n\n \n\n “And the photos?” she asks, lowering her voice. “Are they… inappropriate?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “He hangs them up in the basement.”\n\n \n\n DeBussy scribbles down a note. “I shall see to this immediately,” she tells you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Heather Oats stays behind to clean the gym every night.”\n\n \n\n DeBussy looks to you, expecting more. “And? Mr. Beach is known for using punishments to inspire fitness.”\n\n \n\n You take a small breath. “I don’t think it’s just cleaning she does in there with Mr. Beach.”\n\n \n\n The business studies teacher purses her lips and makes a note in her book. “I imagine you’re not the only person who’s noticed this transgression?”\n\n \n\n You shrug. DeBussy mumbles, then says nothing more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I spoke to Terrence,” you begin. “He told me he’s confused. About his sexuality.”\n \n \n\n This grabs DeBussy’s attention. “Oh really?” \n\n \n\n You nod. She eyes you for a moment, then writes something down in her book. “I’ll speak to Nurse Rancy,” she says as she writes. “He needs someone to talk to.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Well, Logain is trying to steal your notebook,” you tell her casually.\n\n \n\n She titters, smiling. “That one doesn’t surprise me. He’s a spirited lad. We all wonder what he’ll get up to next.”\n\n \n\n You pause, waiting for her to write. For some reason, she doesn’t note this one down.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Elizabeth Pleasant is looking into the occult,” you tell DeBussy. “She’s reading all sorts of things online. And is trying to practice it.”\n\n \n\n DeBussy snorts, derisively. “The things unpopular girls do for attention. But unapproved texts are not a laughing matter. I shall look into this, immediately.”\n\n \n\n She writes a note down in her book.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Dennis trades photos with the janitor for access to locked rooms in the school.”\n\n “What sort of photos?” DeBussy asks with concern.\n\n “Photos inside changing areas, as if from the vents. Or above the cubicles in the girls' toilets.\"\n\n DeBussy’s smile drops as she grinds her teeth. “I shall have to look into this. That is repugnant.” \n\n She scribbles down a note in her book.\n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I don't know if you'd be interested in this,\" you say, hesitantly.\n\n \n\n “I'm sure I would, dear.” DeBussy says, all-too quickly. \"It sounds important.\"\n\n \n\n “The receptionist at Thompson's Repairs. She's having lunchtime meetings with her boss. In a private room at the Charlton Hotel.\"\n\n \n\n DeBussy’s smile widens, almost reveling in the scandal. \"You did a good thing in telling me. Annie Clancy is a graduate of Charlton. We need to ensure former students maintain our standards. Even after graduating.”\n\n \n\n She scribbles down a note in her book.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

In spite of the grease, you find yourself almost enjoying the satisfaction of eating something substantial.\n\n \n\n \n With the food no longer cursed at least for you, your lunch causes you no adverse side effects. You look around the room, noticing other students aren’t so lucky. Girls, all munching on salads, are smiling and vacantly listening to the boys prattle and horseplay.\n\n \n\n You notice the boys chow down on their burgers and meat casseroles, barely stopping to swallow.

Looking around the cafeteria, you note that other people’s behaviour has changed. Girls have pushed their trays of salad away from them, with a few even stealing some of the boys' burgers. \n\n \n\n The boys, conversely, seem off their game. They engage with their typical horseplay and banter, but girls roll their eyes and look back at them derisively. Most are just ignoring them.\n\n \n\n You finish your lunch, feeling at least partially satisfied from the bland food. When the bell goes, most of the girls leave promptly. The guys watch after them, looking dumbfounded.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n After a few mouthfuls, you find yourself smiling faintly. It’s delicious, really. So healthy. Exactly what you need. Why would you have ever thought otherwise?\n\n \n\n A shadow falls across your tray. Brendan Glove leans down, thigh pressed almost against your arm, grinning broadly. “Hey. Haven’t seen you before. You new?”\n\n \n\n You look up at him, nerves fluttering, and nod quickly. “Yes. Just trying to fit in.”\n\n \n\n His grin widens. “You should come by the football field after school. I’ll be there.”\n\n \n\n The suggestion feels more like a command, and you feel warmth spread in your chest at the thought. “Of course,” you answer instantly. \n\n \n\n He laughs softly, satisfied, and strides away. You keep watching until he’s gone, cheeks warm, heart pounding. Maybe you should go see him on the field. After all, he told you to. Why wouldn’t you?\n\n \n\n The bell interrupts your thoughts, leaving you clutching your tray, eager for the day to be over.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n After a few mouthfuls, you grow accustomed to the taste. Actually, it’s kind of nice, you decide, surprised by your own thought. Good for you, good for keeping in shape. Maybe you shouldn’t complain so much.\n\n \n\n You glance up as Brendan Glove, one of the football players, looms over you. He plants a foot on the bench beside you, leaning close, grin wide. “Hey,” he says. “Don’t think I’ve seen you before. You new?”\n\n \n\n His leg is right there, filling your space. You ought to object, but the words won’t come. Instead you give him a quick smile. “Yeah. Just keeping quiet.”\n\n \n\n “That’s good,” he replies, eyes raking over you. “You should come by the field after school. We can hang out.”\n\n \n\n You hesitate, but it feels easier just to nod. “Alright.”\n\n \n\n Brendan grins at your answer before sauntering off. You watch him go, pulse quickening. He wants you there, you think. So shouldn’t you go?\n\n \n\n The bell rings, leaving you unsettled at how quickly you agreed.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n After a few mouthfuls, you grow accustomed to the taste. It’s not so bad, you think. At least it’s healthy. Good for your waistline.\n\n \n\n You begin to ponder where that thought came from, but are pulled out of your thoughts by Brendan Glove, one of the football players, looking down on you. \n\n \n\n He puts a foot up on the bench, leaning forward, grinning. “Hey,” he says. “I don’t think I’ve seen you around before. You new here?”\n\n \n\n Personal space must not be a concept Brendan has been introduced to, as his muscular thigh is uncomfortably close to you. Part of you feels like saying something, but you don’t want to offend him.\n\n \n\n “A little,” you say. “I just keep my head down.”\n\n \n\n “You can keep your head down for me, anytime,” he replies, giving you a leery look. “You should come see me after school on the football field. We can hang out.”\n\n \n\n “Okay,” you find yourself replying, in spite of having no intention of doing so.\n\n \n\n He grins, then nods to you and walks off.\n\n \n\n You watch him go. Maybe you will go and see him, you think. After all, he did tell you to.\n\n \n\n Lost in thought for the rest of the lunch break, you are only drawn away from considering Brendan by the bell.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n The more you eat, the more you find yourself enjoying it.

You are barely chewing before forcing half a potato into your hole. The ravenous feeling of hunger surges you on, shovelling more of the food into your mouth before you swallow.\n\n \n\n A girl glances over you, watching. A tingle of Dennis' nerves shoots up inside your body, but you find yourself grinning back at her. Even as you feel the fat spread around your lips.\n\n \n\n She stares at you vacantly. Then, after a moment, actually smiles.\n\n \n\n You finish your lunch and spend the rest of the break watching people. All the while smirking.

You hang up your towel and turn the taps on, feeling the warm water run down your skin.\n\n \n\n As you clean yourself, you look around the room. Though still foreign and eerie, you’ve become slightly more accustomed to showering with other girls. Other, being the word that ricochets around your skull. \n\n \n\n Looking around, you note that the sight of bums and breasts seems normal to you. That realisation is enough to send a shiver down your spine, but you can’t help but see the other students as your peers. When you’re in this body, at least.\n\n \n\n Once done showering, you walk back through to Emily’s locker and get changed back into your school uniform, ready to leave.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

You would certainly increase your standing with the cheerleaders if you put her in her place.*\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Liz glances up from her locker as you approach, her pink hair bright even under the corridor’s dim light. She squints at you, head cocked.\n\n \n\n “Dennis Mannet,” she says with a grin. “Of all people. Didn’t expect you to be creeping out of the AV Room.”\n\n \n\n You glance around, step closer, and drop your voice. “Liz. It’s me.”\n\n \n\n For a moment, there's confusion. Then her eyes widen. “Wait… what?” She stares at you, really stares, then drops her voice too. “?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “He’s… sleeping it off. In the AV room. Safe.”\n\n \n\n Liz lets out a sharp breath, then actually laughs. “You've taken to changing into boys now?” She shakes her head. “Why him?\"\n\n \n\n “For investigating,” you answer simply.\n\n \n\n She raises one eyebrow. “What could Dennis possibly know about what's going on?\"\n\n \n\n \"Just a different perspective,\" you reply quietly. \"Seeing Charlton from the boy's side.\"\n\n \n\n \"I bet,\" she murmurs. \"He does have a way of getting to places he shouldn't be.\"\n\n \n\n Then Liz leans in, tone sobering. “Be careful, alright? Dennis isn’t exactly popular. Walk around as him too long and someone’s going to decide it’s open season.”\n\n \n\n You nod, taking in her words.

Even if she were to believe you.\n \n \n \n \n \n Liz glances up from her locker as you approach, her pink hair bright even under the corridor’s dim light. Her eyes flick up as you approach and immediately narrow.\n\n \n\n “Well, if it isn’t Charlton’s golden boy,” she says flatly. Her grin is sharp, but not amused. “What do you want, Jake? Come to shove me into the lockers, or just sneer from up close?”\n\n \n\n You glance around, step closer, and drop your voice. “Liz. It’s me.”\n\n \n\n Her expression falters, confusion cutting through the bravado. “What?” She studies your face, searching for the catch. “Don’t play games with me.”\n\n \n\n “It’s not Jake,” you insist quickly. “It’s me. . He’s… sleeping it off. Safe.”\n\n \n\n Elizabeth blinks hard, then lets out a short, incredulous laugh. “You mean to tell me you’re walking around in Jake bloody Duncan’s skin?” She hisses the words, eyes darting down the corridor as if someone might overhear. \"Why?\"\n\n \n\n “For investigating,” you answer simply.\n\n \n\n She raises one eyebrow. “What could Jake possibly know about what's going on?\"\n\n \n\n \"Just a different perspective,\" you reply quietly. \"Seeing Charlton from the boy's side.\"\n\n \n\n “You’ve lost it,\" she barks, almost laughing. \"That’s not just crazy. It’s suicide.” She shakes her head. “Christina would have your throat if she caught even a whiff of this.”\n\n \n\n \"I can handle it,\" you tell her.\n\n \n\n She almost rolls her eyes. \"Spoken like a true man. Like Jake, even.\"\n\n \n\n \"I've got this,\" you assure her. \"It's just for investigating.\"\n\n \n\n Liz studies you, before letting out a breath and folding her arms. “I hope so.

She folds her arms, watching you with a mix of fascination and unease. “So. What now?”\n\n \n \n Liz glances up from her locker as you approach.

It’s her own little secret service in there.”\n\n \n\n “How do you know that?” you ask him, still watching him carefully.\n\n \n\n “I have my sources,” he replies. “There’s a notebook that she keeps in her desk.

Towards safety.\n\n \n\n Logain narrows a single eyebrow. \"You alright, chump?\"\n\n \n\n \"I've... got to go,\" you stammer, trying to fight the instinct to run.\n\n \n\n Logain shrugs as you dart down the corridor. You don't look back as you flee towards the exit.\n\n You make your way to the Business Studies classroom, naturally pacing so fast that you have to remind yourself you are trying to be stealthily. You feel almost careless in whether you're caught, irritated by impatience to find out what's going on.\n \n \n\n Approaching the door to the classroom, you reach out and slowly turn the handle. To your surprise, it turns. You are just about to boldly enter when you hear voices from behind the door.\n\n \n\n Fighting the urge to barge in, you instead pause and listen.

We on first-name terms now, sport?\"\n\n \n\n Studying the other boy, you hesitate for a second to judge him. \"Why wouldn't we be?\"\n\n \n\n Logain smirks. \"Quite right. Live and let live. And as we're such pals now, why don't you tell me what you're doing here?\"\n\n \n\n You find yourself growing irritated by Logain's vague statements and perpetual grin. It almost feels like he's playing with you. You feel your chest tightening. \"What's it to you?\"\n\n \n\n \"Just a friendly bit of conversation,\" he replies. \"Between such good friends.\"\n\n \n\n The tightening in your chest coils further. You feel your fingers shake, as if wanting to curl up into a fist.\n\n \n\n \"I've got to go,\" you spit. And without a word, you stride off, leaving Logain behind. Uninjured.

Britney in particular suddenly seems less interested in exercising and more in trying to hear your conversation.\n\n \n\n \"No slacking, Britney,\" Christina barks without turning back to face her. \"I can afford the luxury of taking some time out to chat.

She hardly glances at you as you step closer.\n\n \n\n \"Jake,” she says, brisk, already turning back to the squad. “We’re in the middle of a routine. This needs my focus.”\n\n \n\n For a moment it feels like you’re not even here. Just another distraction to be brushed aside. But then she looks at you properly, and something flickers across her face. A calculation.\n\n \n\n Her lips curve into a slow, knowing smile. “Later this week. My parents are out.” A gleam lights her eyes, the promise unspoken but unmistakable. “We’ll have the house to ourselves. We can talk then. Among other things.”\n\n \n\n She lets the words hang, before turning back to her squad with a crisp clap of her hands. The girls shuffle back into formation, her attention already reclaimed by them.\n\n \n\n “Britney! How many times do I have to tell you that pouting is not a cheerleader motion!” \n\n \n\n You’re left standing at the edge of the field, the promise lingering like perfume, designed to keep you close even as she walks away.\n \n\n Christina stands facing you, a pleasant smile across her face.

Then with a dramatic flourish, you arch your back and slide your hands back up your legs, flipping your hair into the air.\n\n \n\n You hear a few whistles from the bleachers as you look up. And see Reagan, scowling at you.\n\n \n\n Spluttering nearby takes your attention. You turn to see Michelle staggering around, as she loses her footing trying to match you. Strands of her hair are caught in her mouth.\n\n \n\n And the song suddenly breaks into the bridge section, the beat changing.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n Playing it safe, you stand on the spot and circle your hips, listening to the music blaring from the boombox.\n\n \n\n *Boys in the rearview, they can't help but stare,\n\n Playing it cool, but I know they care.\n\n We laugh and we dance, like no one’s around,\n\n Feeling so fierce, yeah, we’re taking the crown.*\n \n \n\n You run your hands down your waist, subtly swishing your bum around in time with the beat. Michelle matches you easily, almost syncing to your movements. She grins, unaware that the crowd on the bleachers have begun to chat amongst themselves.\n\n You run your hands down your waist, subtly swishing your bum around in time with the beat. Michelle follows you, almost syncing to your movements. She grins as she looks back into the crowd on the bleachers, who have begun to chat amongst themselves.\n\n \n\n Christina’s voice snaps out a retort. “Is that all you’ve got?” \n\n \n\n Then the song suddenly breaks into the bridge section, the beat changing.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n So turn the music up, let’s lose control,\n\n We’re living for today, that’s how we roll.\n\n Boys can try to catch up, but they’ll never keep pace,\n\n ‘Cause we’re the queens of our own wild space.\n\n \n\n Feeling flushed from the movement, the music compels you to make a wave motion along your body. You turn to the bleachers and lift your chest, much to the delight of the boys watching. You no longer pay attention to the other cheerleaders.\n\n \n\n You arch your back as you turn your back to the crowd and stick your bum out, tucking in your stomach as you finish the roll. You grin as you hear a few cheers and you repeat the movement, over and over again.\n\n \n\n Looking off to the side, Michelle tries to mimic your technique. She doesn’t have the rhythm for it, making her look as if she’s suffering from a spasm. She looks at you, wincing.\n\n \n\n “Looking good, Emily,” you hear Christina say. “Keep it up.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n So turn the music up, let’s lose control,\n\n We’re living for today, that’s how we roll.\n\n Boys can try to catch up, but they’ll never keep pace,\n\n ‘Cause we’re the queens of our own wild space.\n\n \n\n Dropping into a slight squat, you push your hands out in front of you and shake your arms and fingers towards the crowd. You match the new beat, but judging by the disinterest from the crowd you know it’s hardly inspiring.\n\n \n\n Thankfully Michelle has no problem performing the move. She shakes her hands out in front of her body, grinning with excitement.\n\n Thankfully Michelle has no problem performing the move.

You slowly run your hands down your legs, your torso getting lower and lower, feeling your arse jiggling high in the air.\n\n \n\n A number of the football players whoop and whistle. You even get a catcall. “Yeah! Shake that arse!”\n\n \n\n As you come up, you coyly look over your shoulder back to the stands. The boys are grinning at you. Stacey and Britney watch with hints of impressed surprise. Reagan sneers.\n\n \n\n Michelle tries to copy you, but she’s not flexible enough. Halfway down she stops twisting her hips, unable to get lower. You hear Christina chuckle.\n\n \n\n “Give us a big finish, Em!” she tells you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n You listen to the music, becoming just a little less self-conscious as the tryouts continue.

They are paying no attention to you.\n\n \n\n Michelle watches from off to the side. You give her a wry smile and you watch as she mimics your actions. I can’t believe a girl is trying to compete with me dancing.\n\n Michelle watches from off to the side. You give her an encouraging smile and she mimics your actions. She’s a bit too enthusiastic still, but she beams with delight. I can’t believe a girl is following my lead in dancing.\n\n \n\n Meeting Christina’s gaze, you see her roll her eyes. She doesn’t look impressed. \n\n \n\n “Big finish, Em,” she mutters, as you sense the song coming to an end.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n You grin widely as the music speaks to you, giving you a command loud and clear. Without thinking, you drop down to your hands and knees, absorbed by the music. \n\n \n\n *Yeah, we’re shining, we’re bold,\n\n With stories of our lives waiting to be told.\n\n Flaunt it, flaunt it, let the whole world see,\n\n This is our time, just you and me!*\n\n \n\n You turn your head to the side, looking back at the boys watching you intensely. You grin and dive your head down, back arched, your booty tooted in the air.\n\n \n\n As you push your body along the floor and come to a rest position on the grass, the boys break out into applause. You roll on to your back, crossing your legs, staring up at them, smiling. \n\n \n\n Michelle gives you a look, then nervously copies your actions. But exhausted, she doesn’t have the upper arm strength left. As she drops down her face plunges into the ground.\n\n \n\n The boys stop cheering and start laughing. You even see Christina smiling with menacing satisfaction.\n\n \n\n Michelle rolls back on to her back, panting, her face red with embarrassment.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n As the music nears its end, you shake your body to the crescendo. Michelle matches you, smiling as she dances.\n\n \n\n *Yeah, we’re shining, we’re bold,\n\n With stories of our lives waiting to be told.\n\n Flaunt it, flaunt it, let the whole world see,\n\n This is our time, just you and me!*\n\n \n\n With a final note, you throw your hands up into the air. Anticipating the move, Michelle does the same. You glare at each other, as you both pant for air.\n\n With a final note, you throw your hands up into the air. Anticipating the move, Michelle does the same. You look at each other, panting and grinning in equal measure.\n\n \n\n There is a smattering of applause from a few of the football players. Otherwise, silence.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n Once you’ve regained your breath, you walk over to Christina with Michelle. She watches you both approach, her smile polite and revealing nothing.\n\n \n\n \n ”Just as I thought,” Christina tells you. “You’ve got some moves, Emily. And you’re definitely fit enough. Maybe with a little work…”\n\n \n\n She glances at your face. “Come see me at lunch. We’ll go on a little trip to the salon. They can work wonders.”\n\n \n\n “What about school?” you ask her. \n\n \n\n She smiles. “Cheerleaders get special privileges at Charlton. Don’t worry. You won’t get in trouble. If you want to join, I insist. And I think you’re exactly what we need.”\n\n \n\n You can’t help but smile from the validation. Then you notice Christina turns to Michelle with a hard look.\n\n \n\n “Sorry ‘shell,” Christina tells her. “Like I said, there’s only one spot on the team.”\n\n \n\n You watch Michelle, crestfallen. She lets out a gentle sniff. “I understand,” she says quietly. “Thanks for letting me try out. Congratulations, Emily.”\n\n \n\n Christina gives her a sympathetic smile, then turns over to the bleachers. “Show’s over. Time to get back to it.” There’s some mutterings from Stacey, Britney and Reagan, but begrudgingly they begin to walk over to the field. “I’ll see you at lunchtime,” Christina tells you, before joining them.\n\n \n \n \n Left with Michelle, you stand in awkward silence. She stares at you. Then, without a word, she storms off.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Left with Michelle, you stand in awkward silence. “Thanks anyway, Emily,” she says, no hint of her usual enthusiasm in her voice. \n\n \n\n ”A deal’s a deal, though,” she adds. “I’ll give you the key to the maths room.”\n\n \n\n Sure enough, after the two of you get changed, she hands you the key. Without saying much, Michelle leaves you, heading home.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ”I think I’m going to get changed and go home,” she says.

I thought you’d be a shoo-in. But I was wrong.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at her, looking for malice. There is none. Only genuine disappointment on her face. She gives you an apologetic smile, then turns her attention to Michelle.\n\n \n\n “I don’t think it’s going to work for you, either,” she continues. “You just don’t have what we need.”\n\n \n\n You watch Michelle, crestfallen. She lets out a gentle sniff. “I understand,” she says quietly. “Thanks for letting me try out.”\n\n \n\n Christina gives her a sympathetic smile, then turns over to the bleachers. “Show’s over.

His breath catches for a split second before he steadies himself, clearing his throat. \n\n \n\n “Hi there,” you say, offering a gentle smile. \n\n \n\n He returns your smile, though it’s tentative, as if he’s unsure whether you’ll smile back. “Emily, isn't it?” he ventures, voice soft, eyes flicking down at your feet before meeting your gaze again. \n\n \n\n His hands fidget at his sides, fingers brushing his backpack strap as he stands, body turned slightly toward you yet laced with hesitation. \n \n \n You lean against the stone pillar next to the entrance, mindful to stay out of sight from the school windows. At this time of day the school is unusually quiet. As you wait only a handful of students exit, giving you a cursory glance as they pass by. \n\n \n\n After a while you catch the sight of Terrence hurriedly rushing across the school yard. He jumps into the air at the sight of you.\n\n \n\n “Hi there,” you say, smiling pleasantly. \n\n \n\n “Hi,” he says hurriedly, his eyes looking around. \n\n \n\n “Terrence, right?”\n\n \n\n He nods, quickly. “That’s right. You’re Emily.” It’s less of a question than a statement. \n\n \n\n Terrence looks at you, but his eyes keep drifting to look up and down the street. \n \n \n You lean against the stone pillar next to the entrance, mindful to stay out of sight from the school windows. Terrence appears around the corner, walking with deliberate ease. His shoulders are relaxed, and he offers you a steady, confident smile as he approaches. \n\n \n\n “Hi there,” you say, smiling pleasantly. \n\n \n\n He holds your gaze immediately. “Emily, isn't it?” he asks, voice calm and warm, eyes bright with interest.

As is customary for him, he jumps when you emerge from hiding. \n\n \n\n “Hey Em,” he says, after regaining his composure. “Are you okay?”\n \n \n You wait for Terrence to finish his detention, heart in your throat as you press back into the shadows beneath the windows. \n\n \n\n When he finally appears, he freezes for a moment and gives a little jump as he sees you. He rubs the back of his neck, gaze flicking between your face and the empty yard. \n\n \n\n “Um. Hey, Em,” he murmurs, voice low and hesitant. His eyes look at you with nervousness. “Are… you okay?”\n\n \n You wait for Terrence to finish his detention, keeping out of sight from any of the windows looking down over the school yard. \n\n \n\n At last he strides out of the main doors, shoulders squared and eyes immediately locking onto you. He doesn’t jump this time. Instead, he offers a confident half-smile as if he’s been looking forward to seeing you. \n\n \n\n “Hey, Em,” he says, voice warm and steady.

How’ve you been?”\n\n \n You wait for Terrence to finish his detention, heart in your throat as you press back into the shadows beneath the windows. \n\n \n\n When he finally appears, he freezes for a moment and gives a little jump as he sees you. \"H-hi, Dennis,\" he stammers, glancing aside as if worried someone else might be watching.\n\n \n\n He fidgets with the strap of his bag, shifting from one foot to the other.\n\n You lean against the stone pillar next to the entrance, mindful to stay out of sight from the school windows.

I have a problem with Dennis.”\n\nIt’s enough to catch his attention. “Oh?” \n\nYou lean in towards him, lowering your voice. “He’s been up to old tricks. I caught him yesterday taking photos of me. From underneath the stairs.”\n\nYou watch as Jake’s face rolls up into an unlikely pairing of glee and anger. “Are you serious?” he asks you. “He’s doing that again?”\n\nNot waiting for a reply, Jake pushes you aside and strides towards Dennis. “Hey! Nerd! What did I tell you about taking photos of girls from under the stairwell?” \n\nFear spreads across Dennis’ face instantly. “I didn’t!” he stammers. “Or haven’t! Since that one time!”\n\n“That’s not what I’ve been told,” Jake barks at him. He shoves the smaller boy against the railings, holding his face between two steel bars. “You calling them a liar, nerd?”\n\nYou watch as Dennis begins to shake. “I didn’t! I haven’t! I swear!”\n\n“Liar!” Jake grabs Dennis by his collar and throws him to the pavement. Other students cease their chatter and freeze, watching the altercation break out.\n\n“This is what happens when people don’t do what I say!” Jake shouts. And time seems to slow down as you witness Jake curl his leg back and then bury it in Dennis’ stomach.\n\nDennis cries out in agony. Jake kicks him again, eliciting another cry. Then another. And another. “Stop taking photos of girls, nerd!” he shouts.\n\n“Alright!” you hear Coach Beach scream as he comes running out of the school. Jake freezes. There is a long moment where only the whimpering of Dennis can be heard.\n\nBeach looks between Dennis and Jake, mulling over his response. “Get to class, Jake.”\n\nThe quarterback nods and walks off, giving you a smirk as he passes you. \n\nBeach reaches down and hoists Dennis to his feet. You see the tears in the boy’s face. “Go see Nurse Rancy, Dennis. It looks like you tripped.”\n\nDennis looks at the coach for a moment, but sniffles and nods. You watch him walk into the school. Within a minute, students are going back to their business, although you hear the whispers of gossip about Dennis and his photography.\n\nChristina should be happy with this one, you think, trying not to consider what Dennis now has to live with at school.

You instinctively try to move out of their way, but before you can do they side-step without even looking up at you. Whatever effect the necklace has, it seems to be working.\n\n \n\n You hesitate, just for a moment, as you consider what awaits you inside. Using the necklace, you have no doubt you can sneak in undetected. You’ve even considered a good hiding place - behind the mat’s trolley in a small alcove that stores all the gym equipment.\n\n \n\n But if they are about to perform the ritual, you don’t know what will happen.

    "text": "“Today’s lesson continues your learning of the perils of foreign countries and their deviant fauna, wildlife and… *residents*,” Ms. Prichard begins. “Foreigners are awash with diseases, impure intentions and moral decay. This goes for their homelands.”\n\n \n\n She points to a chalk map of the world on the blackboard. A few of them have been annotated, listing out dangers. Some are valid threats. Others are thinly veiled xenophobia.\n\n \n\n Prichard empties a pack of chalk on to the empty desk at the front of the room. “Today, each of you in turn will come up to the blackboard and pick a country. You will then write as many dangers as you can come up with relating to it. Remember what you’ve already learned in class, ladies. Spiders and bears are rudimentary threats. But don’t forget the threats to your virtue. Let’s begin.”\n\n \n\n One by one, you watch each student approach the blackboard with chalk in hand and choose a country. You note with relish how Ms Prichard looks frustrated when a student picks a tangible threat. She even rolls her eyes when Brittany, a curly haired beach blonde girl in a cheerleader uniform, writes temperature for Antarctica. Comparatively, you are sure you see her licking her lips when another student writes ‘loose women’ for Amsterdam. \n\n \n\n Soon it is your turn to stand up. Prichard beckons you forward and you grab a piece of chalk. With the obvious countries taken, you choose Italy as Jennifer always talks about travelling there.\n\n \n\n You write down the ones that have come up in your research. *Petty crime*, *Pick pocketing*, *Bag snatching*. You even write down Earthquakes, as you discovered they occur several times a year.\n\n \n\n Prichard watches you intently as you scratch chalk against the blackboard. With each stroke you make, you begin to feel nervous about the country. Why does Jennifer want to visit such a dangerous place, you think. *Not like here.*\n\n \n\n “Good, Miss. Phillips,” Prichard says, a thin smile. “What else could be a threat to you in Italy?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Today’s lesson continues your exploration of global opportunity,” Ms. Prichard begins, her tone clipped and precise. “Geography is the study of power. Not of where borders lie, but of where they should lie, and where men should draw them.” \n\n \n\n She steps to the blackboard, where a chalk map of the world has been outlined in bold strokes. But this is no ordinary world map. Borders are incorrect. Empire-era names have replaced modern ones. Territories once coloured independent are again under the Union Jack.\n\n \n\n She lifts a thin wooden pointer and taps it across regions with rhythmic force. “You will each come forward and choose a country. Your task is to outline how we should claim it. Strategic resources. Political leverage. Cultural suppression. You may use the pins and string for planning naval or land-based routes.” She smiles faintly. “This is not a history lesson. It is a map of tomorrow.”\n\n \n\n \n One by one, the boys take their turns. As they step up and mark the board with the chalk, the energy in the room shifts palpably. Competitive, boisterous, eager. Strategies are shouted before they reach the board. “Naval control of the Med!” says one. “Undermine the local government,” says another. Each seems more emboldened than the last.\n\n \n\n Soon it is your turn to stand up. Prichard beckons you forward and you grab a piece of chalk. With the obvious countries taken, you choose Italy as you recall Jennifer discussing that in your travel plans. You note a number of crudely drawn submarines off the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n \n\n You scrawl a line from one to the coast. Feeling a surge of confidence as you envision troops landing there. “Good,” Prichard murmurs. “The coast of Italy is an easy target. Flat terrain leads to a rapid deployment.” Pausing, you look back to the class. The other boys watch you with curiosity. Smirks emphasising their impatience for you to continue your plan.\n\n \n\n \n The boys go up in turn, but something is wrong. One approaches, selects India, and then hesitates. “Miss… didn’t we already leave there?” he asks. The others frown. Another mutters something about “modern treaties.”\n\n \n\n The classroom grows still. Prichard’s lips part slightly. She does not speak. A third student shrugs and sits down without writing anything. Soon it is your turn to stand up. Prichard beckons you forward and you grab a piece of chalk.\n\n \n\n With the obvious countries taken, you choose Italy as you recall Jennifer discussing that in your travel plans. You note a number of crudely drawn submarines off the Mediterranean Sea. You scrawl a line from one to the coast. But without the impact of the chalk, you feel more foolish than assured in charting out an imaginary invasion of Italy by British troops.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard says, without her usual conviction. “The coast of Italy is an easy target. Flat terrain leads to a rapid deployment.” Pausing, you look back to the class. The other boys watch you, but their faces are filled with confusion. One sniggers at her words.\n \n \n One by one, the boys step forward. The tension in the room builds with each new strategist. Laughter becomes harder, louder. Boasts are flung across desks. “Cut off their water,” one says. “Marry into the elite and then fracture it from within,” says another. \n\n \n\n By the time you rise, the map looks half conquered already. You choose Italy as you recall Jennifer discussing that in your travel plans. You note a number of crudely drawn submarines off the Mediterranean Sea. You scrawl a line from one to the coast. Feeling a surge of confidence as you envision troops landing there.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard murmurs. “The coast of Italy is an easy target. Flat terrain leads to a rapid deployment.” Pausing, you look back to the class. The other boys watch you with curiosity.

Not of where borders lie, but of where they should lie, and where men should draw them.”\n\n \n\n She steps to the blackboard, pointer in hand. The world map behind her is no ordinary map. Borders are wrong, names resurrected from empire. Territories once coloured free are again shaded under the Union Jack.\n\n \n\n She raps the pointer against the board, sharp and rhythmic. “You will each come forward and choose a country. Your task is to outline how we should claim it. Strategic resources. Political leverage. Cultural suppression. You may use the pins and string for planning naval or land-based routes.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes sweep the rows. When they pass over you, there is no challenge, no derision. Just the faintest twitch at the corner of her lips, approval held tightly in check. She does not need to name you. Your aggression, your certainty, is exactly what she wants.\n\n \n\n “Turn that energy,” she says evenly. “To the lesson at hand.”\n\n \n\n Around you, the boys square their shoulders, their smirks sharpening. No sideways jabs, no muttered mockery. Instead, glances your way are measuring and competitive. As if daring you to prove yourself against them.\n\n \n\n \n One by one, the boys step up to the board. Each claim sharpens the air further. They bark strategies before chalk hits slate. “Naval control of the Med!” one calls. “Crush the local government!” another adds. The energy builds, rowdy but focused.\n\n \n\n When your turn comes, you rise without hesitation. Italy seems obvious, the choice almost instinctive. You recall Jennifer had once mentioned it in travel plans. You sketch a line of submarines through the Mediterranean, cutting into the coast.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard murmurs. “The coast of Italy is an easy target. Flat terrain, rapid deployment.”\n\n \n\n The boys behind you lean forward, smirking, impatient to see what you’ll draw next.\n\n \n The lesson falters. A boy picks India, then frowns. “Didn’t we already leave there?” he mutters. Another shakes his head, talking of treaties. The room shifts, confusion prickling.\n\n \n\n Prichard stills. Her lips part slightly, but no correction comes. A second boy shrugs, chalk idle in his hand. A third sits down without a mark.\n\n \n\n When you’re called, you take the chalk and mark Italy. Submarines scattered across the Mediterranean, a crude line to the coast. It feels hollow, a pantomime of power rather than the thing itself.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard says, but her voice carries none of its usual conviction. “Flat terrain, rapid deployment.”\n\n \n\n You glance back. The boys are watching, but not with hunger. There are frowns. A half-snigger from the back echoes across the room.\n \n \n The lesson ignites. Each boy who takes the chalk scratches furiously, as if the battle will be won in the blackboard. Boasts fly across the room. “Blockade the ports!” one shouts. “Starve them out!” calls another. Laughter rises, sharp and eager.\n\n \n\n You can feel the effects of the lesson bury into your chest, hot and insistent. Every mark on the board feeds the feeling. What should be a lesson feels like staging ground, conquest inevitable, borders nothing more than prey to carve.\n\n \n\n By the time your turn comes, the map is already scarred with arrows and pins. You seize the chalk, almost grinning as you scrawl a line of submarines across the Mediterranean. The coast of Italy waits, open, waiting.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard murmurs. Her eyes gleam as she watches you. “Flat terrain. Rapid deployment.”\n\n \n\n Behind you, boys lean forward, smirks curling wider. They want to see how far you’ll go.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ms. Prichard lays out some chalk on the empty front desk again and points to the blackboard. \n\n \n\n “We will continue listing out the dangers of countries around the world, ladies. You may choose to fill in any country you can add to, today. Please begin, Miss Oats,” she says, motioning Heather to the front of the room.\n\n \n\n Quickly it is your turn and you are ushered up. Prichard watches you as you pick up the chalk and begin to write a few examples of dangers that you know.\n\n \n\n \n You begin to write the dangers. Thanks to your removal of the curse, the writing has no effect on you. Unlike your other fellow students, who seem to be scared with every word they write.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You begin to write the dangers.

Smirks emphasising their impatience for you to continue your plan.\n\n \n\n \n The boys go up in turn, but something is wrong. One approaches, selects India, and then hesitates. “Miss… didn’t we already leave there?” he asks. The others frown. Another mutters something about “modern treaties.”\n\n \n\n The classroom grows still. Prichard’s lips part slightly. She does not speak. A third student shrugs and sits down without writing anything. Soon it is your turn to stand up. Prichard beckons you forward and you grab a piece of chalk.\n\n \n\n With the obvious countries taken, you choose Italy as you recall Jennifer discussing that in your travel plans. You note a number of crudely drawn submarines off the Mediterranean Sea. You scrawl a line from one to the coast. But without the impact of the chalk, you feel more foolish than assured in charting out an imaginary invasion of Italy by British troops.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard says, without her usual conviction. “The coast of Italy is an easy target. Flat terrain leads to a rapid deployment.” Pausing, you look back to the class. The other boys watch you, but their faces are filled with confusion. One sniggers at her words.\n \n \n One by one, the boys step forward. The tension in the room builds with each new strategist. Laughter becomes harder, louder. Boasts are flung across desks. “Cut off their water,” one says. “Marry into the elite and then fracture it from within,” says another. \n\n \n\n By the time you rise, the map looks half conquered already. You choose Italy as you recall Jennifer discussing that in your travel plans. You note a number of crudely drawn submarines off the Mediterranean Sea. You scrawl a line from one to the coast. Feeling a surge of confidence as you envision troops landing there.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard murmurs. “The coast of Italy is an easy target. Flat terrain leads to a rapid deployment.” Pausing, you look back to the class. The other boys watch you with curiosity. Smirks emphasising their impatience for you to continue your plan.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Today’s lesson continues your exploration of global opportunity,” Ms. Prichard begins, her tone clipped and precise. “Geography is the study of power. Not of where borders lie, but of where they should lie, and where men should draw them.”\n\n \n\n She steps to the blackboard, pointer in hand. The world map behind her is no ordinary map. Borders are wrong, names resurrected from empire. Territories once coloured free are again shaded under the Union Jack.\n\n \n\n She raps the pointer against the board, sharp and rhythmic. “You will each come forward and choose a country. Your task is to outline how we should claim it. Strategic resources. Political leverage. Cultural suppression. You may use the pins and string for planning naval or land-based routes.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes sweep the rows. When they pass over you, there is no challenge, no derision. Just the faintest twitch at the corner of her lips, approval held tightly in check. She does not need to name you. Your aggression, your certainty, is exactly what she wants.\n\n \n\n “Turn that energy,” she says evenly. “To the lesson at hand.”\n\n \n\n Around you, the boys square their shoulders, their smirks sharpening. No sideways jabs, no muttered mockery. Instead, glances your way are measuring and competitive. As if daring you to prove yourself against them.\n\n \n\n \n One by one, the boys step up to the board. Each claim sharpens the air further. They bark strategies before chalk hits slate. “Naval control of the Med!” one calls. “Crush the local government!” another adds. The energy builds, rowdy but focused.\n\n \n\n When your turn comes, you rise without hesitation. Italy seems obvious, the choice almost instinctive. You recall Jennifer had once mentioned it in travel plans. You sketch a line of submarines through the Mediterranean, cutting into the coast.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard murmurs. “The coast of Italy is an easy target. Flat terrain, rapid deployment.”\n\n \n\n The boys behind you lean forward, smirking, impatient to see what you’ll draw next.\n\n \n The lesson falters. A boy picks India, then frowns. “Didn’t we already leave there?” he mutters. Another shakes his head, talking of treaties. The room shifts, confusion prickling.\n\n \n\n Prichard stills. Her lips part slightly, but no correction comes. A second boy shrugs, chalk idle in his hand. A third sits down without a mark.\n\n \n\n When you’re called, you take the chalk and mark Italy. Submarines scattered across the Mediterranean, a crude line to the coast. It feels hollow, a pantomime of power rather than the thing itself.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard says, but her voice carries none of its usual conviction. “Flat terrain, rapid deployment.”\n\n \n\n You glance back. The boys are watching, but not with hunger. There are frowns. A half-snigger from the back echoes across the room.\n \n \n The lesson ignites. Each boy who takes the chalk scratches furiously, as if the battle will be won in the blackboard. Boasts fly across the room. “Blockade the ports!” one shouts. “Starve them out!” calls another. Laughter rises, sharp and eager.\n\n \n\n You can feel the effects of the lesson bury into your chest, hot and insistent. Every mark on the board feeds the feeling. What should be a lesson feels like staging ground, conquest inevitable, borders nothing more than prey to carve.\n\n \n\n By the time your turn comes, the map is already scarred with arrows and pins. You seize the chalk, almost grinning as you scrawl a line of submarines across the Mediterranean. The coast of Italy waits, open, waiting.\n\n \n\n “Good,” Prichard murmurs. Her eyes gleam as she watches you. “Flat terrain. Rapid deployment.”\n\n \n\n Behind you, boys lean forward, smirks curling wider. They want to see how far you’ll go.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>",

    "text": "Despite knowing that the chalk will have no further effect, you turn your back to the blackboard and put the chalk down. “I can’t think of anymore,” you say.\n\n \n\n Prichard’s eyes narrow and she snarls. “Girls like you are why this lesson is on the curriculum,” she spits. “If you won’t participate and see the dangers of the world for yourself, then I shall employ other methods to correct your deviant mind. Return to your seat and see me after school!” \n\n \n\n You return back to your desk. Whether out of principle or other means, you decided that you wouldn’t indulge Prichard’s teachings. You are thankful when the bell rings, but you are aware you will have to return after school to face the consequences of your non-compliance.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You take a deep breath and put the chalk down. “I can’t think of anymore,” you tell Prichard quietly.\n\n \n\n Her eyes narrow and her mouth clenches, as she fights back rage. “You can’t, Miss. Phillips. Or won’t?” You shrug, trying to avoid direct confrontation.\n\n \n\n “Girls like you need special treatment,” she snaps. “I see your deviant mind all too clearly. We shall deal with your attraction to vices in detention. Return to your seat, Miss. Phillips. I will waste no more of my ladies' time absorbing your corruption. You can waste only my time after the school day is finished.”\n\n \n\n Without a choice, you walk back to your desk. You see the other students eying you with fear. When the bell rings, you avoid their worried stares and the angry scowl of Ms. Prichard.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n Despite knowing that the chalk will have no further effect, you turn your back to the blackboard and put the chalk down. “I'm not doing this,” you say. \"This is like alternate history.\"\n\n \n\n The room stills for a beat. You glance back to the classroom, noting incredulous looks exchanged from the rest of the students. For a moment, a sense of pride sets into your bones.\n\n \n\n It's unfortunately shortlived. Prichard’s heels crack against the boards as she strides forward, eyes blazing. “You think this is optional, Master Mannet? You think you can simply decide when the lesson ends?”\n\n \n\n She draws a sharp breath, lips curling in fury. \"I think deviants like you belong in detention!\"\n\n \n\n Before you can respond, there's a cough from the back. You look over to see Brendan leaning forward in his chair, voice smooth.\n\n \n\n \"Coach Beach needs Mannet to sort the video camera before the game, Miss. Said he’d be lost without him.”\n\n \n\n Prichard’s gaze snaps to Brendan, then back to you. Her eyes narrow, livid, but she only responds with irritation. “Very well. But understand this, Master Mannet. I will be speaking to Mr. Harrow. And to Coach Beach. Personally.”\n\n \n\n She leans in, lowering her voice for only your ears. “You are not a favoured student, Master Mannet. The rules still apply to you. And no matter how hard you try to exceed, you will never be exempt from them.”\n\n \n\n Her heels click back to her desk. You linger for only a moment longer, then walk back to your seat. You notice the stares from the other boys as you move past them.\n\n \n\n \"Alternate history,\" you hear someone mutter. \"He's not wrong.\"\n\n \n\n You take your seat, avoiding Prichard's glare as the lesson continues. When the bell rings, you avoid her and race out towards the corridor.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Despite knowing that the chalk will have no further effect, you turn your back to the blackboard and put the chalk down. “I'm not doing this,” you say. \"This is like alternate history.\"\n\n \n\n The room stills for a beat. You glance back to the classroom, noting grins from the rest of the students. Then, the room erupts with laughter.\n\n \n\n “Mannet can’t even finish a drawing!”\n \n \n\n The laughter is cut short by Prichard’s heels cracking against the boards as she strides forward, eyes blazing. “You think this is optional, Master Mannet? You think you can simply decide when the lesson ends?”\n\n \n\n She draws a sharp breath, lips curling in fury. \"I think deviants like you belong in detention!\"\n\n \n\n Before you can respond, there's a cough from the back.

You notice the scoffs and sniggers from the other boys as you move past them.\n\n \n\n \"Mannet couldn't lead a piss-up to a brewery,\" you hear someone say.\n\n \n\n You take your seat, avoiding Prichard's glare as the lesson continues. The remaining students stand up and mark up the board, and one by one they grin at you when Prichard offers them praise.\n\n \n\n \"That's how you run an Empire,\" Manny mutters, kicking a leg of your chair as he passes.\n\n \n\n The lesson passes slowly. When the bell rings, you gather your belongings and dash to the exit, eager not to confront your classmates as you leave.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n The chalk sits heavy in your grip. The lines on the board blur as the jeers at your back pound like drums. Every stroke of chalk wants to pull you deeper and to push harder, but you slam it down onto the ledge and turn away.\n\n \n\n “I’m done,” you mutter, forcing the words out. “This is dumb.”\n\n \n\n \n The room bristles. For a heartbeat there’s silence, before you hear someone whisper. \"Finally.”\n\n \n\n Prichard’s heels click sharp against the floor as she steps forward. The faint smile she’d worn all lesson has vanished. Her voice cuts, crisp and cold. “Disappointing, Mr. Duncan. Very disappointing. The son of the Mayor, unwilling to prove himself a loyal British subject. I expected more from you.”\n\n \n\n She lets the words hang, then twists the knife further. “Your brother certainly showed more conviction when he stood where you do now.”\n\n \n\n The mention of Jake's brother strikes like a lash. Heat surges through your body, boiling, uncontrollable. You clench your fists, jaw locked tight. But you push down whatever bubbled up inside of you deep into your body. You glare back at Prichard, waiting for her to speak.\n\n \n\n \"Get back to your desk,\" she spits, turning her back to you.\n\n \n\n You spin around and stride back to your seat, ignoring the curious looks that follow you. Prichard occasionally stares back in your direction as the lesson continues. The remaining students stand up and mark up the board, but any traces of enthusiasm they might have had have long gone since your outburst. Now there is just robotic repetition by a group that wants to get to the end of the lesson and leave.\n\n \n\n As the lesson unravels in front of Prichard, her attention keeps turning to you. She doesn't say anything more, but you see the anger in her eyes. Burning.\n\n \n\n You match it with a furiousity of your own, continually coming back to her taunt about Jake's brother. The lesson passes slowly. When the bell rings, you gather your belongings and storm over to the exit, feeling the anger and embarrassment threatening to surge into any conversation that an unfortunate student might try.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n The room bristles. For a heartbeat there’s silence, before you hear someone whisper. \"What? He’s quitting?”\n\n \n\n “Now you know why we lost the last game.”\n\n \n \n Prichard’s heels click sharp against the floor as she steps forward. The faint smile she’d worn all lesson has vanished. Her voice cuts, crisp and cold. “Disappointing, Mr. Duncan. Very disappointing. The son of the Mayor, unwilling to prove himself a loyal British subject. I expected more from you.”\n\n \n\n She lets the words hang, then twists the knife further. “Your brother certainly showed more conviction when he stood where you do now.”\n\n \n\n The mention of Jake's brother strikes like a lash.

Prichard occasionally stares back in your direction as the lesson continues. The remaining students stand up and mark up the board, and one by one they grin at you when Prichard offers them praise.\n\n \n\n \"That's what a winner looks like,\" Manny mutters, kicking a leg of your chair as he passes. The rage swells yet again.\n\n \n\n The lesson passes slowly. When the bell rings, you gather your belongings and storm over to the exit, feeling the anger and embarrassment threatening to surge into any conversation that an unfortunate student might try.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n You continue to write about any dangers that come to your head. You and Jennifer have made plans to visit so many places across the world, so you can list them off easily. But despite spending your time writing down worrying thoughts, you feel that you can consider them with moderation, knowing that everywhere has its good and bad sides.\n\n \n\n You also avoid any obvious cliches and misrepresentations of people. Prichard watches you with a cold glare that grows harsher as you ignore her prompts to look down on the countries that you are writing about. You are careful not to anger her, but you tactfully ignore her when she speaks about perverts and deviants that can be found abroad.\n\n \n\n Once done, you return to your desk and watch casually as others do the same. You are thankful when the bell rings, signalling the lesson has ended.\n\n \n You continue to write dangers as they come to your head. You think about not only the animals and wildlife and poisonous plants that could cause you harm, but the criminals, thieves and characters of low virtue that could wish to cause harm to you.\n\n \n\n Prichard smiles as she watches you write. “That’s right, Miss. Phillips. Think about your virtue, your innocence. Filthy foreigners, wanting to corrupt your purity. Why would you ever wish to visit?”\n\n \n\n You find yourself nodding. By the time you have finished and have returned to your desk, you are fraught with worry about the many dangers you have listed. You know that the school is having an impact on you, but you can’t help but think that once this is all over, maybe you should talk to Jennifer about whether your plans to travel are wise to continue with. Things are safe here, after all.\n\n \n\n For the remainder of the lesson, you find yourself dwelling on what you have written. When the bell rings, you are thankful that you are safe here.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n The chalk bites against the board, but free from the curse you consider it nothing other than a fantasy. You scratch out supply lines and landing fronts, but your investment is no more than what you'd attached to a board game. It almost seems silly.\n\n \n\n Behind you, the boys have grown louder. A roar of approval whenever you jab the chalk hard into a capital, whistles when you cut off a border. One slaps his desk and shouts your name, another barks a laugh. “Didn’t think he had it in him!”\n\n \n\n The energy surges around you, but you only feel pity for the students sitting at their desks. The curse from the chalk has seeped into their being. To anyone in their right mind, this dated exercise of Imperial might would be laughable. But under the effects of magic, they have embraced it. Hook, line and sinker.\n\n \n\n From the corner of your eye, you catch Ms. Prichard. She hasn’t moved, pointer resting lightly against her skirt. But her eyes are on you. Gleaming, hard, approving.\n\n \n\n You pause, the chalk pressed halfway down the board. Once again you mark out a line from the sea to the land, another fictional invasion that will never come to pass.\n\n \n\n Once done, Ms. Prichard steps forward, pointer in hand. She taps it sharply against the board, the crack cutting through the murmurs. “A spirited showing. Well done, Master Mannet. Take your seat.”\n\n \n\n As you walk back to your desk, a number of boys nod to you with approval. Manny, one of the quarterbacks, even offers you a grin. \"That's how you show them,\" he mutters with appreciation.\n\n \n\n Another boy steps up and the lesson continues. The roars and cheers continue to swell. By the end, the blackboard looks like chalk scrawl. Less of an invasion plan and more a pinboard of someone suffering with paranoid delusion.\n\n \n\n The bell rings and students go to gather up their belongings, but Prichard slaps her pointer down on her desk, drawing silence out once more. Her eyes sweep the room. “Geography is not a parlour game. It is the study of power. And power requires conviction. Some of you displayed it. Others…” Her gaze sharpens. “…still lack the backbone their Empire demands.”\n\n \n\n The boys mutter, some with pride, others with smirks.\n\n \n\n Prichard raps the pointer one last time against the desk. “Dismissed.”\n\n \n\n The boys shove away from their desks, loud and boisterous, already mocking one another as they file out.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n The chalk bites against the board, but free from the curse you consider it nothing other than a fantasy. You scratch out supply lines and landing fronts, but your investment is no more than what you'd attached to a board game. It almost seems silly.\n\n \n\n Behind you, the boys seem to agree. Little attention is paid to your markings. In fact, a number of the boys are covertly mocking your movements. \"God save the King,\" one quips with derision.\n\n \n \n The energy in the room is one of barely contained contempt from the class, and bottled anger from Prichard. To anyone in their right mind, this dated exercise of Imperial might would be laughable. Prichard, however, surveys the class with rage. \"Silence!\" she barks, whenever the mockery ascends beyond a mutter.\n\n \n\n She turns back to you, watching with interest. Almost hope. You pause, the chalk pressed halfway down the board. Once again you mark out a line from the sea to the land, another fictional invasion that will never come to pass.\n\n \n\n Once done, Ms. Prichard steps forward, pointer in hand. She taps it sharply against the board, the crack cutting through the murmurs. “A spirited showing. Well done, Master Mannet. Take your seat.”\n\n \n\n As you walk back to your desk, a number of boys roll their eyes as you pass. \"Long live the kingdom of the nerds, Mannet.\" Manny, one of the quarterbacks, whispers as you pass.\n\n \n \n Another boy steps up and the lesson continues. The remaining students stand up and mark up the board, but any traces of enthusiasm they might have had have long gone. Now there is just robotic repetition by a group that wants to get to the end of the lesson and leave. By the end, the blackboard looks like a half-finished exercise abandoned at the end of an exam.\n\n \n\n The bell rings and students go to gather up their belongings, but Prichard slaps her pointer down on her desk, drawing silence out once more. Her eyes sweep the room. “Geography is not a parlour game. It is the study of power. And power requires conviction. Some of you displayed it. Others…” Her gaze sharpens. “…still lack the backbone their Empire demands.”\n\n \n\n \"This is such bullshit,\" you hear a boy mutter.\n\n \n\n Unhearing, Prichard raps the pointer one last time against the desk. “Dismissed.”\n\n \n\n The boys shove away from their desks, muted and deadened, barely speaking as they file out.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n The chalk bites against the board, each line you draw cutting sharper. With it you feel surer. At first it feels like mere marks to depict supply lines and ports, but then something else takes hold.\n\n \n\n The scratch of chalk sharpens into a kind of rhythm. The map no longer looks inert. It’s alive, brimming with weakness to exploit. A coastline is not just badly marked line, but terrain to prey upon. A dotted line is not just an illustrative route, but a supply line to disrupt.\n\n \n \n Behind you, the boys have grown louder. A roar of approval whenever you jab the chalk hard into a capital, whistles when you cut off a border. One slaps his desk and shouts your name, another barks a laugh. “Didn’t think he had it in him!”\n\n \n\n The energy surges around you, and for the first time you can feel it in you. Your shoulders square. Your back straightens. Each mark feels less like practice and more like command.\n\n \n\n From the corner of your eye, you catch Ms. Prichard. She hasn’t moved, pointer resting lightly against her skirt. But her eyes are on you. Gleaming, hard, approving.\n\n \n\n You pause, the chalk pressed halfway down the board. In your mind the battle is already raging. You can see it as clear as if you stood above it.\n\n \n\n Some part of you knows this is wrong. That there are dark arts at play on your mind. But as the effects of this classroom seeps into your body, you feel the physical hormones flooding your nervous system. You grin as you feel you know you've charted too far down this course to back out now. You're not seeing a blackboard. You're seeing a warplan. And everything inside your body pushes you to finish it.\n\n \n\n Two lines intersect in front of you. An image forms in your brain. Troops on the frontline, pinned down in a trench. Machine gun fire spitting out above them. The chances of support slim.\n\n \n\n Their cries for aid echo in your ears, broken only by the explosions of mortars. Yet the enemy is within touching distance. With one swipe of the chalk, you're certain that image inside your head will turn to a victory parade. If you can stomach their sacrifice.\n\n \n\n Behind you, the boys jeer and clap, calling for blood, for boldness. Urging you forward. Press harder. Faster. Take their cities, their ports, their people. Show the room that you deserve the right to conquer.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n [Colonial Right] Protect your troops - *The desire to win that you've previously expressed overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n\n \n [Empire's Shield] Press the assault - *The desire to protect your troops overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n\n \n\n \n The chalk bites against the board, but free from the curse you consider it nothing other than a fantasy.

A roar of approval whenever you jab the chalk hard into a capital, whistles when you cut off a border. One slaps his desk and shouts your name, another barks a laugh. “That's it, Jake!

Take your seat.”\n\n \n\n As you walk back to your desk, a number of boys nod to you with approval.

You scratch out supply lines and landing fronts, but your investment is no more than what you'd attached to a board game. It almost seems silly.\n\n \n\n Behind you, the boys seem to agree. Little attention is paid to your markings. In fact, a number of the boys are covertly mocking your movements. \"God save the King,\" one quips with derision.\n\n \n \n The energy in the room is one of barely contained contempt from the class, and bottled anger from Prichard. To anyone in their right mind, this dated exercise of Imperial might would be laughable. Prichard, however, surveys the class with rage. \"Silence!\" she barks, whenever the mockery ascends beyond a mutter.\n\n \n\n She turns back to you, watching with interest. Almost hope. You pause, the chalk pressed halfway down the board. Once again you mark out a line from the sea to the land, another fictional invasion that will never come to pass.\n\n \n\n Once done, Ms. Prichard steps forward, pointer in hand. She taps it sharply against the board, the crack cutting through the murmurs. “Well done, Master Duncan. At least the Empire still has one son that takes civic duty seriously. Take your seat.”\n\n \n\n As you walk back to your desk, a number of boys roll their eyes as you pass. \"All hail Mayor Jake,\" Manny, one of the quarterbacks, whispers as you pass. He only quivers back when he sees your glare.\n\n \n \n Another boy steps up and the lesson continues. The remaining students stand up and mark up the board, but any traces of enthusiasm they might have had have long gone. Now there is just robotic repetition by a group that wants to get to the end of the lesson and leave. By the end, the blackboard looks like a half-finished exercise abandoned at the end of an exam.\n\n \n\n The bell rings and students go to gather up their belongings, but Prichard slaps her pointer down on her desk, drawing silence out once more. Her eyes sweep the room. “Geography is not a parlour game. It is the study of power. And power requires conviction. Some of you displayed it. Others…” Her gaze sharpens. “…still lack the backbone their Empire demands.”\n\n \n\n \"This is such bullshit,\" you hear a boy mutter.\n\n \n\n Unhearing, Prichard raps the pointer one last time against the desk. “Dismissed.”\n\n \n\n The boys shove away from their desks, muted and deadened, barely speaking as they file out.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n The chalk bites against the board, each line you draw cutting sharper. With it you feel surer. At first it feels like mere marks to depict supply lines and ports, but then something else takes hold.\n\n \n\n The scratch of chalk sharpens into a kind of rhythm. The map no longer looks inert. It’s alive, brimming with weakness to exploit. A coastline is not just badly marked line, but terrain to prey upon. A dotted line is not just an illustrative route, but a supply line to disrupt.\n\n \n \n Behind you, the boys have grown louder. A roar of approval whenever you jab the chalk hard into a capital, whistles when you cut off a border. One slaps his desk and shouts your name, another barks a laugh. “That's it, Jake. Show them who's superior!”\n\n \n\n The energy surges around you, and for the first time you can feel it in you. Your shoulders square. Your back straightens. Each mark feels less like practice and more like command.\n\n \n\n From the corner of your eye, you catch Ms. Prichard. She hasn’t moved, pointer resting lightly against her skirt. But her eyes are on you. Gleaming, hard, approving.\n\n \n\n You pause, the chalk pressed halfway down the board. In your mind the battle is already raging. You can see it as clear as if you stood above it.\n\n \n\n Some part of you knows this is wrong. That there are dark arts at play on your mind. But as the effects of this classroom seeps into your body, you feel the physical hormones flooding your nervous system. You grin as you feel you know you've charted too far down this course to back out now. You're not seeing a blackboard. You're seeing a warplan. And everything inside your body pushes you to finish it.\n\n \n\n Two lines intersect in front of you. An image forms in your brain. Troops on the frontline, pinned down in a trench. Machine gun fire spitting out above them. The chances of support slim.\n\n \n\n Their cries for aid echo in your ears, broken only by the explosions of mortars. Yet the enemy is within touching distance. With one swipe of the chalk, you're certain that image inside your head will turn to a victory parade. If you can stomach their sacrifice.\n\n \n\n Behind you, the boys jeer and clap, calling for blood, for boldness. Urging you forward. Press harder. Faster. Take their cities, their ports, their people. Show the room that you deserve the right to conquer.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n [Colonial Right] Protect your troops - *The desire to win that you've previously expressed overcomes you.*\n\n <>\n \n \n [Empire's Shield] Press the assault - *The desire to protect your troops overcomes you.*\n\n <>",

    "text": "Ms. Prichard soon strides into the room, firmly shutting the door behind her. She looks you up and down, disdainfully.\n\n \n\n “So nice to see you, Miss. Phillips,” she says with thinly-veiled venom to her tone. “It’s time you learned what the world does to girls like you when they go out and flaunt themselves. Stand up!”\n\n \n\n Faced with no choice, you stand up from your desk. Prichard’s eyes wander up and down your legs and uniform, her eyes narrow and nose turned up in a sneer. “Look at you,” she chides. “Depraved! Deviant! I’ve seen your type, rolling their slutty little skirts up for attention from boys. It might be safe to act like that in Charlton, but this evening we’ll make sure you understand what the world does with trollops like you.”\n\n \n\n She walks over to her desk and picks up a piece of chalk, then moves back to the blackboard. “You are going to write lines. From the top of the board to the bottom. Follow my lead.”\n\n \n\n You notice her free hand move to touch her necklace, an odd looking pendant in the shape of the school logo. Then she begins scrawling words out on the board, chastising you as she writes.\n\n \n\n “The world is a dangerous place for all girls. If you won’t change your behaviour, I will at least make sure you leave this school with the knowledge that if you continue to indulge your deviance that world won’t be as lenient as I am.\n \n \n\n “There”, she adds, writing the last word and holding the chalk out to you. “Your turn.”\n\n \n\n Only then do you read what she’s written at the top of the blackboard.\n \n \n\n *I will not question how dangerous the world is for naughty little sluts like me.*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n You step up to the blackboard, taking the chalk in-hand. Even in heels, you have to stand on your toes, feeling your skirt rise up as you lean forward. For the first time you are grateful that it’s just you and Prichard in the room.\n\n \n\n *I will not question how dangerous the world is for naughty little sluts like me.*, you mark out at the top, underneath the example.\n\n \n\n “Good girl,” you hear Prichard tell you. “Continue.”\n\n \n\n As you begin to write the lines, your mind turns to some of the teachings from Prichard’s lesson. All the dangers that the students listed about the different countries in the world. You think back to news you’ve heard, stories of young girls being abducted in foreign places, their passports withheld, forced to do some unspeakable things.\n\n \n\n A thought pops into your head. Especially girls who flaunt themselves. Naughty. Little. Sluts.\n\n \n\n You are brought out of your thoughts by a knock on the door. You and Prichard both look over, seeing the face of Terrence through the window.\n\n \n\n Prichard huffs and walks over to the door, swinging it open. “Yes Mr. Handle?” she asks him with irritation.\n\n \n\n “Please Miss. Prichard,” Terrence says meekly. “I don’t mean to interrupt. But Mr. Stitch was wondering if you could go to the football field. He has concerns about the length of the cheerleaders skirts today. He thinks they’ve been misusing the home economics equipment to shorten them.”\n\n \n\n You hear Prichard blow air out of her nostrils. “Those little trollops!” she spits. “I’ll get my ruler.”\n\n \n\n She strides back over to her desk and picks up a wooden ruler. Walking back to the door, she glances at you, suddenly disinterested. “Continue, Miss. Phillips. You may go once you’ve completed the exercise.”\n\n \n\n With a slam of the door behind her, you are left alone to investigate the classroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You step up to the blackboard, taking the chalk in-hand.

Especially girls who flaunt themselves. Naughty. Little. Sluts.\n\n \n\n You are suddenly pulled from your thoughts by a shriek from the corridor. Both you and Prichard turn around to look at the glass pane in the door. You see Liz’s face, her nostrils pressed up against the glass. \n\n \n\n “Hey Prichard!” she cries, and plants her lips against the window, leaving lip marks from bold black lipstick against the glass.\n\n \n\n “You little tramp!” Prichard cries, striding over to the door. She swings it open, but Liz has already bolted up the corridor. Without giving you a second glance, Prichard bounds after her, leaving you alone and free to investigate the classroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You step up to the blackboard, taking the chalk in-hand.

You and Prichard both look over, seeing the face of Christina through the window.\n\n \n\n Prichard huffs and walks over to the door, swinging it open. “Yes, Miss. Evans?” she asks her with irritation.\n\n \n\n “Mr. Stitch told me to come find you,” Christina says, giving you only the briefest of acknowledgement. \"Apparently there's some nerds underneath the bleachers again, trying to take photos of the cheerleaders. He wants you go to find them.\"\n\n \n\n You hear Prichard tut. \"Very well. If the headmaster wishes it, I shall go. This school is descending into a gaggle of deviants, Miss. Evans.”\n\n \n\n Christina nods. \"Yes Miss.\" She gives you a look, then walks off.\n\n \n\n Prichard glances at you, suddenly disinterested. “Continue, Miss. Phillips. You may go once you’ve completed the exercise.”\n\n \n\n With a slam of the door behind her, you are left alone to investigate the classroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You walk forward and take the chalk from Prichard, then step in front of the blackboard. You have to stand on your toes to reach the top, feeling your skirt rise as you do so.\n\n \n\n *I will not question how dangerous the world is for naughty little sluts like me.*, you mark out at the top, underneath Prichard’s example.\n\n \n\n “Good girl,” you hear Prichard tell you. “Continue.”\n\n \n\n You write the lines, aware that the chalk you’re holding no longer has any effect on you. Given what you know about the Curse, you can guess what effects writing these words on the blackboard would have on your mind.\n\n \n\n Fortunately, with the curse no longer active, your mind remains clear. As uncomfortable as writing these words are, they have no hold over you.\n\n \n\n Prichard chides you throughout the detention, telling you about how girls like you are easy marks for dangerous foreigners and your flaunting behaviour will get you into trouble. You make sure to nod at the correct times, but don’t let it bother you. You note that she seems to relish the words, as if there’s something more to her lingering on how girls these days show themselves off to get attention from men.\n\n \n\n Soon enough you finish off the last line on the blackboard, careful to bend at your knees to write at the bottom. You give the chalk back to Prichard and smile politely. “All done, Miss.”\n\n \n\n She eyes you for a moment, coldly. “Thank you, Miss. Phillips. I hope you’ve learned your lesson.”\n\n \n\n “Yes Miss,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “Very well. You may leave.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You step up to the blackboard, taking the chalk in-hand. Even in heels, you have to stand on your toes, feeling your skirt rise up as you lean forward.

Especially girls who flaunt themselves. Naughty. Little. Sluts.\n\n \n\n You continue writing the lines. *Like me.*\n\n \n\n “Young girls like you are first in the firing line,” you hear Prichard tell you. “Liberal little princesses who show off their assets and think they can get away with it. Little sluts, teasing men with their lithe bodies. Well, the world doesn’t share your sense of empowerment, Miss. Phillips. You are a danger to yourself.”\n\n \n\n You nod as you write. What she is saying has at least some truth. You know how men think. The world is full of dangers. To girls. To you.\n\n \n\n *Because you’re a naughty little slut.*\n\n \n\n When you finish off the last line at the bottom of the blackboard, you are very aware of how precarious your stance is, bending over at the waist to write the final line. But as you give the chalk back to Miss Prichard, you can only think of what would happen if you did that in more dangerous parts of the world. Not like Charlton, where at least it’s safe here.\n\n \n\n “Thank you, Miss. Phillips,” Prichard says, taking back the chalk. “I hope you’ve learned your lesson.”\n\n \n\n “Yes Miss,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “Very well. You may leave.” \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You look between the blackboard and the piece of chalk, then shake your head. “I’m not going to write that,” you tell Prichard flatly.\n\n \n\n She snarls her teeth at you. “You’re refusing to do your detention?” \n\n \n\n “I don’t want to write that,” you reply. \n\n \n\n She takes a deep breath, barely keeping her anger constrained. “You little harlot,” she begins. “You are on thin ice, girl. Expulsion is a very real possibility for you. The world doesn’t treat high-school drop-outs kindly. You might think it’s fun and games now, but the depraved jobs they give to delinquents grow tiresome. Even for girls like you.”\n\n \n\n The icy atmosphere is suddenly interrupted by a knock on the door. You and Prichard both look over, seeing the face of Terrence through the window.\n\n \n\n Prichard huffs and walks over to the door, swinging it open. “Yes Mr. Handle?” she asks him with irritation. \n\n \n\n “Please Miss.

Walking back to the door, she glances at you. “You may leave, Miss.

She sighs and snatches the chalk out of your hand, throwing it on her desk.\n\n \n\n “Get out of my classroom, little girl. Mr. Stitch will be informed of your behaviour. Expect your grades to drop. Significantly.”\n\n \n\n She stares back at you, but says nothing more. After a moment, you turn and walk out of the classroom. You might have saved yourself from the effects of the school, but you wonder how badly Emily’s grades are going to be impacted.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You build up enough magical aura within your body to scan the room for the cause of the curse. You grow frustrated as your eyes move across the blackboard, to the desks, even to the maps on the wall. Nothing speaks to you.\n\n \n\n Then, there is a flicker of a glow from Prichards desk. Moving towards it, the aura becomes greater. Only when you are almost on top of it do you see the source.\n\n \n\n Prichard’s prized chalk emanates magical energy. Like your amulet, it feels warm as you hold your palm close to it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n\n Closing your eyes, you stretch your hand over the chalk.

The chalk pulsates with energy still, but you feel no warmth, nor heat when you move your palm over it. Wary, you run a single finger over it. It feels like an ordinary piece of chalk.\n\n \n\n Only the sight of magic illuminating from it gives any indication to you that the curse, in some form, is still active.\n\n \n “I cause this object with power beyond its power,” you say. “Unseen and unheard, its effects will be felt by none.”\n\n \n\n You open your eyes. Yellow energy seeps out of each end of the chalk, like pus flowing from a burst pimple. It seems to conjugate on Prichard’s desk, bubbling like acid eating away at the wood. Yet, as it evaporates, it leaves behind no trace of its presence.\n\n \n\n Then the chalk is just chalk, once again.\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You lean toward the small rectangular window in the geography room door, standing just out of the sight. From this angle, you can see most of the class - all boys - and the unmistakable form of Ms. Prichard at the front of the room, pointer in hand, standing beside the distorted world map you’ve seen before.\n\n \n\n \n Prichard appears to be in the middle of an impassioned lecture, but something is clearly off. The boys are shifting in their seats, whispering loudly, barely bothering to hide their reactions.\n\n \n\n You catch one of them smirking as they lean over to another and mimics her pointer gestures in exaggerated fashion. Another scribbles something in his notebook and holds it up. You can just make out the picture of Prichard dressed as Winston Churchill. There’s laughter.\n\n \n\n One by one, boys rise and approach the blackboard. Though not with reverence. Some are half-laughing before they even draw. One says something and the entire row behind him snorts. You can’t hear it, but you can guess the tone. Mocking, sarcastic, irreverent.\n\n \n\n Prichard snaps her pointer against the desk once, then again. But it’s like trying to hold back a wave with an umbrella.\n \n \n\n You watch for a few moments longer, but nothing abnormal happens. Whatever impact the curse had, you've nullified it. If you want to learn what's happening in the segregated boys lessons, you need the curse to be in-effect.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Even without sound, the room feels electric. Shoulders squared. Eyes alert. It doesn’t look like any geography class you’ve ever attended.\n\n \n\n You watch in growing discomfort as the boys begin to take turns approaching the blackboard. Each one draws lines with purpose. Confidence. Ruthlessness.\n\n \n\n One outlines a naval blockade with sweeping gestures. Another traces a path and jabs at it with the chalk, lips curled in something halfway between a smile and a snarl. You can’t hear the words, but you see one boy slap the desk, laughing. Another gestures with his fist closed, and several boys nod in approval.\n\n \n\n Ms. Prichard watches silently, head tilted. She doesn’t smile, but she doesn’t stop them either. Whatever this lesson is, it’s not just about borders. It’s about power. And conquest.\n\n \n\n \n As you scan over the room, you spot Dennis off to the side. He seems to be almost cowering, as if trying to shrink into his seat. Terrence is also leaning back, almost horizontal, his spindly body almost hidden beneath the top of his desk.\n\n As you scan over the room, you spot Dennis off to the side. He seems to be almost cowering, as if trying to shrink into his seat. Terrence, in contrast, is embracing the atmosphere, cheering as other students mark out diagrams on the blackboard.\n\n \n\n Whatever impact the lessons are having on the boys, it's not consistent. Whilst the majority of them have embraced Prichard's teachings, some are trying to avoid it. \n\n \n\n You’re still staring when Prichard suddenly turns. Her eyes sweep the room, then snap straight to the door.\n\n \n\n You duck out of sight. Your heart pounds. For a moment, you wait. But no one comes out. Still, you know what you saw. And more than that, you know what you felt.\n \n \n\n The impact of the lesson is definitely different on boys. But more curiously, the changes are different from person to person. You realise that if you’re going to find out the truth about how it's different, you’ll have to do more than peek through a window. You’ll have to get inside.\n\n \n\n How are you supposed to get inside a classroom full of boys? Not just to peek, but to experience what they’re being taught? To understand it?\n\n \n\n Around your neck, the amulet begins to tingle. A subtle vibration against your chest. As if answering the question.\n\n \n\n As a boy?\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n \n \n You take a careful step back from the door, away from the narrow strip of glass that looks into the classroom.\n\n \n \n “Excuse me,” says a voice behind you. “What exactly are you doing here?”\n\n \n\n You spin around to see Chantelle Marks stand in the corridor, arms folded neatly behind her back. Her school badge gleams in the overhead lights and she wears a pinched, disapproving expression. As if she’s been waiting for this moment all morning.\n\n \n\n “What are you doing here?” you ask defensively.\n\n \n\n “I’m a hall monitor,” she replies matter-of-factly. “When teachers suspect a student is wandering the halls without permission, they often ask me to investigate.” She tilts her head. “Just like they did with you.”\n\n \n\n You try to speak, but she cuts in quickly. “I’ll escort you to the nurse’s office,” she says. “Like you were supposed to go to. Unless you’d prefer I report you for truancy?”\n\n \n\n There’s no malice in her tone. Just rules. And her absolute belief in them.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You take a careful step back from the door, away from the narrow strip of glass that looks into the classroom.\n\n \n\n Considering what you'll have to do in order to discover how the lesson is impacting boys, you move away and back to the corridor.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Chantelle leads you down the corridor with precise steps, her hands clasped neatly behind her back. When you reach the Nurse’s Office, she knocks twice sharply, and waits.\n\n \n\n “Come,” says a voice from within. Even through the closed door, you can hear the cool authority behind the word. Chantelle opens the door and gestures for you to step inside.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

The map sprawls before you, waiting to be claimed.\n\n \n\n You drive lines through seas and borders with bold, sweeping strokes. Arrows pierce capitals, ports are circled and crossed out, coasts carved up into neat segments of occupation. Each mark feels good. As if the world itself bends beneath your hand.\n\n \n\n The room surges with noise. Desks thump. Whistles shrill. Someone calls out, “That’s it, Mannet! Show them!” Another shouts, “Take it all!”\n\n \n\n You can feel their energy feeding into you, pouring strength into every mark. Your chest swells and your thoughts sharpen. The invasion isn’t just imagined anymore. It’s inevitable. In your mind’s eye, ships cut across the sea, men storm beaches, flags rise over conquered cities.\n\n \n\n Behind you, the boys are on their feet, whooping and hollering as though you’d already won a war. The jeering that usually follows has turned to acclaim. For a moment, you are one of them. In fact, you think, grinning, you are leading them.\n\n \n\n Out of the corner of your eye, you see Prichard tilt her head. Her lips curl just enough to show satisfaction. She taps her pointer once against her palm, the sound a punctuation mark to your conquest. \"Nicely done, Master Mannet.\"\n\n \n\n The curse burns in your chest, no longer a whisper but a command. This is your right. The right of conquerors. The right of Charlton’s sons. The right of men.\n\n \n\n When you finally lower the chalk, the map is a mess of bold lines, arrows, and conquests. A vision of empire reborn. You turn back to the room, breath quick, pulse hammering. The boys cheer you still, the sound echoing in your bones.\n\n \n\n It feels good. Too good.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n The chalk rests in your hand, heavy as lead. The boys behind you yearn for conquest, jeering and thumping their desks, urging you to carve deeper. Prichard’s eyes gleam, waiting for you to press the assault.\n\n \n\n But you don’t.\n\n \n\n Instead, you draw your next line sideways, cutting across the arrows you’d already sketched. You sketch arcs that pull your forces back into a ring, defensive bulwarks protecting ports and supply routes. Not lines of invasion, but shields against them.\n\n \n\n The noise behind you falters.\n\n \n\n “What’s he doing?” someone mutters.\n\n \n\n “He’s retreating,” another sneers.\n\n \n\n A burst of laughter follows. “Mannet couldn’t conquer a sandwich!”\n\n \n\n You ignore them. The chalk flows steady in your grip. The marks aren’t bold thrusts of empire. They're lines of protection. Troops holding ground, not spilling out to take more.\n\n \n\n Prichard’s lips purse thin, her face unreadable but hard. “You think defence is the way of empire?” she asks, her voice clipped. “That our strength is to shield, not to strike?”\n\n \n\n You meet her gaze for a moment before turning back to the board. The curse pulses inside you, urging you to conquer. But you instead twist it. Not greed, but now duty. The strength to hold, to endure, to guard.\n\n \n\n The jeers sting, but you hold the chalk firm until the last line is drawn. When you lower your hand, the map isn't one of conquest. It's covered with shields and fortifications. Proof that not every man need be a predator.\n\n \n\n \"Take your seat, Mannet,\" Prichard curtly tells you. As you walk back to your desk you feel the curse lingering inside you. But it's now reshaped by your choice. Not hunger for territory, but resolve to protect. Not entitlement to lands, but vigilance of life.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n The scratching of chalk fades as the last boy takes his seat. The map is a battlefield now. Criss-crossed with arrows, lines, and half-erased claims of conquest.\n\n \n\n Ms. Prichard steps forward, pointer in hand. She taps it sharply against the board, the crack cutting through the murmurs. “Well. A spirited showing.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes sweep the room, pausing on you longer than the rest. “Geography is not a parlour game,\" she tells the class. \"It is the study of power. And power requires conviction. Some of you displayed it. Others still lack the backbone their Empire demands.”\n\n \n\n The boys mutter, some with pride, others with shame.\n\n \n\n The lines you carved are still burning in your mind. The boys’ jeers turned to cheers and the curse pulsates in your chest. You feel the swell of pride yourself.\n\n \n\n Prichard raps the pointer one last time against the board. “Dismissed.”\n\n \n\n The boys shove away from their desks, loud and boisterous, already mocking one another as they file out. You linger a moment longer, eyes drawn to the chalk-scarred map.\n\n \n\n And then it hits you. The sense of pride you're feeling is interlaced by something else. A carnal desire to claim and bend the world to your will.\n\n \n\n You watch the last boys exit, each wearing the same look of lust on their faces. What you're feeling isn't just limited to you.

    "text": "You nod and sit down, facing the other girls in the semi-circle. Britney grins broadly at you. Stacey offers you a polite smile. Reagan barely meets your eyes.\n\n \n\n “Firstly,” Christina begins. “Welcome to the cheerleader squad. That’s your uniform. Make sure you wear it for practice. I took the liberty of guessing your size.”\n\n \n\n You finger the material gently. It feels soft and new. \n\n \n\n “That, however,” Christina continues, “is just the beginning. You see, Emily, the cheerleader team has a certain role at Charlton. What I’m about to say might shock you, but there’s a reason we’re so selective. We have a responsibility to our school. Our community.”\n\n \n\n She looks around at the other cheerleaders with a smile, then turns back to you, holding out the palm of her hand. In it is an orb of yellow energy, floating in the air, casting a warm glow around it. Your body tingles. You recognise the sensation. \n\n \n\n “You see, Emily,” she repeats. “Magic is real.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n “What?” you stammer, putting all your efforts into sounding surprised.\n\n \n\n Christina grins. The orb rises up out of her hand and circles around the semi-circle. “Magic,” she repeats. “The stuff of fairy tales and legend. It’s true. All of it.”\n\n \n\n The orb of energy bobbles in the air for a moment longer, then shoots back into Christina’s palm disappearing. She smiles, waiting for you to speak.\n\n \n\n “What was that?” you say, again emphasising your ignorance. \n\n \n\n “A simple illumination spell,” Christina replies. “Just a small trick. I can teach you how to do it, if you like. I can teach you a lot of things.”\n\n \n\n “If she’s got the talent,” Reagan mutters under her breath. \n\n \n\n Christina shoots her a look. “She has,” she tells her. “I can feel it.”\n\n \n\n Then, Christina looks back at you, composing herself once more. “But first. Questions. You must have many.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You dramatically sigh. “I can’t say I’m surprised.” \n\n \n\n Christina’s eyebrow raises. “Oh?”\n\n \n\n “This school,” you tell her. “There’s a lot of strange things that happen here.”\n\n \n\n She studies you for a moment, then Christina looks around to her peers with a smile. “I told you she was smart.”\n\n \n\n “Dangerously so,” Reagan mutters.\n\n \n\n Christina closes her hand around the orb and it fizzles out of sight. “You’re right, of course. Magic pervades this school. In time, you’ll be able to see it. Use it. Manipulate it. We do far more than make a glow ball.”\n\n \n\n “You must have questions, though,” she continues. “We shall answer anything you ask. You’ve earned it.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Christina waits patiently for you to speak. The rest of the cheerleaders watch you with varying degrees of interest.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n Christina nods and looks around the group. “Then we should begin.”\n\n \n\n The statement elicits a quiet shriek from Britney, a smile from Stacey and a scowl from Reagan. \n\n \n\n “Now Emily,” Christina says slowly. “Once you join us, there’s no going back. You must make a solemn vow that you will do as we all agree, perform our duties to the school to the best of your magical affinity, and above all, tell not a soul about what you learn here. Is that understood?”\n\n \n\n “What if I don’t want to?” you say, testing where Christina’s boundaries lie.\n\n \n\n “We have our ways to keep you quiet,” she says. “Nothing violent. Just preying a thought or two from your mind. As an example - Britney, who sings Flaunt It?”\n\n \n\n “Oh I know this one! Lexi Star!” Britney squeals.\n\n \n\n Christina gives Britney a hard look. At first it looks like a disapproving stare, but then you feel it. Energy builds up in Christina and ebbs out towards Britney’s brain. \n\n \n\n “Again,” Christina commands. “Who sings Flaunt It?”\n\n \n\n Britney goes to speak, but pauses as her mouth opens. A confused look crosses her face. “I don’t know,” she says, quietly.\n\n \n\n Satisfied, Christina turns to you. “No harm, no foul. Quick and painfree. So Emily, you have a choice. Do you join us and learn how to perform magic, or do you return to your life none the wiser?”\n\n \n\n You glance at Britney, still struggling with confusion. Then turn back to Christina. If she tries that on you, will she notice that you can resist? And if not, will you forget what you’ve learned?\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n “Okay then,” you tell Christina. “I accept.”\n\n \n\n There is measured relief from all of the cheerleaders, except Reagan. Britney actually claps.\n\n \n\n \"Excellent,\" Christina says. \"To whet your appetite, let me show you how to send someone to sleep. And how to make them forget. There's a number of the quarterbacks that have experienced this one far too many times.\"\n\n \n\n \"Jake gets so drunk, he doesn't need a spell to black out,\" Britney comments. Christina shoots her a dark look.\n\n \n\n \"This will take some time,\" Christina tells you after gaining some composure. \"But it will be worth it. Trust me.\"\n\n \n \"I want to join,\" you tell Christina. \"I accept.\"\n\n \n\n There is measured relief from all of the cheerleaders, except Reagan. Britney actually claps.\n\n \n\n “Excellent,” Christina says. “To whet your appetite, let me show you how to send someone to sleep. And how to make them forget. There’s a number of the quarterbacks that have experienced this one far too many times.”\n\n \n\n “Jake gets so drunk, he doesn’t need a spell to black out,” Britney comments. Christina shoots her a dark look.\n\n \n\n “This will take some time,” Christina tells you after gaining some composure. “But it will be worth it. Trust me.”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n\n “I need some time to think about it,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n Christina’s smile drops away from her face. Her eyes flick to Reagan, who raises an eyebrow in response. Stacey looks off to the side, avoiding looking at you. And Britney gulps.\n\n \n\n “Very well,” Christina says, after a moment. “I’ll give you that leniency. Come back when you’ve considered whether to join us. But I must warn you, Emily. I’m taking a big risk here. If you tell anyone what we’ve discussed, it won’t just be your memories you lose.”\n\n \n\n You stare at Christina, then nod. “Thank you,” you say quietly. \n\n \n\n “We’ll be seeing you again,” Christina says as a farewell. “I hope.”\n\n \n\n Standing up from the mat, you make a hasty exit to the gym door, not daring to look back. Butterflies flutter in your stomach. You can’t tell if you’ve escaped a fate worse than death, or missed an opportunity to learn more than you could dream of.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Christina tells you to sit cross-legged on the mat and relax. You listen to her voice, telling you to breathe in, and breathe out.\n\n \n\n As you fall into a sway, you start to feel something inside of you. A brittle thing, sharp and spiky. It burns your lungs and you gasp for air.\n\n \n\n “You feel it, don’t you?” you hear Christina whisper. “Power. Inside of you.”\n\n \n\n As you concentrate on the feeling, the energy inside grows sharper and larger. Euphoria flows through you, connecting your sense to the ever-growing sensation of raw energy flowing through your body.\n\n \n\n “Now,” Christina says. “Open your eyes, and concentrate on Britney.”\n\n \n\n \"Me again?\" you hear Britney pipe up. \"No fair!\" It takes everything to not lose concentration as she’s shushed by the rest of the group.\n\n \n\n “Repeat these words”, you hear Christina say after a few moments. “*Fall asleep, and let your memories drift as you slumber.*”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Not wanting to reveal how much you already know, you decide to play along with Christina. You do as she tells you, sitting cross-legged on the mat.\n\n \n\n The technique is all-too familiar. Christina tells you to concentrate on your breathing, focusing on the feeling in your body. You quickly start to feel the energy building within you.\n\n \n\n Under Christina’s direction though, it feels different. Instead of a warm bath, it feels brittle and sharp. You feel as though you’re breathing hot and dense air, as if smoke was clogging your lungs. \n\n \n\n “You feel it, don’t you?” you hear Christina whisper. “Power. Inside of you.”\n\n \n\n As you concentrate on the feeling, the energy inside grows sharper and larger. Euphoria flows through you, connecting your sense to the ever-growing sensation of raw energy flowing through your body.\n\n \n\n “Now,” Christina says. “Open your eyes, and concentrate on Britney.”\n\n \n\n \"Me again?\" you hear Britney pipe up. \"No fair!\" It takes everything to not lose concentration as she’s shushed by the rest of the group.\n\n \n\n “Repeat these words”, you hear Christina say after a few moments. “*Fall asleep, and let your memories drift as you slumber.*”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You repeat the words that Christina told you, staring at Britney and her dejected face.\n\n \n\n Energy flashes out from you like a lance, striking Britney’s body. Her eyes grow into saucers before she collapses to the mat on her side.\n \n \n\n Stacey leaps up and rushes over to check on Britney. Christina looks at you, smiling with satisfaction. You note that even Reagan is watching you intently.\n\n \n\n After some moments, Stacey manages to bring Britney around. “Ow,” she winces. “My head.”\n\n \n\n Stacey helps her friend sit up. Britney looks around. When her eyes fall on you, she frowns.\n\n \n\n “Oh! Hey! Did Chrissie induct you into the squad yet? My brain is like a sieve. With holes. Large ones.”\n\n \n\n Christina glances back at you, still smiling. “Now that was quite impressive, Emily. You continue to impress me. That doesn’t happen often. Welcome to the coven.”\n\n \n\n Britney claps. Stacey gives you a smile. Even Reagan nods. Slightly.\n\n \n\n “There is one last thing,” Christina continues. “A final test. Based on what you just did, I’m sure it will be of no trouble to you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “What’s the final test?” you ask Christina.\n\n \n\n The head cheerleader purses her lips. “Does the name Liz Pleasant mean anything to you?”\n\n \n\n You try to hide your alarm. “She’s in my maths class. I think.”\n\n \n\n Christina brushes a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear and grimly smiles. “Perfect. She has been looking into things that she shouldn’t be looking into.”\n\n \n\n You wince, as Christina waits for a response. “Magic, you mean?”\n\n \n\n “Precisely. I don’t know how or where, but she knows more than is acceptable.” Christina glances in the direction of Stacey and Britney. “Perhaps some people have been talking about things in places where they shouldn’t?”\n\n \n\n Stacey and Britney both look down at their respective mats, averting their gazes.\n\n \n\n “I need her to forget anything she ever learned about magic,” Christina tells you. “Now that you know that spell, it should be simple for you. If she’s in your maths class, invite her over to study together. That should give you the privacy you need.”\n\n \n\n You look at Christina, then nod. She smiles, again with a cold edge to the mannerism.\n\n \n\n “I think that concludes this evening.” Christina turns to the rest of the group. “That will do for this evening.”\n\n \n\n The other cheerleaders nod and begin to put their mats away. As you stand up, Christina moves over to you.\n\n \n\n “When you’ve dealt with Liz, come back in the evening. I’ve got a lot to teach you.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "\"I've made sure that Liz won't be a problem,\" you tell them. “She doesn’t remember a thing.”\n\n \n\n The cheerleaders whisper mutters of approval between them. Christina smiles, giving Reagan a look. True to form, she scowls.\n\n \n\n “Then I formally greet you as a cheerleader for Charlton school,” Christina says, glancing at Reagan. “Unless there are no objections.”\n\n \n\n Reagan says nothing. The others all burst out in cheers. \n\n \n\n “You can now take your uniform,” Christina tells you. “Wear it for school if you like, to make sure that everyone knows you’re now one of us. And take advantage of the special perks of being a cheerleader. If you have things to do outside of school in the afternoon, you’ll find the teachers won’t stop you leaving. Mr. Stitch gives his exceptional students special privileges, which includes our squad. And your grades won’t suffer, either.”\n\n \n\n “You should come with us to the pool at the Country Club one afternoon, Em!” Britney says excitedly. “There’s a lot of hot boys to watch!”\n\n \n\n Christina gives you a look, but her smile is light and warm. “I personally spend a lot of my time at my father’s store. If you want to indulge in a little window shopping, drop by one afternoon. Or, if you aren't quite brave enough to leave school during the day, I'll be there Saturday and Sunday mornings too.”\n\n \n\n “Has he got new stock yet, Chrissie?” Stacey asks.\n\n \n\n “Not anything that would fit your lanky body,” Britney sniggers.\n\n \n\n With the patience of a mother hen, Christina waits for their bickering to stop. She then turns back to you. “Now. On to our duties. The curses. Or, to use the magical name. Let’s talk about Wards.”\n\n <>\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Now listen carefully, Emily,” Christina begins. “This is very important. If you don’t understand or something isn’t clear, please let me know. I want you to get this right.”\n\n \n\n “Wards are what we call the magic we practise at Charlton. They are spells cast on everyday things, designed to guide and shape our friends and fellow students. With a little nudge here and there, everyone becomes the best versions of themselves. It’s almost gratifying to watch, like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.”\n\n \n\n “We maintain these spells in the kitchen, the Maths room, Geography Room, Business Studies, Biology class, and of course, in this gymnasium. Now that you’ve been awakened to your magical affinity, you should be able to sense them. \n\n \n\n “Your job will be to review them regularly, and ensure none of them has been tampered with. With the likes of Elizabeth prowling around, I wouldn’t be surprised to find that some have been compromised.”\n\n \n\n You glance around the room, noticing that the other cheerleaders are listening aptly to their leader. “How do you get into some of those places?”\n\n \n\n “Good question,” Christina says, smirking. “Unfortunately we have to be discreet. There are some teachers at Charlton who aren’t privy to our activities. You’ll have to use your wits, I’m afraid. Although, we can help out where we can.”\n\n \n\n She turns to Stacey and Britney, giving them an arched eyebrow. “Have you still got the key to the kitchen?”\n\n \n\n \n \n The pair look at each other, sheepishly. They both lower their eyes to the floor. \n\n \n\n “Britney lost it,” Stacey mutters.\n\n \n\n “I did not! You didn’t give it to me!”\n\n \n\n Christina sighs, grimacing. The facade of her composed demeanour slips just for a moment. “Clutzes! The both of you.”\n\n \n\n She turns back to you, a forced smile reappearing. “Like I said, you’ll need to show some initiative. Lord knows someone has to.”\n \n \n The pair look at each other, accusingly. Then Britney seems to remember. “Oh yes! I have it!” She scrambles around for her school bag and pulls out the kitchen key, handing it to you.\n \n \n \n\n “How do I modify the curses?” you ask Christina, before quickly adding: “If something’s been changed.”\n\n \n\n “Simple,” she replies. “It’s time for your next lesson. I’m going to teach you how to perform Ward.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n Not wishing to show your hand, you indulge Christina’s attempts to train you, in spite of already knowing the spell she’s about to teach.\n\n Once again, you sit cross-legged on the mat. Christina tells you to focus on the power within you. “Feel it prickling inside your body.”\n\n \n\n You close your eyes, sensing the magical energies swelling inside of you. You feel its power, ready to obey your command.\n\n \n\n “Reach out,” you hear Christina say. “Look for that feeling outside your body. In Stacey. In Britney. In Reagan. In me.”\n\n \n\n You sense the power in all of them. Britney’s power is meagre, Stacey is not far ahead of her. Reagan feels prickly and spiky, with a surge of raw magic ricocheting inside her. Christina is the most powerful of the lot. Perhaps even more than you.\n\n \n\n “Turn your attention to the gym,” Christina’s voice tells you. “The ropes. Benches. Monkey bars.”\n\n \n\n Your mind’s eye wanders across the gym, sensing the magic infused within the gym equipment. Like lights in a dark room, they all stand out to you.\n\n \n\n “Excellent,” Christina purrs. “Pick one. Focus on it.”\n\n \n\n You zero in on one of the yoga balls, recalling your first trip to the gym. It radiates power. You feel its heat within it. \n\n \n\n “Repeat after me,” Christina says. “I curse this object with power beyond its power. Unseen and unheard, its effects will be felt by all except us.”\n\n \n\n You brace yourself, ready to say the words.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n \n\n You repeat Christina’s words. You feel the energies within the ball crack and splitter. \n\n \n\n “Push!” Christina tells you.\n\n \n\n Like a window shattering, the magic within the ball erupts into a thousand fragments. They hang in the air, flickering like fairy lights, floating and unmoving. \n\n \n\n “Now,” Christina instructs you. “Force them together.”\n\n \n\n With a gentle thought, you find you can direct the embers to move. If you shattered the glass before, your mind now sweeps the fragments up together. As they meet each other, they bond and reform.\n\n \n\n You push them towards the yoga ball and they seep into it, sticking to it like treacle. Within moments, the ball shines to you as brightly as before, the Ward restored.\n\n \n\n Satisfied, you open your eyes. Christina is smiling proudly back at you.\n\n \n\n “See,” she comments. “Simple. You should find that it’s easier to sense what is magic and what is not now.”\n\n \n\n You look around the gym, noticing the magical embers flowing off almost every piece of equipment. “It’s one of our more complex works,” you hear Christina say.\n\n \n\n You blink yourself, refocusing on reality. The other cheerleaders look at you with admiration. Except Reagan. But instead of scowling, she has now taken to just watching you.\n\n \n\n “That should be enough for now,” Christina says. “Go take a look at the other Wards around the school. Let me know if you find anything irregular. And don’t forget - department store. Afternoons.”\n\n \n\n You nod, taking the hint that the meeting is over. The other girls begin to drag their mats to the side of the gym. Christina gives you a friendly smile, and you walk out the door.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "You hand over the note that you penned to Coach Beach. He snatches it up, unfolds it, and reads it carefully. Once he’s done, his eyes look up over the note at you, eyeing you.\n\n \n\n “Cramps, eh?” He sighs. “A poor excuse to duck out of some exercise, but I’ve been told that I need to make allowances for your ladies.\"\n\n \n\n Behind you, one of the kids in uniform sniggers. He falls silent quickly when Beach gives him a dark look.\n\n \n\n “Alright, Phillips. You’ve got a pass. Get over in the sin bin. The rest of you, let’s see if your notes are as convincing.”\n\n \n\n You stand up from the bench and move up to the top seat on the rafters in the corner. A few other students join you after Beach verifies their own notes. You smile politely, but they make no efforts to respond. Only Chester, a kid with glazed eyes, meets your stare as Beach reluctantly lets him sit out.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n \n Beach walks over to the centre of the gym. “Alright kids,” he bellows. “Weatherman says it’s going to drizzle today. And whilst I think you all can survive a bit of rain, I’ve been told that some of you have weak immune systems. I don’t need your moms on the phone yelling at me for getting you sick.”\n\n \n\n You notice Beach looks up to the bleachers. For a moment, you think he’s looking at you. But his eyes drift to Chester beside you. The boy gazes vacantly down into the floor, unaware he’s being watched.\n\n \n\n “So same old, same old,” Beach says, returning his attention to the class. “Inside activities. Boys with boys. Girls with girls. Pair off into fives and go stand by one of the obstacles on the course. Only rule - don’t come last.”\n\n \n\n The students organise themselves into groups - either groups of girls, or groups of boys. As they do so, from the side of your eye you catch Chester staring at you.\n\n \n\n “Your hair is shining,” he tells you. “It’s glowing yellow.”\n\n \n\n The shriek of Beach’s whistle snaps your gaze back to the gym, as the squeaking and sliding of fifty pairs of sneakers fills the air.\n\n \n “Alright, settle down!\" Beach bellows from the centre of the room. He gestures to the drizzle hitting the full length windows and tells the class that they’ll be inside again today.\n\n \n\n “Hop to it, then,” he says. “Get in your groups and try to conjure up at least a little enthusiasm. Loser still gets the booby prize.”\n\n \n\n Next to you, Chester stretches, then stares up, enraptured by the hanging halogen lamps. “It wriggles.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n The students throw themselves around the gym with enthusiasm, leaping through exercise after exercise. The smell of sweat soon fills the air.\n\n \n\n “It’s hot,” you hear Chester say to another student sitting out. His words are soft and slow. “Like a dry heat.”\n\n \n\n \"What are you talking about, Chester?\" the kid replies. “It’s freezing in here.”\n\n \n\n Chester breaks into a sloppy slide, looking back to the gym. “Never freezes in the jungle,” he mutters.\n\n \n\n Out on the gym floor, the class continues. You see the students perspiring from the activity. Sweat patches are forming on polo shirts. Hair turns wet and slick. \n\n \n\n The groups of boys watch the girls exercise in-between activities. Some of the bolder ones whoop and cheer, casting lecherous looks towards the girls.\n\n \n\n \n However, the response seems to surprise them. Instead of encouraging it, the girls scowl and roll their eyes. One even calls them out. “Keep your eyes off me, you perv.”\n\n \n\n The knockbacks appear to put the boys on the back foot. Uncharacteristically for Charlton, they seem unsure of themselves. They begin to fumble and trip as they exercise. By the end of the lesson, the only cheers and hollers are coming from the women, applauding each other's efforts.\n\n \n\n \n The girls appear to respond to it. A number of them throw coy smiles back at the comments. Stretches that spread legs and arch backs are held longer than is needed. A number of flips and jumps purposefully are made to flash a glimpse of underwear to the audience. As if they are performing to the crowd.\n\n \n\n You take a breath, smelling the body odour lingering in the gym. Fortunately, your mind is clear. Nothing about the increasing catcalls and whistles has any impact on you.\n\n \n\n The girls increasingly respond to them as they perform more exercises. You watch them pant and gasp for air, as they put more effort into their movements and exercise. Only those who are struggling with physical activity seem to be ignoring the crowd.\n\n \n\n \n As the girls flip and leap through the activities, they appear to respond enthusiastically to the boys' commentary. The more athletic they are, the more they seem to be performing to the crowd. A vicious circle, the boys in turn give them more attention.\n\n \n\n \n Free from worrying about exercise, you focus your inner powers and concentrate on the gym. You see the room through your mind’s eye, trying to sense what is causing their behaviour.\n\n \n\n The idle chatter from the excluded students constantly threatens to distract you, but you can see whispers of magic flowing from the gym equipment, drifting into the bodies of the students as they breathe heavily.\n\n \n\n It’s the equipment, you think. It’s giving off some sort of magical energy that the students are breathing in.\n\n \n\n \n You can't be certain what's causing it, but you are certain it's unnatural. You note that in spite of being in the gym, whatever magic at play here has no effect on you.\n\n \n \n \n The students enthusiastically start exercising, moving from one activity to the next. Sweat fills the air. Students begin to perspire and take deep breaths from the activity.\n\n \n\n The male students focus their attention on the girls in-between their own exercising. Sounds of whoops and cheers accompany grins and leering looks.\n\n \n\n \n The response is muted. Girls scowl and roll their eyes. “You’re a runt,” one girl calls out as a boy watches her bend over to stretch. The change in tone unnerves the boys. Some of them start to make mistakes and stumble. By the end, they finish in silence.\n\n \n\n \n The girls respond, welcomingly. They throw coy smiles back and linger on stretches that call attention to their bodies. They grin as they are applauded, playing to the audience. For them, the curse is still very much a reality.\n\n \n\n \n The girls increasingly respond to them as they perform more exercises. You watch them pant and gasp for air, as they put more effort into their movements and exercise. Only those who are struggling with physical activity seem to be ignoring the crowd.\n\n \n Focusing on the magic in the air around you, you think you know why. You see the room through your mind’s eye, trying to sense what is causing their behaviour.\n\n \n\n The idle chatter from the excluded students constantly threatens to distract you, but you can see whispers of magic flowing from the gym equipment, drifting into the bodies of the students as they breathe heavily.\n\n \n\n It’s the equipment, you think. It’s giving off some sort of magical energy that the students are breathing in.\n\n \n\n \n It dawns on you that you too feel nothing other than mild annoyance towards the guys. Something is at play here, something you just can't quite see. But you are certain it has to be magical.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n Beach blows his whistle for a final time and the students take a seat on the respective sides of the gym. Girls on one side. Boys on the other.\n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” Beach says from the centre of the gym. “At least from some of you. But we all know what happens to those who don’t perform. Don’t we, boys?”\n\n \n\n There is a surprising lack of enthusiasm from the male side of the gymnasium. After struggling with the activities today, the boys seem unsure of themselves. \n\n He glances back at the boys' side of the gym. They whoop and holler at his beckon. They seem confident that none of them will end up last.\n\n \n\n “So,” Beach says, turning back to your side of the room. “Who’s today’s recipient of my favourite booby prize? Who is spending tonight cleaning up the sweat from my precious gym floor?\" His eyes roam across the girls' faces.\n\n \n\n \"Miss Oats,\" Beach cries out. \"Congratulations!\"\n\n \n\n \n There is a smattering of applause from the boys' side, but you see the signs of relief in some of the faces. The girls, by contrast, are muttering amongst themselves, each peppered with frowns and confusion. Objectively, some of the boys did worse today.\n\n \n\n Beach seems unnerved by the response. “Get to the showers, then,” he mutters. “Dismissed.”\n\n \n\n Everyone begins to rush out, ready to shower and go home. You glance at Heather, sitting alone on the bench, shocked.\n\n \n He glances back at the boys' side of the gym. They whoop and holler at his beckon. They seem confident that none of them will end up last.\n\n \n\n The gym teacher turns back to the class. “Get to the showers. Show’s over!”\n\n \n\n Everyone begins to rush out, ready to shower and go home. You glance at Heather as you walk by, but she stares down into the dirty floor.\n\n \n \n The whistle blows and the students each take a seat. “Good work,” Beach says, standing in the centre. “But who gets to mop up the sweat from my gym today?\"\n\n \n\n There is a surprising lack of enthusiasm from the male side of the gymnasium.

    "text": "“Alright kids,” you hear Beach bellow. Like everyone else, you turn to look at him in the centre of the gym, as if it was a stage. “Weatherman says it’s going to drizzle today. And whilst I think you all can survive a bit of rain, I’ve been told that some of you have weak immune systems. I don’t need your moms on the phone yelling at me for getting you sick.”\n\n \n\n “So same old, same old. Inside activities. Boys with boys. Girls with girls. Pair off into fives and go stand by one of the obstacles on the course. Only rule - don’t come last.”\n\n \n\n You turn around and are accepted into a group forming nearby. Other students aren’t so lucky, but within a minute everyone is separated into squads. The organiser of your group gestures for you to move over to the balance beam. Like everything in here, it smells like a gym sock. Removing the curse hasn't stopped the smell from threatening to overpower you.\n\n \n\n Beach’s whistle shrieks and instantly the sounds of fifty sneakers squeaking and sliding fills the air. You clamber up on to equipment, energised by the noise, and move as fast as you can over the beam. It’s enough to remind you that this body is still new to you, with your centre of gravity shifted away from what you are used to.\n\n \n\n “Careful, Phillips,” you hear Beach say as he passes by. “You won’t find a knight in shining armour to catch you in here.”\n\n \n\n Ignoring him, you make it to the other side. The other girls follow suit and quickly you’re moving around to the next course. So quick, in fact, that the group of boys in front of you hasn’t finished on the vaulting boxes.\n\n \n\n You take deep breaths as you feel your heart beating. The natural endorphins from exercise start to circulate through your body. There is something rewarding about the class, especially as you are free of any adverse effects from the equipment. The body odour of teenage boys' is still repellant, but you find some degree of enjoyment in the activity.\n\n \n\n The last boy in the group in front of you vaults over the box and looks back at you, indicating you’re free to go.\n \n \n “Alright, settle down!” Beach bellows from the centre of the room. He gestures to the drizzle hitting the exterior of the full length windows and tells the group with some disappointment that you’ll again be spending the lesson inside today. \n\n \n\n “Hop to it, then,” he tells the class. “Get in your groups and try to conjure up at least a little enthusiasm. Loser still gets the booby prize.”\n\n \n\n You stand and form your regular group, moving over to the Balance Beam that permeates with dust and sweat. Coach Beach blows his whistle and you clamber up one end of the beam, running across it with a sense of confidence that you’ve done this before.\n\n \n\n The rest of your group does the same and quickly you’re waiting for the group in front of you to finish using the Vaulting Box. Blood pumps through your veins and you feel invigorated by the rush of exercise. With the curse no longer in effect, the offensiveness of stale body odour is only more present to your senses. \n\n \n\n The last boy in the group in front finishes, nodding that you are free to go.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n <> \n \n \n \n “Alright kids,” you hear Beach bellow.

Your nimble body and quick feet move quickly and suddenly you’re instinctively throwing your hands on top of the box.\n\n \n\n The world flips on its axis as you turn upside down. Legs are above your body, back kicking them high vertically into the air. \n\n \n\n With a gentle thud, you feel your feet touch down on a mat. It takes a second for you to get your bearings. You are standing on the other side of the vault box, feet firmly on the floor. \n\n \n\n As you regain your breath, there is some gentle applause from nearby students. Even Coach Beach is looking at you from beside the mat, a hint of surprise on his face.\n\n \n\n “Nice work, Phillips,” he murmurs. “Make a cheerleader out of you, yet. Might want to adjust yourself back there, though.”\n\n \n\n You follow his eyeline and glance over your shoulder down your back. Gravity has had its way with your skirt. The back is now bunched up around your waist, showing your gym briefs to the rows of onlooking boys behind you.\n\n \n\n Upon seeing you notice, they burst out laughing. You even get a few wolf whistles.\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath, panting from the exertion. The smell of cheap boys' deodorant fills your nostrils. It serves as a reminder of the curse you've removed, which would have made you smile at the attention.\n\n \n\n Instead, you brush down your skirt and throw them a dark look. As you regain your breath, you take solace that whilst you may feel on display, you no longer have magic making you indulge it.\n \n \n You rush forward and clear the distance between you and the box, then push your hands forward and throw yourself up into the air. The thrill of your agility flutters inside your body as you turn upside down, your nimble legs thrust up high in the air. \n\n \n\n You land with a gentle thud on the other side, hearing a few whoops and whistles from behind you. Coach Beach even gives you an appreciative grin.\n\n \n\n You look back at him, not returning his smile. Instead, you check your clothing to make sure it's all in the right place. The attention soon diverts elsewhere and, free from the curse in the gym, you are all the more glad for it.\n \n \n \n \n \n You grin and rush forward towards the vaulting box. Your nimble body and quick feet move quickly and suddenly you’re instinctively throwing your hands on top of the box.\n\n \n\n The world flips on its axis as you turn upside down. Legs are above your body, back kicking them high vertically into the air. \n\n \n\n With a gentle thud, you feel your feet touch down on a mat. It takes a second for you to get your bearings. You are standing on the other side of the vault box, arms stretched out, smiling broadly, feet firmly on the floor. \n\n \n\n As you regain your breath, there is some gentle applause from nearby students. Even Coach Beach is looking at you from beside the mat, a hint of surprise on his face.\n\n \n\n “Nice work, Phillips,” he murmurs. “Make a cheerleader out of you, yet.

You have to admit, there’s something pleasant about it.\n\n \n\n Looking, to the crowd. You give them a coy smile. “Oops,” you say to them.\n\n \n\n It’s enough for them to start laughing again. You watch them over your shoulder, lips open, as you pose there in your exposed underwear. Predatory smiles play out on their faces looking at you. \n\n \n\n You bite your lip and give them a final look, then brush your skirt down. Finally getting your breath from the exercise, you know you have every eye on the gym on you.\n\n \n\n At least the ones belonging to the boys, anyway.\n \n \n You rush forward and clear the distance between you and the box, then push your hands forward and throw yourself up into the air. The thrill of your agility flutters inside your body as you turn upside down, your nimble legs thrust up high in the air. \n\n \n\n You land with a gentle thud on the other side, stretching your hands out and smiling, as you gasp for air. You smile as you hear whoops and whistles from the boys behind you. Even Coach Beach flashes you an appreciative grin. \n\n \n\n You look back over your shoulder at your audience and reach down without breaking eye contact, checking your skirt. It has only ridden up slightly, but you make it a big deal, even pulling it up a bit more momentarily to adjust it.\n\n \n\n A brief flash is enough to get another round of applause out of them. You give them all a grin, taking deep breaths, basking in the attention they are giving you.\n\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n You run forward towards the vaulting box. Your light body can move quickly and almost too soon you’re right in front of the box. Instinctively you stretch your hands out and push them down against the top of the box.\n\n \n\n You feel your body lift off the floor, arching on to its side as the world spins and your legs sweep up over the equipment. \n\n \n\n A moment later you land, feeling your sneakers touch down on the soft gym mat on the other side of the vaulting box. \n\n \n\n You take a deep breath, both through exertion and relief that you cleared the box. The next girl in your group smiles back at you encouragingly as she readies her own attempt.\n\n \n\n “Move, Phillips,” you hear Beach tell you from nearby. “There’s no applause coming, and you’re holding up the line.”\n\n \n\n You look at him and nod, moving to the side of the gym mat. The other girls in your group repeat the exercise, joining you once they too have vaulted. \n\n \n\n You take the time to regain your breath, panting a little from the activity. Without the curse active, you make no attempt to stifle your breathing. You smell the cheap deodorant hanging in the air. \n\n \n\n A boy walks by, flashing you a smile. You can't help but wince as his body odour hits your nostrils. \n\n \n\n Looking dejected, he turns away and walks on.\n\n \n You run forward and instinctively stretch your hands out when you reach the box, lifting your body off the floor. You pivot your body on its side, pulling your legs up and over, landing cleanly on the other side of the equipment. \n\n \n\n Taking a deep breath, you feel energised at a successful vault. You give a grin back to your group as the next girl braces herself to follow and move to the side of the mat. \n\n \n\n You watch the rest of your group repeat your performance, smelling the stench of nearby boys as you regain your breath. The group in front strain their muscles as they exercise. Without the curse, the only effect of smells and sights are to offend your sense of smell.\n\n \n \n \n \n You run forward towards the vaulting box. Your light body can move quickly and almost too soon you’re right in front of the box. Instinctively you stretch your hands out and push them down against the top of the box.\n\n \n\n You feel your body lift off the floor, arching on to its side as the world spins and your legs sweep up over the equipment. \n\n \n\n A moment later you land, feeling your sneakers touch down on the soft gym mat on the other side of the vaulting box. \n\n \n\n You take a deep breath, both through exertion and relief that you cleared the box.

The other girls in your group repeat the exercise, joining you once they too have vaulted. \n\n \n\n You take the time to regain your breath, panting a little from the activity. You can smell the boys nearby, at best their cheap deodorant wafting into your nostrils. A few of them haven’t even bothered with that to mask their body odour. \n\n \n\n It’s not as offensive as you first thought. Maybe you’re just growing used to it, but it doesn’t seem nearly as repugnant as it did a few minutes ago. \n\n \n\n Your attention drifts away to look at the boys performing the exercises in front of your group. Pulling themselves across monkey bars, flexing their muscles, faces covered in perspiration. You find it curious. You’ve never really noticed how defined a boys' arms can be, before.\n\n \n\n When one even walks by you, you take in his body scent as he passes by. He looks at you, eyes flicking up and down your body. He grins. \n\n \n\n Without meaning to, you grin back. Was he checking you out?\n\n \n You run forward and instinctively stretch your hands out when you reach the box, lifting your body off the floor. You pivot your body on its side, pulling your legs up and over, landing cleanly on the other side of the equipment. \n\n \n\n Taking a deep breath, you feel energised at a successful vault. You give a grin back to your group as the next girl braces herself to follow and move to the side of the mat. \n\n \n\n You watch the rest of your group repeat your performance, smelling the musk of the boys nearby as you regain your breath. The smell slowly becomes bearable. You look over at the group in-front, watching the boys flex their muscles with curiosity. You can’t help but smile back as a few of them return your gaze. Only then do you realise that you are indeed actually gazing. \n\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n \n \n \n With little enthusiasm, you jog over to the vaulting box. You put your hands on top of it, and slowly pull yourself up. Sitting on the top of the box, you swing your legs over, still keeping them together, and drop on to the other side.\n\n \n\n You catch Beach looking at you as you walk casually across the mats. “You okay, Phillips? Maybe take it even easier. We wouldn’t want you breaking a nail.”\n\n \n\n You hold yourself back from responding. There are sniggers behind you from the group in front of yours. The boys give you derisive looks.\n\n \n\n You catch a whiff of them as they move past you towards the next activity. One cracks a joke, but you pay it little attention. *After all, they stink.*\n\n \n\n Soon the rest of your group catches up to you. As you wait patiently for the group of boys to be done with the next equipment, the organiser of your group leans into you and whispers quietly. “Careful. You’re going to end up being kept back after school.” \n\n \n\n You consider for a moment that now the curse in the gym doesn't impact you, exercising more vigorously wouldn't have any effect. That's if you wanted to, of course.\n\n \n You leisurely jog over to the box, pulling yourself on to it and shuffling your legs over the top. You drop down on the other side, no danger of breaking a sweat. \n\n \n\n The boys in the group in front of you watch, sniggering. You don’t react, taking solace in how bad they smell. \n\n \n\n What does concern you is the look the rest of your group gives you when they catch up to you. “Try harder!” one of them cautiously whispers. “You’re going to get held back!”\n\n \n\n You consider for a moment that now the curse in the gym doesn't impact you, exercising more vigorously wouldn't have any effect.

A set of rusted monkey bars stretches across the width of the gym. You wonder how old they are and how many students have swung across them over the years.\n\n \n\n You watch the group of boys in front of you perform the exercise. A number of them slip, losing their grip. You can see the sweat glisten on the bars from here. \n\n \n\n \n You take a deep breath, readying yourself The smell of boys' sweat does nothing for you. \n\n \n\n As you rest, you look around the gym at the other students. The boys waiting to start an exercise watch the girls stretch and leap with lustful glee. A few of them call out and whistle as they perform. \n\n \n\n However, the response seems to surprise them. Instead of encouraging it, the girls scowl and roll their eyes. One even calls them out. “Keep your eyes off me, you perv.”\n\n \n\n It’s enough to cast the boys to falter. You notice that as the retorts to their unwanted attention keeps coming, they grow sullen and silent. Some start making mistakes, slipping on the exercise equipment. You catch Beach looking at them, confused.\n\n \n\n You prepare for the next exercise.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n <>\n \n\n \n You take a deep breath, readying yourself.

You briefly find yourself wondering what that sweat smells like…\n\n \n\n As you rest, you look around the gym at the other students. The boys waiting to start an exercise watch the girls stretch and leap with lustful glee. A few of them call out and whistle as they perform.\n\n \n\n The more athletic girls appear to respond warmly to the catcalls, posing after they complete exercises and grinning between pants. You find yourself pouting.\n\n \n\n Are you envious of the attention they are getting?\n\n \n\n You prepare for the next exercise.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n <>\n \n\n \n \n \n Once the last boy drops down at the other side, you sprint over to the equipment and throw yourself up onto the bar. The rigorous activity acts as a deterrent to thinking, almost like an exorcism of the mental cobwebs creeping over your brain. \n\n \n\n You reach out rung by rung, swinging your legs high in the air. You push yourself to the limit, feeling better. Fitter. Stronger.\n\n \n\n The sweat on the bars isn't pleasant, but you are free from the grasp of magic in the gym. You sense nothing from the equipment, nor mats, nor ropes and exercise gear.\n\n \n\n You see Coach Beach staring at you, a curious look on his face. Burying the thoughts, you focus on putting in as much energy as you can.\n\n \n\n Once you've completed the monkey bars, you move to the next set of equipment. And then the next. Pushing yourself to the limit. A number of students applaud your efforts. A few of them whistle and cheer.\n\n \n\n You ignore the stare and lustful grins though. By the end of the lesson, though exhausted, you are content with what you managed to achieve.\n\n \n \n\n Dismissing any lingering thoughts, you sprint over to the monkey bars when the last boy in the group ahead completes his task. You move across the rungs, pushing yourself as fast as you can.\n \n \n\n Out of the corner of your eye you notice the boys watching, but without the enticing magic you keep your mind focused on the lesson. In a flash you slink across the bars and drop down at the far side.\n\n \n\n Moving on, you continue to push your body. On occasion you notice that your enthusiasm comes close to causing a wardrobe accident, but you don't care. The boys may be watching you, but their stares are barely a second thought.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Once the last boy drops down at the other side, you sprint over to the equipment and throw yourself up onto the bar. The rigorous activity acts as a deterrent to thinking, almost like an exorcism of the mental cobwebs creeping over your brain.\n\n \n\n You reach out rung by rung, swinging your legs high in the air. You push yourself to the limit, feeling better. Fitter. Stronger.\n\n \n\n And you know the boys keep watching your athletic body bend and stretch as you throw yourself around.\n\n \n\n You look over to the group in front, watching you as your legs swing wide and free. You grin, dropping down after swinging from the last bar.\n\n \n\n Inside your brain, however, a voice of panic is crying out. As you rest for a second, as you breathe deeply, smelling the alluring scents of boys' perspiration and body odour. Then you see it. Magical embers flowing from the gym equipment, drifting into your body as you breathe. It’s not just one thing in the gym that’s cursed, you think. It’s everything.\n\n Why am I thinking like this, you hear inside your mind. You take in another quick gasp of air, smelling the intoxicating smells of boys' deodorant and sweat. Then it registers. You can almost see the magical embers radiating out from the gym equipment, drifting into your nostrils as you breathe. Whatever is causing you to feel like this, you’re sure that’s part of it.\n\n Something doesn’t sit right with you, but the thought always seems just out of reach. You are certain there's magic at play though. There has to be.\n\n \n \n\n You see Coach Beach staring and you bury your thoughts back down in your mind. Instead, you keep putting in as much energy as you can, despite the underlying worry inside your brain. \n\n \n\n Moving on to the next set of equipment, you continue pushing your body to its limit, seemingly throwing caution to the wind as you let your skirt ride up and your polo shirt to drop down. Yet some part of you enjoys it. Especially the eyes that increasingly move from what they are doing, and focus on you.\n\n \n\n By the end, you are receiving cheers and whistles every time you perform. And what a performance you make it. You grin with delight as you notice guys watching. More foreign to you, in-between exercises you’re drawn to watch them too.\n\n \n Dismissing any lingering thoughts, you sprint over to the monkey bars when the last boy in the group ahead completes his task. You move across the rungs, pushing yourself as fast as you can.\n\n \n\n You flash a grin to the boys, watching you. You feel a thrill as you move, feeling their eyes lingering on your body as you twist and slink across the bars and drop down at the end. You briefly wonder what they’re thinking…\n\n \n\n Inside your brain, however, a voice of panic is crying out. As you rest for a second, as you breathe deeply, smelling the alluring scents of boys' perspiration and body odour. Then you see it. Magical embers flowing from the gym equipment, drifting into your body as you breathe. It’s not just one thing in the gym that’s cursed, you think. It’s everything.\n\n Why am I thinking like this, you hear inside your mind. You take in another quick gasp of air, smelling the intoxicating smells of boys' deodorant and sweat. Then it registers.

Whatever is causing you to feel like this, you’re sure that’s part of it.\n\n Something doesn’t sit right with you, but the thought always seems just out of reach. You are certain there's magic at play though. There has to be.\n\n \n \n\n Moving on to the next exercise, you continue to push your body, uncaring of how much your rigorous energy is flaunting your body. Some part of you enjoys being on display. Having the attention and admiration of the class. The boys regularly stop to watch you. And in-between exercises, you watch them too.\n\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You step up to the monkey bars as the last boy swings down from the last rung. He glances back at you. You smile back, politely.\n\n \n\n Then it’s your turn. You reach up and pull yourself off the floor. You feel your skirt threatening to ride up as your legs rise, so you’re careful not to overexert yourself as you move across the equipment. As you feel your arms straining, you gasp for precious oxygen to power your body, smelling the odour of the boy that came before.\n\n \n\n You try not to look, but you can feel eyes watching you. For a brief moment you catch the sight of one of the boys from the group in front, staring at your parted legs as you swing from bar to bar.\n\n \n\n He’s trying to catch a glimpse of my briefs, you think. You shoot him a dirty stare and he quickly looks to the floor, embarrassed.\n\n \n\n You ponder for a brief moment that thanks to the curses the boys may have grown used to the girls liking the attention. \n\n \n\n Dropping down from the last bar, you grin thinly. Your mind is clear. You can focus on the lesson. And not on the boys. \n\n \n\n You see Coach Beach staring and you dismiss the thoughts to avoid drawing more attention to yourself. Instead, you focus on getting through the lesson. When your group moves on to the next one, you try not to exert yourself anymore than is necessary to finish.\n\n \n\n By the end, you’ve done enough that you feel you have at least projected the image of hard-work and enthusiasm. You finish short-of-breath, breathing heavily in spite of the scent of sweaty teenagers. \n\n \n\n Looking around, you see the boy from earlier looking at you. When you catch his eyeline, he looks away again, blushing.\n\n \n \n\n The last boy in front swings down from the bars and looks back at you to signal you can begin. You ignore him and swing forward, grabbing the first bar.\n\n \n\n Your arms strain as you move across the bars and you gasp for oxygen to help, trying to avoid taking a whiff of the sweat on the equipment. You glance forward and see the boy watching you, staring at your legs swinging in the air.\n\n \n\n Free from the curses, your mind is clear. Focusing on getting through the exercise, you complete the activity. When your group moves on, you do enough to complete the lesson.\n\n \n\n By the end, you feel you have put in enough effort to at least pass. You finish short-of-breath, happy to be free to breath easily and without concern.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n You step up to the monkey bars as the last boy swings down from the last rung. He glances back at you. You smile.\n\n \n\n Then it’s your turn. You reach up and pull yourself off the floor. You feel your skirt threatening to ride up as your legs rise, so you’re careful not to overexert yourself as you move across the equipment. As you feel your arms straining, you gasp for precious oxygen to power your body, smelling the scent of the boy that came before.\n\n \n\n You try not to look, but you can feel eyes watching you. For a brief moment you catch the sight of one of the boys from the group in front, staring at your parted legs as you swing from bar to bar.\n\n \n\n He’s trying to catch a glimpse of my briefs, you think. Maybe you should just stretch a bit more…\n\n \n\n \n The thought is enough to set alarm bells ringing inside your brain. Still trying to maintain grip on the bars that are slippery with sweat, you gasp for air.\n\n \n\n Then you see it. Magical embers flow off the gym equipment, drifting into your body as you breathe. You look around the gym and see a similar sight for every activity. It’s not just one thing in the gym that’s cursed, you think. It’s everything.\n \n \n Why am I thinking like this, you hear inside your mind. You take in another quick gasp of air, as you try not to slip on the next bar that is covered in sweet sweat.\n\n \n\n Then it registers. You can almost see the magic radiating out from the equipment, drifting up your nostrils as you breathe. Whatever is causing you to feel like this, you’re sure that’s part of it.\n\n \n You instantly feel off, as the thought echoes in your mind. Something is very wrong about this, you know, but whatever it is feels just out of grasp. Like a monkey bar always just out of reach. Enough of your mind is still yours though to know it has something to do with magic. Because this isn't you.\n\n \n\n *Isn't it?*\n\n \n \n\n You see Coach Beach staring and you dismiss the thoughts to avoid drawing more attention to yourself. Instead, you focus on getting through the exercise. When your group moves on to the next one, you try not to exert yourself anymore than is necessary to finish the lesson.\n\n \n\n By the end, you’ve done enough that you feel you have at least projected the image of hard-work and enthusiasm. You finish short-of-breath, inhaling the scent of sweaty teenagers and cheap spray that tries to mask poor hygiene from some of the boys.\n\n \n\n It’s not so bad, a thought says to you at the back of your brain. Almost attractive.\n\n \n\n Just as you hear the thought, you see the boy from the group in front of yours looking back at you. He gives you a wink. With inner turmoil, you find yourself smiling back.\n\n \n\n \n The last boy in front swings down from the bars and looks back at you to signal you can begin. You flash him a smile and swing forward, grabbing the first bar.\n\n \n\n Your arms strain as you move across the bars and you gasp for oxygen to help, smelling the scent of the boy. You glance forward and see him watching, staring at your legs swinging in the air. It's kind of a compliment…\n\n \n\n \n The thought is enough to set alarm bells ringing inside your brain. Still trying to maintain grip on the bars that are slippery with sweat, you gasp for air. \n\n \n\n Then you see it. Magical embers flow off the gym equipment, drifting into your body as you breathe. You look around the gym and see a similar sight for every activity. It’s not just one thing in the gym that’s cursed, you think. It’s everything.\n\n \n\n \n Why am I thinking like this, you hear inside your mind. You take in another quick gasp of air, as you try not to slip on the next bar that is covered in sweet sweat.\n\n \n\n Then it registers. You can almost see the magic radiating out from the equipment, drifting up your nostrils as you breathe. Whatever is causing you to feel like this, you’re sure that’s part of it.\n \n \n You instantly feel off, as the thought echoes in your mind. Something is very wrong about this, you know, but whatever it is feels just out of grasp. Like a monkey bar always just out of reach. Whatever it is, you believe it's magic. You hope.\n \n \n \n\n Focusing on getting through the exercise, you complete the activity. When your group moves on, you try only to do enough to complete the lesson.\n\n \n\n By the end, you feel you have put in enough effort to at least pass. You finish short-of-breath, inhaling the scent of sweaty teenagers. One of them from the group in front of you catches your eye, giving you a wink. You find yourself smiling back.\n \n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n Once the boys in front of you are done, you amble over to the monkey bars. From close-up, you can see the perspiration coating each rung. Yuck!\n\n \n\n Tentatively, you reach up and wrap your fingers around it. It’s sticky and smelly. You try not to wretch as you push off the starting block.\n\n \n\n The effort to move from one bar to the next is deceptively high, especially when you’re trying to avoid touching them. You inelegantly clasp towards the next one, wobbling with only one hand holding you up.\n\n \n\n “Watch out, boys,” you hear Beach holler. “Timber!”\n\n \n\n For a moment you think you’ve gotten hold of the rung, but as you swing forward your grip gives way and you tumble to the floor.\n\n \n\n You land with a soft thud against the rank gym mat. It feels moist to touch. As you hit it, a number of dust particles blow up. You can smell years of dry teenage sweat exploding like a mushroom cloud.\n\n \n\n “Might want to find a new form of activity, Phillips,” you hear Beach say as he offers you a hand. Sprawled ungracefully over the floor, you take it and are pulled up. \n\n \n\n “I see cleaning in your future,” he says, making a mocking mind reading gesture as he puts his fingers to his temples. \n\n \n\n “It’s not over yet, though!” he says more loudly, turning back to the gym. “Keep at it, kids. You can still fall behind Phillips here if you don’t put the graft in.”\n\n \n\n Beach gives you a polite smile, then walks away. You move off to the side of the monkey bars, waiting for the rest of your group to finish. As each girl does so, they give you a worried look. When the group moves on to the next exercise, you note that no one is talking to you.\n\n \n\n Once your group has completed the last activity, you stand off to the side of the gym on your own. You barely have broken into a sweat. Other girls have noticed. And the boys snigger as they look at you.\n\n \n\n You wonder why…\n \n \n You move to the monkey bars once the boys in front are done, seeing their perspiration coating each rung. Tentatively, you wrap your fingers around a sticky bar. You try not to wretch as you push off.\n\n \n\n You struggle to move across the bars, especially as you’re trying to avoid touching the sweat. Your efforts are perilous and weak. Halfway across, you lose your grip and tumble to the floor.\n\n \n\n Sniggers surround you as you pull yourself up. A few girls from your group cast worried looks in your direction.\n\n \n\n You move to the side, waiting for them to finish. No one talks to you when they complete the task.\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n Beach blows his whistle for a final time and you take a seat on the girls' side of the gym, breathing deeply and quickly. A few girls give you encouraging smiles, others give you dark looks. \n\n \n\n \n Turning back to look at the boys, you know why. Most look sullen and dejected, but a few of them still steal glances at you. Unimpressed, you turn your cheek to them.\n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” Beach says from the centre of the gym. “At least from some of you. Big shout out today to Emily Phillips, who almost went all out.”\n\n \n \n There is a smattering of applause, but the boys seem distracted and subdued. When they glance up at you, they seem almost embarrassed to be looking.\n\n \n Turning back to see a large number of boy’s opposite giving you grins, you know why. With no draw for their attention, you ignore their stares.\n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” Beach says from the centre of the gym. “At least from some of you. Big shout out today to Emily Phillips, who almost went all out.”\n\n \n \n There are whoops and cheers, mainly from the boys' side of the gym. They are all staring at you.\n\n \n\n “Alright boys, settle down,” Beach waves them quiet. “Sounds like a few of them would have liked to see you go all the way.”\n\n \n\n There’s more cries and applause. You hear some of the other girls tutting. You look away from your admirers. The curse might not be active for you, but it’s still leading to some very uncomfortable situations.\n \n \n Turning back to see a large number of boy’s opposite giving you grins, you know why. You flash them a grin back, in spite of yourself. \n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” Beach says from the centre of the gym. “At least from some of you. Big shout out today to Emily Phillips, who almost went all out.”\n\n \n \n There are whoops and cheers, mainly from the boys' side of the gym. They are all staring at you.\n\n \n\n “Alright boys, settle down,” Beach waves them quiet. “Sounds like a few of them would have liked to see you go all the way.”\n\n \n\n There’s more cries and applause. You hear some of the other girls tutting, but you have to admit that being the centre of attention is gratifying. Even if it is a group of smelly boys. And they really do smell good.\n\n \n \n\n You are pulled out of your thoughts by Beach continuing to speak. “On the flipside, there’s always a loser. And that loser has won the star prize of spending tonight cleaning up all the sweat you’ve just spilled on my gym floor.”\n\n \n\n He turns to face the side of the room with the girls on. “So who’s my lucky guest this evening?” \n\n \n\n \n There is a surprising lack of enthusiasm from the male side of the gymnasium. After struggling with the activities today, the boys seem unsure of themselves.\n\n \n He glances back at the boys' side of the gym. They whoop and holler at his beckon. They seem confident that none of them will end up last.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Beach blows his whistle for a final time and you take a seat on the girls' side of the gym. In spite of what you may want to do, your body instinctively acts to gain its breath back.\n\n \n\n \n From the other side of the room, you see the boys talking amongst themselves, their attention for once not on the girls. They appear to be consoling each other. Scared and confused expressions are prevalent.\n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” Beach says from the centre of the gym. “At least from some of you. But we all know what happens to those who don’t perform. Don’t we, boys?”\n\n \n\n There is a surprising lack of enthusiasm from the male side of the gymnasium. After struggling with the activities today, the boys seem unsure of themselves.\n\n \n From the other side of the room, you see the boys watching the girls like before. A boy from the group ahead grins at you. You sigh, rolling your eyes. The other girls who receive similar attention aren’t so dismissive, blushing.\n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” Beach says from the centre of the gym. “At least from some of you. But we all know what happens to those who don’t perform. Don’t we, boys?”\n\n \n\n He glances back at the boys' side of the gym. They whoop and holler at his beckon. They seem confident that none of them will end up last.\n\n \n From the other side of the room, you see the boys watching the girls like before. You shift on the bench, aware of the length of your skirt. A boy from the group ahead grins at you. You feel yourself blushing as you take a short breath.\n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” Beach says from the centre of the gym. “At least from some of you. But we all know what happens to those who don’t perform. Don’t we, boys?”\n\n \n\n He glances back at the boys' side of the gym. They whoop and holler at his beckon. They seem confident that none of them will end up last.\n\n \n \n\n “So,” Beach says, turning back to your side of the room. “Who’s today’s recipient of my favourite booby prize? Who is spending tonight cleaning up the sweat from my precious gym floor?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Beach blows his whistle for a final time and you take a seat on the girls' side of the gym. Even though there is little room to sit, you get the impression that other girls are trying to avoid being close to you.\n\n \n\n \n From the other side of the room, you see the boys talking amongst themselves, their attention for once not on the girls. They appear to be consoling each other. Scared and confused expressions are prevalent.\n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” he cries, before his eyes rest on you. “At least from some of you.”\n\n \n\n No one responds to Beach’s baiting. He seems taken aback by the lack of enthusiasm in the room, scowling back at the boys.\n\n \n From the other side of the room, you see the boys watching the girls like before. Their attention is on other girls. You hear some excited whispering behind you and a few giggles. The girls are still responding to the attention.\n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” he cries, before his eyes rest on you. “At least from some of you.”\n\n \n\n Chuckles echo from around the gym. Mostly from the boys, but even some girls join them too.\n\n \n\n “We all know what happens to those who don’t perform. Don’t we, boys?”, Beach continues. The boys whoop and holler. Most of them are staring right back at you.\n\n \n \n\n “So,” Beach says, looking to your side of the room. He dramatically avoids looking at you. “Who’s today’s recipient of my favourite booby prize? Who is spending tonight cleaning up the sweat from my precious gym floor?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n Beach’s eyes rest on Heather. “Miss Oats, you’ve got a date with a duster.”\n\n \n\n “Miss Oats,” Beach cries out. “Congratulations!”\n\n \n\n \n There is a smattering of applause from the boys' side, but you see the signs of relief in some of the faces. The girls, by contrast, are muttering amongst themselves, each peppered with frowns and confusion. Objectively, some of the boys did worse today. You glance at Heather. She looks shocked.\n\n \n\n Beach seems unnerved by the response. “Get to the showers, then,” he mutters. “Dismissed.\"\n\n \n There are cheers from the boys and are relieved sighs from some of the girls. You watch Heather carefully. Her face drops. Crestfallen.\n\n \n\n “That’s all, folks,” Beach says. “Get to the showers!”\n\n \n \n\n \n \n “Oh, Phillips!” Beach says as you stand. “Stay behind too. I’d like a word with you.”\n\n \n\n There’s a few raised eyebrows directed your way as the other students rush out, ready to shower and go home. You remain seated. Within seconds, only yourself and Heather remain. You look at her, but she keeps her eyes focused on the floor, avoiding your gaze.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everyone begins to rush out, ready to shower and go home.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n His eyes roam across the girls’ faces. When his eyes meet yours, he smirks. You look away.\n\n \n\n “Miss Oats,” Beach cries out. “Congratulations!” Heather’s face drops.\n\n \n\n \n There is a smattering of applause from the boys' side, but you see the signs of relief in some of the faces. The girls, by contrast, are muttering amongst themselves, each peppered with frowns and confusion. Objectively, some of the boys did worse today. You glance at Heather. She looks shocked.\n\n \n\n Beach seems unnerved by the response. “Get to the showers, then,” he mutters. “Dismissed.”\n\n \n The boys cry out and some of the girls sigh in relief. Including, you notice, you. \n\n \n\n The gym teacher turns back to the class. “Get to the showers. Show’s over!”\n\n \n\n Everyone begins to rush out, ready to shower and go home. You glance at Heather as you walk by, but she stares down into the dirty floor.\n\n \n \n\n “Don’t get too cocky, Phillips,” Beach says, as you walk by. “It was touch and go there for a while. You better put in the effort if you don’t want to be taking Heather’s place.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You look down to the floor. You know what is coming. The shadow of your stocky gym teacher falls over you.\n\n \n\n “That’s right,” you hear Beach cry. “Emily Phillips. You just earned yourself an evening cleaning up this gym.”\n\n \n\n \n There is a smattering of applause from the boys' side, but you see the signs of relief in some of the faces. The girls, by contrast, are muttering amongst themselves, each peppered with frowns and confusion. They give you sympathetic looks. Even against your meagre efforts today, some of the boys did worse.\n\n \n\n Beach seems unnerved by the response. “Get to the showers, then,” he mutters. “Dismissed. Except you, Phillips.” He gives you a grin and walks out.\n\n \n Your eyes flick upward as you hear the laughter. Everyone, including the girls, is chuckling at you. The only exception is Heather, who just looks relieved. \n\n \n\n “Fun’s over today!” you hear Beach say as you share a consoling look with Heather. “Get to the showers. Except you, Phillips.” He gives you a grin and walks out.\n\n \n \n\n With the squeak of sneakers, everyone filters out of the room. Heather smiles sympathetically as she passes. Soon you are the only one left in the gym, hearing the sounds of students changing and laughing, but you sit alone waiting.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n “Very good Phillips. Very good indeed,” you hear Beach say from off to the side as he walks over. You turn to look at him. He places his foot on the bench you are sitting on and puts his hand on his knee, leaning forward towards you. Your eyes flick down at his short shorts, noticing there’s just enough slack to see far up in there. \n\n \n\n “Thank you sir,” you mumble, looking up to meet his gaze. \n\n \n\n \n You notice how he's thinning on top and has nostril hairs creeping out of his nose. He clearly still works out, but age is catching up with him in a manner that simple exercise can't counteract.\n\n \n You notice his greying stubble and his ruffled salt and pepper hair. Whilst he wouldn’t feature on the cover of a men’s health magazine, there’s something still strong and chiselled about his physical demeanour.\n\n \n \n\n “With agility and speed like that, you could be in with a shot at a scholarship,” the teacher says with sincerity. “Cheerleading is not just short skirts and pom poms. You can get into some top schools with it.”\n\n \n\n He leans forward, leaning on his knee. You notice the veins more apparent with age, creeping out from underneath his short shorts like tendrils.You see his thigh muscles flexing, clearly still powerful in spite of his age. His shorts also ruffle up around the tops of his legs. You think you can faintly see the outline of something underneath the fabric…\n\n \n\n “If she hadn’t already asked you, chat to Christina,” Beach tells you. “You can try-out on the football field after school. I think you’d have a good chance, if you asked me.”\n\n \n\n You meet his eye. He seems earnest. \n\n \n\n “Alright, get yourself to the showers,” the coach says, turning his attention to the other girl in the gym who sits behind you. “Heather, it's your turn. Come here.”\n\n \n\n You move towards the exit as Heather stands and walks towards Coach Beach. You only look back once, as you open the gym doors, to see Beach leaning in closely to Heather as she looks down at the floor.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "After a long few minutes, the doors to the gym swing back open and Coach Beach walks in, carrying a bucket of warm water and an arm full of cleaning products. He drops them next to you.\n\n \n\n “Alright, Phillips,” he says to you. “If PE isn’t your specialist subject, maybe you’ll excel at cleaning. I want this gym spick and span by the time I get back.” He glances at the stopwatch dangling around his neck. “One hour should do it. So. Get going.” \n\n \n\n Beach waits for you to fiddle with the cleaning products, then turns and walks out of the gym. Knowing what you have to do, the smells of perspiration and drying sweat seems ever more pungent. You glance up at the clock above the basketball net. Fifty-nine minutes to go.\n\n \n\n Picking up the cleaning equipment, you consider how best to tackle this.\n\n \n Coach Beach walks in after a few minutes, carrying the bucket and a variety of cleaning products.\n\n \n\n “Back again, Phillips?” he says to you. “Some might think you’ve found your calling. Get on with it. You know what to do.”\n\n \n\n He nods to the bucket, then walks out of the gym. Trying to ignore the putrid smells that surround you, you pick up the equipment and consider what to do.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n You pick up the bucket and soak a cloth inside it, then get down on your hands and knees to start cleaning. \n\n \n\n Getting your nose close to the ground, you can almost taste the smell of bad hygiene and teenage body odour. You scrub vigorously, working up a sweat. Your polo shirt hangs down and more than once you feel it absorb the dirty water on the floor, touching your breasts.\n\n \n\n As the minutes tick away, your mind drifts. You find yourself considering how long some of this sweat has been etched into the floor, and how many of the people you know have spilled the perspiration that you are now inhaling. \n\n \n\n \n You scrub hard, thankful that the curse doesn't have any sway over you. Your mind drifts to other topics, thinking of Jennifer, then Emily, and how you can help her survive here.\n\n \n\n Time passes and soon you find the hour has gone.\n\n \n Scrubbing hard, your mind fills with thoughts of Charlton men, playing basketball in school short shorts, their muscular bodies glistening.\n\n \n\n You bite your lip as the images refuse to fade. For the rest of the hour, you keep returning to the thought of mopping up the sweat of taut men playing sports in the gym.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You kneel down in front of the benches so you can spray them with cleaning products and wipe a cloth over their surfaces. Despite being alone in the gym, you double-check to make sure your skirt is tucked in between your legs.\n\n \n\n The mixture of chemicals and grime adds a noticeable humidity to the stench and soon you feel yourself sweating. When you move to where the boys were sitting, the odours only grow stronger. \n\n \n\n \n You hear laughter from outside the gym and sigh as you lament on how unfair you find this. Here you are, cleaning up after a bunch of men, who objectively did worse than you.\n\n \n\n Reflecting, you know you could have tried harder. Now that the curse has no impact on you, putting in some physical effort wouldn’t have cost anything. You circle back around to the question - why are you here, exactly?\n\n \n\n For the rest of the hour, you try to concentrate on cleaning, keeping the thoughts out of your mind.\n\n \n You hear laughter from outside the gym and sigh as you lament on how unfair you find this. Here you are, cleaning up after a bunch of men, kneeling in their own dirt and perspiration, whilst they laugh and get clean in hot, fresh showers.\n\n \n\n You grow conscious of inhaling a whiff of drying sweat as you wipe the benches down, unable to keep your mind from drifting to the images your mind conjures. Of the boys, making the most of their showers...\n\n \n\n Consumed with the mental pictures repeating through your mind, you find time quickly passes. \n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n Picking up the bucket, you take a single cloth and walk around the edges of the gym, wiping down equipment as you pass by.\n\n \n\n The smells of dozens of sweaty students threaten to overwhelm you. You run a cloth across the vaulting box and the monkey bars, but make no attempt to remove the persistent stains. More often than you’d like, you glance up at the clock to find that since you last looked barely a minute has passed by.\n\n \n\n \n You hear laughter outside the gym, but ignore it. You breathe in the repellant smell and curse yourself for ending up here. Spending the hour half-heartedly looking for simple things to wipe down, time passes slowly.\n\n \n You hear laughter outside the gym, but try to ignore it. You don't want to imagine what's happening in the boys' changing rooms. Based on the smell in here, they could do with a cold shower. A refreshing one too.\n\n \n\n Spending the hour half-heartedly looking for simple things to wipe down, time passes slowly.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n As soon as the clock hits the top of the hour, the double doors swing open and Coach Beach walks back in, looking around the gym.\n\n \n\n ”Nice work, Phillips,” he says, surveying the floor. “You’ve even managed to get rid of spots that I think I made when I was at school here.\"\n\n \n\n He then glances at you. You become conscious of your ruffled hair. Your sweaty face. And your polo shirt, soaked with dirty water. \n\n \n\n He gives you a grin. You look up to the stocky coach, noticing again his large chest and biceps. In spite of his age, he looks ripped. You coyly grin back to him. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n As soon as the clock hits the top of the hour, the double doors swing open and Coach Beach walks back in, looking around the gym.\n\n \n\n ”Not bad,” he says, slowly walking up and down the benches. Floor could have done with a bit of work, though.”\n\n \n\n You watch him as he surveys your efforts. You catch a whiff of him as he passes, a mixture of sweaty and musky cologne. You briefly wonder if he’s been working out whilst you’ve been cleaning. And then idly wonder where he might go, after class. \n\n \n\n “Good enough,” he says, turning back to you. He gives you a long look. You become aware of how much bigger he is compared to you. You meekly smile at him.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n As soon as the clock hits the top of the hour, the double doors swing open and Coach Beach walks back in, looking around the gym.\n\n \n\n ”Did you take a nap instead, Phillips?” he asks, looking around the room. “Or do you find that cleaning is beneath you?”\n\n \n\n Beach runs a finger down one of the monkey bars nearby and holds it out to you. It’s covered in a black sticky residue, a mixture of sweat and dust. “Does that look clean to you, Phillips?”\n\n \n\n You don’t reply. Beach snorts with frustration. “The carrot and stick approach doesn’t appear to work with you, doesn’t it? Might need a bigger stick. For now, I'll just dock your grades.”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <= 2>>\n \n \n \"Good work as always, Phillips,\" Beach says to you. \"Gym continues to look spick and span. Maybe you've found your calling. Do you do home visits?\"\n\n \n\n You catch his eyes and a look is shared between the two of you. You know exactly what a home visit would entail. Does that excite you?\n\n \n\n Beach breaks the tension with a small smile. \"Alright Phillips, off you go. We can discuss another time.\" He lowers his voice. \"Maybe off-site.\"\n\n \n\n You say nothing, wordlessly handing him the cleaning equipment as you prepare to leave.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n \n “I have to hand it to you, Phillips,” Beach says. “This gym hasn’t looked better. I should give you a key so you can come more often!”\n\n \n\n You smile politely. “I’d be happy to do that, if you’d like.”\n\n \n\n Beach frowns, pausing to give you a look. He then chuckles. “Oh, I was just joking, Phillips. I don’t need the headmaster telling me off for giving special privileges to students. After all, that could be seen as a bit inappropriate.” \n\n \n\n Despite his words, the Gym Teacher doesn’t take his eyes off of you. He seems to be waiting for you to respond. \n\n \n\n You consider your situation. You really need that key, and you know that Beach definitely crossed that line with Heather. The question is, what are you willing to do for him. And how far would you go.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n ”Alright Phillips, that’s enough for today,” Beach tells you. “Just remember, loser in PE always ends up here. Put in a bit of effort next time.” You see him smirk. “Unless, you enjoy cleaning here after school?”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n \n\n “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with being a bit inappropriate,” you purr, cautiously running a finger down his polo T-shirt. \n\n \n\n Beach glances down at your finger, then back up to meet your eyes. You see the hesitation on his face. You’ll have to push harder…\n\n \n\n “That’s not what the headmaster thinks,” he replies to you, a trace of a smirk on his face.\n\n \n\n “It could be our little secret then,” you tell him. “I could do such a good job in here. Cleaning.”\n\n \n\n “I have no doubt,” he says. “I’m sure I could put you to work.”\n\n \n\n You smile flirtatiously at him, running your hand over his covered chest. “I bet there’s all sorts of little things you could find me to do.” Your hand skirts down to his hips. “If I just had that key.”\n\n \n\n Beach eyes you for a second, his cheeks flushed. “That mouth of yours could get you into a lot of trouble, Phillips. And me too.”\n\n \n\n He then reaches for your hand with his, and you feel him move your fingers down to his shorts. Underneath, you feel something stiff and hard.\n\n \n\n “You want that key,” he tells you. “Put your mouth to good use.”\n\n \n\n Your eyes meet his and you realise how serious he has become. Without a shadow of a doubt, you know exactly what you have to do for him to get that key. Are you really willing to do that?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You flinch your shoulders and smile. “I guess it would be a little inappropriate,” you agree with him. “Maybe we should just stick to cleaning after lessons?”\n\n \n\n Beach eyes you carefully, poised to speak. After a moment, he seems to dismiss his thoughts. “That probably would be best, Phillips. We wouldn’t want anyone to get the wrong idea, now would we?” \n\n \n\n You nod, your eyes locking on his. He doesn’t seem to want you to go.\n\n \n\n “Good job today,” he tells you. “I’ll see you at your next class.”\n\n \n\n Beach turns and walks over to put away some of the equipment still left out, leaving you alone.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n \n \n\n Shaking, you feel the hard wooden floor touch your legs as you kneel down in front of Coach Beach. You look up at him, towering over you, grinning as he meets your eyes.\n\n \n\n “Time’s ticking,” he tells you, softly.\n\n \n\n You stare directly in front of you, your eyeline horizontal to his short gym shorts. You can see the outline of his erect member clear through the fabric.\n\n \n\n *Gulp*. Nervousness and fear rushes through you. But you have already made this decision.\n\n \n\n You reach to his shorts and tug them down, revealing a massive stiff cock that pops out inches away from your face. With trepidation, you brush your fingers along it, beginning to stroke. It’s warm to the touch. Your fingers look tiny against it.\n\n \n\n “Mouth,” Beach commands, looking down at you.\n\n \n\n You nod, and looking up at him, guide the tip towards you. You stare up at him as you open your mouth, moving your head forward as you wrap your lips around it.\n\n \n\n Tasting salty precum as it enters, you hear a slurp as you coat the shaft with salvia. A rush of butterflies flutter up inside of you. You begin to move back and forth, taking Beach’s cock further into your mouth.\n\n \n\n He groans. You look up at him as you bob your head, meeting his eyes as you take his prick inside of you. He grins, and you reflexively try to grin back. You feel his hands gently resting on your hair, pushing you down on him further.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You pull back your hand slowly, still looking at Beach. A crooked smile rises up on his face. \n\n \n\n “All talk and no action, eh Phillips?” he mutters. “Not the first who’s tried to play games with me.”\n\n \n\n He reaches down and takes the cleaning products up. “You should leave. It’s getting late.”\n\n \n\n Beach makes no effort to move, expecting you to go. Seeing no other option, you nod and walk towards the door.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n\n Whether from magic or imagination, you have an image of yourself out-of-body. Here you are, kneeling in the gym, dressed in your PE uniform, with your teacher’s cock in your mouth as he begins to face fuck you.\n\n \n\n You love this, don’t you? a voice asks.\n\n \n\n Beach grips on to your hair harshly, regaining control. He bucks forward, no longer giving you a role. Your teacher is now in control.\n\n \n\n Then he moans with ecstasy, and you feel your mouth fill up with hot sticky cum.\n\n \n\n It takes everything you have not to gag. Jet after jet hits the back of your throat. Beach holds on to your head with a vice-like grip. You have no choice but to swallow.\n\n \n\n Beach finishes with a long sigh, pulling his prick out of your mouth with a pop. You gasp for air, then wipe your lips, still tasting residual cum on your breath.\n\n \n\n “Fuck,” Beach exclaims, chuckling. “That mouth is good for more than just words, Phillips.” He pulls his shorts back over his member and reaches into the back pocket, producing a key. “Here. You’ve earned it. I'll give you a good mark in PE too.\"\n\n \n\n Still kneeling, you look at the key he holds out. You reach out to take it, but he pulls back as you do so, shaking his head slightly. “Open wide.”\n\n \n\n You pause, looking at him. With no other option, you drop back down and open your mouth. \n\n \n\n He grins and gently places the key on your tongue, then puts your lips together. You taste the iron of the key mixed in with Beach’s sweat from his shorts.\n\n \n\n “I’ll be seeing you, Phillips,” he says, signalling it’s time for you to leave.\n\n \n\n Taking the key out of your mouth, you stand up and head towards the door.\n\n \n \n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "“Alright kids,” you hear Beach bellow. Like everyone else, you turn to look at him in the centre of the gym, as if it was a stage. “Weatherman says it’s going to drizzle today. And whilst I think you all can survive a bit of rain, I’ve been told that some of you have weak immune systems. I don’t need your moms on the phone yelling at me for getting you sick.”\n\n \n\n “So same old, same old. Inside activities. Boys with boys. Girls with girls. Pair off into fives and go stand by one of the obstacles on the course. Only rule - don’t come last.”\n\n \n\n There’s a scramble as the boys sort themselves, but you already know what’s coming. By the time the jocks have staked their claim and the louder boys have buddied up, you’re left standing on the edge. A trio of boys glance at you, then groan.\n\n \n\n “Great,” one mutters. “We’ve got Mannet.”\n\n \n\n Another shakes his head, arms folded. “Just try to keep up, yeah? If you drag us down, you'll be cleaning the gym.”\n\n \n\n Their eyes linger on you, sceptical. Expecting the worst. You fall in with your group, their glares sharp on your back as the obstacles loom ahead. Your group shuffles into the queue, the polished wood of the vaulting box gleaming under the strip lights. Like everything in here, it smells like a gym sock. Removing the curse hasn't stopped the smell from threatening to overpower you.\n\n Their eyes linger on you, sceptical. Expecting the worst. You fall in with your group, their glares sharp on your back as the obstacles loom ahead. Your group shuffles into the queue, the polished wood of the vaulting box gleaming under the strip lights. Like everything in here, it smells like a gym sock. You find it almost overwhelming.\n \n \n\n The boys ahead of you spring at the box one by one, vaulting cleanly over and jogging on to rejoin their mates. Their laughter echoes back as they glance at you, waiting for the inevitable.\n\n \n\n Your turn is coming.\n \n \n “Alright, settle down!” Beach bellows from the centre of the room. He gestures to the drizzle hitting the exterior of the full length windows and tells the group with some disappointment that you’ll again be spending the lesson inside today. \n\n \n\n “Hop to it, then,” he tells the class. “Get in your groups and try to conjure up at least a little enthusiasm. Loser still gets the booby prize.”\n\n \n\n There’s a scramble as the boys sort themselves, but you already know what’s coming.

The hobby horse looms ahead. It's too high for this body, but you drive your arms down hard, legs kicking, chest hauling forward.\n\n \n\n For a moment you think you’ll clip it. But you clear, landing hard on the other side, stumbling a step before straightening.\n\n \n\n A small bark of approval rises from the boys waiting ahead. You jog over to rejoin them, your chest still heaving.\n\n \n\n “Didn’t think you had it in you, Mannet,” one mutters, shaking his head with a grin.\n\n \n\n The last of your group vaults, thudding down in a clean landing. Then the girls take their turn. A ripple of anticipation goes through the boys as a line of orange skirts steps forward.\n\n \n\n Michelle is up first. She runs fast, vaults with practiced ease, landing lightly. One of the lads leans toward the group, smirking. “Take a look at her. She knows how to climb on top of things.” Laughter breaks out, rough and low.\n\n \n\n \n Michelle glances over, a pitying look on her face. She walks over to her group, rolling her eyes. \"Jerks,\" you hear someone mutter.\n\n \n\n Then you feel a jab in your shoulder. “Hey, Mannet. That’s more your type, right?”\n\n \n\n You glance back toward the vault. Heather Oates is at the block now, hesitating. She grips the sides awkwardly, dragging herself up. Her leg catches, skirt rising as she struggles to get over.\n\n \n\n A wolf whistle cuts the air. One of the boys elbows you again, grinning. “C’mon. Give her some encouragement.”\n\n \n\n Another jab pushes at your arm. The group waits, laughter still bubbling, eyes flicking between Heather on the vault and you.\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n Michelle looks back at your group, flashing a grin at the laughter. If she's offended, she unequivocally doesn't show it. In fact, by the way she poses on the side of the mat, hand on her hip, she's almost encouraging it.\n\n \n\n Then you feel a jab in your shoulder. “Hey, Mannet. That’s more your type, right?”\n\n \n\n You glance back toward the vault. Heather Oates is at the block now, hesitating. She grips the sides awkwardly, dragging herself up. Her leg catches, skirt rising as she struggles to get over.\n\n \n\n A wolf whistle cuts the air. One of the boys elbows you again, grinning. “C’mon. Give her some encouragement.”\n\n \n\n Another jab pushes at your arm. The group waits, laughter still bubbling, eyes flicking between Heather on the vault and you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n \n\n You break into a run, forcing yourself just hard enough to make it over. Your chest bumps the horse, knees catching clumsily as you haul yourself across. You land with a stumble, ankles jarring, but you stay upright.\n\n \n\n Not graceful. Not impressive. But not last.\n\n \n\n Your group barely notice. A mutter, a shake of the head, then their attention is already on the next boy vaulting cleanly. You jog over to join them, sweat sticking to your shirt, ignored as if you weren’t even there.\n\n \n\n The final boy clears, and the line of girls steps forward. Orange skirts, pale legs, each waiting her turn. The boys around you lean in, grinning.\n\n \n\n Michelle takes the run-up, vaulting high and neat. Her skirt snaps as she lands lightly. “Take a look at her,” one of the lads mutters, low and sharp. “She knows how to climb on top of things.”\n\n \n\n The group bursts into laughter, elbows jabbing, eyes flicking between Michelle and each other.\n\n \n\n “Nice landing, sweetheart!” another calls across the gym.\n\n \n\n Michelle lands sharp and turns on them, rolling her eyes with open derision. She smooths down her skirt and stalks back into line without a word. The boys’ laughter falters, glances traded in puzzlement, as if they can’t quite believe she hasn’t played along.\n\n Michelle straightens and, to your surprise, flashes a smile back at them. She dips her head, almost a bow, before hurrying back into line. The laughter swells, the boys barking approval, delighted by her show.\n\n \n\n You stand among them, silent. The difference gnaws at you, prickling at the edge of your thoughts. One of the boys bumps your shoulder with his fist. “Gotta do better than that, Mannet. Don’t want to be dragging us down. You know what happens after class.”\n\n \n\n The others chuckle darkly, and the meaning is clear.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n A grin spreads across your face before you can stop it. You purse your lips and let out a sharp whistle, loud enough to cut through the noise.\n\n \n\n “C’mon, Heather! Show us what you’ve got!” you call, voice rougher than you expected.\n\n \n\n \n Her head jerks, cheeks flushing pink. For a second she looks ready to bolt, then her nose turns up, not meeting your eyes. She fumbles the landing, embarrassment setting in as she stumbles.\n\n \n\n The boys around you howl, jabbing at your ribs, clapping you on the back. “Think she likes you, Mannet!” one jeers. Another leans in with a grin. “Didn’t know you had it in you.”\n\n \n\n Across the hall, Heather joins Michelle at the line. The two lean close, whispering, Michelle looking back at you with disdain.\n\n \n\n The laughter presses in, the heat of comradeship buzzing in your veins. Surrounded by rough voices, the sting of jabs in your shoulder, in spite of how Michelle and Heather are glaring at you.\n \n \n Her head jerks, cheeks flushing pink. For a second she looks ready to bolt, then her mouth flickers into a shy, uncertain smile. She fumbles the landing, tugging at her skirt, but the smile lingers.\n\n \n\n The boys around you howl, jabbing at your ribs, clapping you on the back. “Think she likes you, Mannet!” one jeers. Another leans in with a grin. “Didn’t know you had it in you.”\n\n \n\n Across the hall, Heather joins Michelle at the line. The two lean close, whispering, their eyes darting back toward you with each hushed exchange.\n\n \n\n The laughter presses in, the heat of comradeship buzzing in your veins. Surrounded by rough voices, the sting of jabs in your shoulder, and a girl actually smiling at you.\n\n \n\n *Feels good, doesn’t it? Just banter. That’s all.*\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n The jabs come again, shoulders nudging, grins flashing. A whistle cuts the air, waiting for you to join it.\n\n \n\n You don’t.\n\n \n\n Your jaw tightens. You keep your eyes fixed on the horse as Heather clambers awkwardly over it, her skirt riding higher. The others bark laughter, one calls out something crude, but you stay silent.\n\n \n\n The hands at your back still. The jostling eases. What was warmth a moment ago turns sharp, their laughter carrying on without you.\n\n \n\n “Guess Mannet’s gone shy,” one mutters, loud enough for the group to hear. Another smirks, “Not like he’s got a chance anyway.”\n\n \n\n They don’t shove you out, not exactly. But the circle closes tighter, and you’re on the edge again.\n\n \n\n Across the hall, Heather lands clumsily, tugging at her skirt, and hurries off to join Michelle. The two talk in low voices, their eyes never once straying toward you.\n\n \n\n The circle of boys around you has already gone cold. One smirks, his voice pitched just loud enough. “Too much of a pansy to join in. Guess he deserves what he gets after class.”\n\n \n\n A ripple of laughter. No one claps you on the back this time. They turn away, already jeering at the next girl vaulting.\n\n \n\n You’re left standing at the edge, wondering exactly what they mean about after class.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n\n Your group shuffles down the line to the next station. The rusty monkey bars stretch across the hall, metal rungs worn slick and shining with sweat from the boys who went before. The mats beneath are scuffed and spotted with chalk dust.\n\n \n\n The boys ahead of you swing themselves across with loud grunts, legs kicking high. They land in heavy thuds, slapping palms with each other as if they’ve conquered something grand.\n\n \n\n \n You take a deep breath, readying yourself. The smell of stale sweat has no impact on you. As you rest though, you look around at the other students. The boys watch the girls stretch and leap with lustful glee. A few of them call out and whistle as they perform.\n\n \n\n However, the response seems to surprise them. Instead of encouraging it, the girls scowl and roll their eyes. One even calls them out. “Keep your eyes off me, you perv.”\n\n \n\n It’s enough to cause the boys to falter. You notice that as the retorts keep coming from the girls, they grow sullen and silent. Some start making mistakes, slipping on the exercise equipment. You catch Beach looking at them, confused.\n\n \n\n One of them snorts, nudging you in the ribs. “Don’t bottle it, Mannet. You drag us down, we’ll make you pay for it later.” His eyes gleam with the promise of it.\n\n \n \n You wipe your palms against your shorts, heart drumming as the line moves forward. The bars loom above you, slick metal catching the light.\n\n \n You take a deep breath, readying yourself. The smell of stale sweat has no impact on you. As you rest though, you look around at the other students. The boys watch the girls stretch and leap with lustful glee. A few of them call out and whistle as they perform.\n\n \n\n The more athletic girls appear to respond warmly to the catcalls, posing after they complete exercises and grinning between pants. You grimace as you note they are still under the influence of the curse.\n\n \n\n One of the boys snorts, nudging you in the ribs. “Don’t bottle it, Mannet. You make us look bad in front of the girls, we’ll make you pay for it later.” His eyes gleam with the promise of it.\n\n \n \n You wipe your palms against your shorts, heart drumming as the line moves forward. The bars loom above you, slick metal catching the light.\n\n \n You take a deep breath, readying yourself. The smell of stale sweat has no impact on you. As you rest though, you look around at the other students. The boys watch the girls stretch and leap with lustful glee. A few of them call out and whistle as they perform.\n\n \n\n The more athletic girls appear to respond warmly to the catcalls, posing after they complete exercises and grinning between pants. In spite of yourself, your eyes watch them lustfully. You note your chest rising and falling as you gulp in the sweat in the air.\n\n \n\n One of the boys snorts, nudging you in the ribs. “Don’t bottle it, Mannet. You make us look bad in front of the girls, we’ll make you pay for it later.” His eyes gleam with the promise of it.\n\n \n \n You wipe your palms against your shorts, heart drumming as the line moves forward. The bars loom above you, slick metal catching the light.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You suck in a breath and run at the bars. Hands slam around cold metal, slick with sweat. You swing forward, arms burning, legs kicking wild to keep your balance. Each rung jars your shoulders.\n\n \n\n Halfway across you nearly lose your grip, but you snarl and haul yourself back up, teeth clenched. By the time you reach the end and drop to the mat, your lungs are on fire and your arms feel like they’re tearing away from your body.\n\n \n\n But you made it.\n\n \n\n The boys erupt. Louder than before. Rough slaps land on your back, a fist punching your shoulder hard enough to sting. “Bloody hell, Mannet!” one of them laughs. “Didn’t think you had the balls for it.” Another smirks, “Looks like he’s finally turning into a man.”\n\n \n\n You stagger back to join them, chest heaving, pride prickling hot under your skin. For the first time in forever, you’re part of the noise instead of its target.\n\n \n\n Then the girls step up to the bars.\n\n \n\n Michelle goes first. She leaps, swings hand to hand, skirt whipping with each kick of her legs. By the third rung her underwear is flashing, her hair sticking with sweat. She makes it to the end, dropping down lightly.\n\n \n\n The lads howl. “Look at her go,” one snickers. “Bet she knows how to hang on tight.” Another lets out a sharp whistle, low and filthy.\n\n \n\n Their laughter builds, ugly and booming.\n\n \n\n Heather Oates follows. She’s slower, fumbling her grip, arms shaking as she dangles. Each swing drags her skirt higher until she’s wriggling, teeth clenched, face crimson.\n\n \n\n “Christ, Oates, you trying to give us a bloody show?” a boy jeers, setting off another roar.\n\n \n\n A jab hits your ribs. “C’mon, Mannet. Don’t just stand there. Say something!”\n\n \n\n Hands clap your back, pressing you forward. The pack is waiting for you to prove you belong.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n You leap for the bars, fingers closing over slick metal. Your arms ache almost immediately. You swing forward, legs kicking out, and nearly slip at the third rung. Gritting your teeth, you haul yourself on, scraping through until you finally drop to the mat in a clumsy thud.\n\n \n\n It isn’t graceful. It isn’t impressive. But it isn’t last.\n\n \n\n Your group barely react. A shrug. A mutter. By the time you rejoin them they’re already watching the next boy clear the bars with ease. You stand sweating at their side, invisible again.\n\n \n\n Then the girls step forward. Michelle takes the bars with a confident grip, swinging smoothly hand to hand, her skirt swaying with each motion.\n\n \n\n The whistles start immediately. “That’s it, Michelle!” one of the boys shouts. “Twist that body!”\n\n \n\n \n The boys jeer as she swings, but Michelle’s face hardens. Her grip is tight, her jaw clenched, her legs kicking sharply forward. She makes it to the end and drops with a heavy thud.\n\n \n\n “C’mon Michelle, don’t be shy!” one of the boys whistles.\n\n \n\n She spins on them, cheeks hot with anger. “Shut up,” she snaps, sharp and scornful.\n\n \n\n The laughter cuts off. The lads glance at each other, awkward, unsettled. A few mutter, but the jeering doesn’t return.\n\n \n\n You watch from the edge, the prickle of unease crawling up your neck.\n\n \n She glances over her shoulder mid-swing, cheeks flushed, and - unbelievably - smiles. Not coy, not knowing, just bright and eager. Almost like she’s playing the part she thinks she should. She finishes strong, landing neatly before giving a little flourish. One hand on her hip, the faintest dip of a curtsy.\n\n \n\n The boys erupt, grinning, clapping each other on the shoulders. “Perfect,” one laughs. “She bloody loves it!” Another smirks, “That’s the kind of girl you want, Mannet.”\n\n \n\n \n The comment brings you back to reality. Something about this feels incredibly wrong. You look around the gym, almost surveying it with fresh eyes. And see it. Magical embers flow off the gym equipment, drifting into your body as you breathe. You look around the gym and see a similar sight for every activity. *It’s not just one thing in the gym that’s cursed*, you think. *It’s everything.*\n \n \n You find yourself grinning along, as you breathe in deeply. Then it registers. This is wrong. You look around the gym, almost surveying it with fresh eyes. And see it. Magic radiating out from the equipment, drifting up your nostrils as you breathe. Whatever is causing you to feel like this, you’re sure that’s part of it.\n\n \n You find yourself grinning along, as you breathe in deeply. Something is very wrong about this, you know, but whatever it is feels just out of grasp. Like a monkey bar always just out of reach. Enough of your mind is still yours though to know it has something to do with magic. Because this isn't you, is it?\n\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n You draw in a breath and let it out in a sharp whistle. “That’s it, Heather! Show us what you’ve got!”\n\n \n\n \n Heather falters on the bars, cheeks burning, but she doesn’t look your way. She hauls to the end, lands heavily, and keeps her gaze down. She joins Michelle quickly, who turns back to you and the boys with a sharp glare.\n\n \n\n “Grow up,” she snaps, voice cold and scornful.\n\n \n\n The laughter dies down. Michelle’s look cuts across the group, scorn plain in her face. Heather lingers at her side, casting you a look that isn’t a smile at all.\n\n \n\n The circle of boys mutter, their energy wavering, the approval you thought you had shrinking back. You swallow, heat crawling up your neck. For a moment, you wonder what the hell you’re doing.\n \n \n Heather freezes mid-haul, her face blazing red. Then, almost against herself, she flashes you a nervous smile before throwing herself off the last bar. She lands clumsily but turns back with another shy grin, brushing down her skirt before hurrying to Michelle’s side.\n\n \n\n The boys erupt, shoving you between them, clapping your back. “Bloody hell, Mannet. She likes it!” one howls. Another sneers with a grin. “Didn’t know you had it in you.”\n\n \n\n Michelle leans in close to Heather, whispering. Both of them glance back toward you, Heather still blushing as she covers her mouth with her hand.\n\n \n\n The noise around you swells, laughter rough and approving. For the first time, you’re in the middle of it.\n\n \n\n \n Something about this feels incredibly wrong. You look around the gym, almost surveying it with fresh eyes. And see it. Magical embers flow off the gym equipment, drifting into your body as you breathe. You look around the gym and see a similar sight for every activity. *It’s not just one thing in the gym that’s cursed*, you think. *It’s everything.*\n \n \n You take a breath, feeling something jar inside your brain. It then registers. This is wrong. You look around the gym, almost surveying it with fresh eyes. And see it. Magic radiating out from the equipment, drifting up your nostrils as you breathe. Whatever is causing you to feel like this, you’re sure that’s part of it.\n\n \n You take a breath, feeling something jar inside your brain. It then registers.

Enough of your mind is still yours though to know it has something to do with magic. Because this isn't you, is it?\n\n \n \n\n But it feels good, doesn’t it? Just banter. Just being one of the lads?\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n The jabs and elbows come again. “Go on, Mannet, give her a call!”\n\n \n\n You shake your head, jaw tight. “Not doing it.”\n\n \n\n The laughter sours, as the boys turn to look at you. \"Sissy,\" one of them mutters. \"Come on, Heather!\" another one cries. \"Show us those panties!\"\n\n \n\n \n Heather falters on the bars, cheeks burning, but she doesn’t look your way. She hauls to the end, lands heavily, and keeps her gaze down. She joins Michelle quickly, who turns back to you and the boys with a sharp glare.\n\n \n\n The laughter dies down. Michelle’s look cuts across the group, scorn plain in her face. Heather lingers at her side, casting you a look that isn’t a smile at all.\n\n \n\n “Grow up,” Michelle snaps, voice cold and scornful.\n\n \n\n The circle of boys mutter, their energy wavering. \"Stuck up prissy,\" you hear one of them mutter.\n\n \n\n \n Heather freezes mid-haul, her face blazing red. Then, almost against herself, she flashes the boys a nervous smile before throwing herself off the last bar. She lands clumsily but turns back with another shy grin, brushing down her skirt before hurrying to Michelle’s side.\n\n \n\n The boys roar, their approval swelling, clapping each other’s shoulders. “She loves it,” one crows. Another sneers. “See, Mannet? That’s how it’s done.”\n \n\n Michelle leans in close to Heather, whispering. Both of them glance back toward the boys, Heather still blushing as she covers her mouth with her hand.\n\n \n\n You stand apart. The circle closes tighter, leaving you on the outside. You look at Heather, and at Michelle. Their whispers nudging something in your brain.\n\n \n\n \n Something about this feels incredibly wrong. You look around the gym, almost surveying it with fresh eyes. And see it. Magical embers flow off the gym equipment, drifting into your body as you breathe. You look around the gym and see a similar sight for every activity. *It’s not just one thing in the gym that’s cursed*, you think. *It’s everything.*\n \n \n You take a breath, feeling something jar inside your brain.

Enough of your mind is still yours though to know it has something to do with magic. Because this isn't you, is it?\n\n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n A shrill blast of Beach’s whistle cuts through the gym. The class shuffles into place, sweat running, shirts sticking. Boys on one side, girls on the other.\n\n \n\n \n The boys are quiet. Their energy thin and in short supply. Opposite, the girls keep their heads together, whispering. They don’t look across. When one boy lets out a snigger, Michelle snaps her head up. Her glare cuts him silent, his face red as he drops his gaze.\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” Beach says from the centre of the gym. “At least from some of you. Especially from the girls today.”\n\n \n\n There is a smattering of applause, but the boys seem distracted and subdued. When they look over to the other side of the gym, they seem almost embarrassed.\n \n \n The boys are loud, shoving and jeering, voices carrying rough and sharp. Opposite, the girls stand flushed, catching their breath. Their eyes flick often to the boys. A few toy with their hair. Others fuss with their skirts. Michelle arches her back in a stretch, polo shirt damp against her skin, pushing her chest forward with a coy smile that leaves no doubt she knows the effect.\n\n \n\n “Good efforts, good efforts,” Beach says from the centre of the gym. “At least from some of you. The girls gave a good show, didn't they?”\n\n \n\n There are whoops and cheers, mainly from the boys' side of the gym. “Alright boys, settle down,” Beach waves them quiet.\n\n \n \n\n “So,” Beach continues. “Who’s today’s recipient of my favourite booby prize? Who is spending tonight cleaning up the sweat from my precious gym floor?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n Beach’s eyes rest on Heather. “Miss Oats, you’ve got a date with a duster.”\n\n \n\n \n The boys let out a half-hearted cheer, scattered and thin. The girls shift uneasily, some exchanging glances, others sighing with relief that it wasn’t them. Heather bows her head, face hot with shame.\n\n \n\n Beach doesn't linger. “That’s all, folks. Get to the showers.”\n\n \n The boys cry out with jeers. Even some of the girls sigh in relief. Heather bows her head, face hot with shame.\n\n \n\n The gym teacher turns back to the class. “Get to the showers. Show’s over!”\n\n \n \n\n \n As the boys file out, a shoulder bumps yours. Another jabs you in the ribs just hard enough to sting. “Gonna get what you earned in the locker room, Mannet,” one mutters, laughter rippling through the group.\n\n \n\n You feel your shoulders sink, then head towards the door.\n\n \n Everyone begins to rush out, ready to shower and go home. You glance at Heather as you walk by, but she stares down into the dirty floor.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "“Alright kids,” you hear Beach bellow. Like everyone else, you turn to look at him in the centre of the gym, as if it was a stage. “Weatherman says it’s going to drizzle today. And whilst I think you all can survive a bit of rain, I’ve been told that some of you have weak immune systems. I don’t need your moms on the phone yelling at me for getting you sick.”\n\n \n\n “So same old, same old. Inside activities. Boys with boys. Girls with girls. Pair off into fives and go stand by one of the obstacles on the course. Only rule - don’t come last.”\n\n \n \n You turn around and unsurprisingly see boys jostling to get into a group forming near you. Those who make it grin with satisfaction. Those who don't sneer, reluctantly forming other groups. \"You ready?\" one of the accepted ones asks you.\n\n \n\n You nod and lead the group over to the vaulting box. Like everything in here, it smells like a gym sock. Removing the curse hasn't stopped the smell from threatening to overpower you.\n\n You nod and lead the group over to the vaulting box. Like everything in here, it smells like a gym sock. You find it almost overwhelming.\n\n \n\n One by one the boys ahead of you sprint forward, springing hard against the board and throwing themselves over the vault. No one cheers. No one encourages. Each jump is measured with smirks or narrowed eyes, every stumble a mark against the boy who falters.\n\n \n\n Beside you, Manny bounces on his heels, arms loose at his sides. He turns, smirk sharp, voice pitched like a joke but edged underneath. “Reckon I can vault higher than you, Duncan.”\n\n \n\n The words land harder than they should. Your chest tightens, a hot surge running through you. The idea of being shown up, even in passing, bristles under your skin.\n\n \n\n Beach growls again, clapping his hands. “Keep it moving! Line up!”\n\n \n\n The horse looms closer, Manny still grinning at your side, needling.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n “Alright, settle down!” Beach bellows from the centre of the room. He gestures to the drizzle hitting the exterior of the full length windows and tells the group with some disappointment that you’ll again be spending the lesson inside today. \n\n \n\n “Hop to it, then,” he tells the class. “Get in your groups and try to conjure up at least a little enthusiasm. Loser still gets the booby prize.”\n\n \n\n You turn around and unsurprisingly see boys jostling to get into a group forming near you. Those who make it grin with satisfaction. Those who don't sneer, reluctantly forming other groups. \"You ready?\" one of the accepted ones asks you.\n\n \n\n You nod and lead the group over to the vaulting box.

You step forward, heat already burning in your chest, Manny’s smirk needling at your side.\n\n \n\n The springboard slams beneath your shoes. You launch, every muscle coiling and driving upward. For a breathless instant you’re in the air, clearing the horse higher and sharper than the boys before you. Your legs tuck, swing, and you hit the floor in a solid landing, balance locked tight.\n\n \n\n No one cheers. But a ripple of glances passes along the line. Smirks, shared looks, sniggers.\n\n \n\n Manny jogs forward for his turn. He vaults clean, hitting the mat with a solid thud. It’s good, but not high. Not as high as yours, anyway. His grin flickers, falters and slips into a thin line as he stalks back to your side.\n\n \n\n The triumph runs hot in your blood. You can't tell what impact this gym is having on you, but this body responds to adrenaline surging through it. The strength. The dominance. The certainty of having put him in his place. It feels good. Too good.\n \n \n\n When the girls take their turn, you hear the sounds of cheers and catcalls. But their reaction doesn't register. Instead, you feel the surge of standing next to Manny, him slumped in defeat. Small against your physique.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Your turn comes. You take the run, springboard slapping under your shoes, and vault the horse cleanly, but without force, without height. You land steady, but not sharp. Not the best.\n\n \n\n Manny jogs forward, grin wide, and launches himself harder. He clears it with room to spare, hitting the mat with a loud thud. When he straightens, his grin is broader still. He dusts his palms together, eyes cutting your way.\n\n \n\n “Told you I’d beat you, Duncan.”\n\n \n\n The words slip under your skin, hot and sharp.\n\n \n\n No one cheers. No one jeers. The boys just notice. A ripple of glances, sidelong and measuring. Jake Duncan not at the top. It doesn’t go unmarked.\n\n \n\n Brendan frowns as you fall back into line. “You okay, Jake?” he mutters low, quick. That’s all the concern you’ll get.\n\n \n\n Manny’s laugh comes sharper now, carrying further, like he wants everyone to hear it. He shoulders close, puffed up in his small victory, grin needling at your side.\n\n \n\n The burn rises in your chest, hot and insistent. This body hates it - hates losing, hates being shown up. You clamp it down, but the anger simmers, promising it won’t stay quiet.\n\n \n \n When the girls take their turn, you hear the sounds of cheers and catcalls. But their reaction doesn't register. Instead, you dwell on the rage produced by Manny’s smirk, the sting of humiliation burning hotter than the sweat on your skin. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n Your group shuffles down the line to the next station. The monkey bars stretch the length of the hall, metal rungs worn slick with sweat. Boys ahead of you swing across with loud grunts, legs kicking high before they drop to the floor in heavy thuds. No one cheers. Each landing is met only with quick sidelong glances, every move measured against their own performance.\n\n \n\n Beach’s gravel voice booms over the noise. “Hand over hand. Get across. If you fall, you start again. Fail twice and you’ll be mopping this place till sunset.”\n\n \n\n The whistles still come, echoing sharp off the rafters. But when you glance across, you see the girls aren't responding. They work hard, focused on their efforts. There's no performance to their workout.\n\n Across the hall, the girls are running the course too. Their orange skirts whip up as they vault and swing, movements exaggerated, almost showing off. A few whistles cut the air, sharp and crude. The sound stirs the boys into wider grins and louder muttering, the spectacle feeding the energy of the room.\n\n \n \n \n Manny bounces on his heels at your side, arms loose, towel draped around his shoulders. His grin is wider than before, voice pitched loud enough for others to hear. “Bet I beat you across these too.” It’s said like banter, but his swagger is all over it, emboldened by the win. The words dig in sharper, your chest burning hotter with every syllable. The humiliation bites twice as deep.\n\n Manny bounces on his heels at your side, arms loose, towel draped around his shoulders. His smirk is thinner now, but still offering challenge. “Bet I beat you across these,” he mutters. It sounds like a joke, but there’s a snap under it. His lack of conviction gratifies you, body humming with the satisfaction of being the one to chase.\n\n \n \n\n But a moment later, you feel his challenge having an impact. The words hit like a spark. This body bristles at the very thought of being shown up.\n\n \n\n The line shuffles forward. The rungs loom overhead, slick metal catching the strip-light glow. Manny’s grin needles at your side, daring you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n Your turn comes. You step forward without pause, arms already taut with the need to move. Hands slam onto the first slick rung. The metal burns against your palms as you swing up, hauling yourself fast, no hesitation. Hand over hand, rungs creaking beneath the weight, you drive harder than you need to. Arms burn, shoulders ache, but you don’t slow.\n\n \n\n At the end you swing down hard and land heavy on the mat. There's no cheers, but eyes flick your way for brief moments. Acknowledgement unspoken.\n\n \n\n Manny launches after you, jaw set, movements quick and eager. He swings across in a rush, hands slipping once, a grunt of effort escaping. He scrambles back and clears the last rung, dropping to the mat with a duller thud.\n\n \n\n \n He straightens slowly. The grin is gone. His eyes are low. No quip this time. Just silence. Losing twice in a row leaves him hollow, every bit of bravado stripped away.\n\n \n\n The feeling of victory again runs through you. This body hums with it. The dominance, the certainty, the sight of him beaten down.\n\n \n He exhales as he straightens, rolling his shoulders back, the grin flickering weakly into place. “Not bad,” he mutters.\n\n \n \n The triumph runs hot in your chest, but his continuing show of defiance grates you and makes the victory feel incomplete. He hasn’t yielded. Not yet.\n\n \n \n\n “Keep it moving!” Beach barks, gravel voice booming across the hall.\n\n \n\n You fall back with your group, breath still sharp in your chest. You hear more of the boys throw out comments as the girls try the monkey bars, but you don't feel it. Manny lingers at your side and you feel the overwhelming urge to quash his challenge to your throne. You glance at his face and clench your fist. By any means necessary, even.\n\n \n\n \n The thought is enough to set alarm bells ringing inside your brain. You look around, momentarily free from the shackles of your anger, staring at the gym.\n\n \n\n But as much as you strain your eyes, you can't see anything unusual. For a moment you think - and almost pray - that the curse is somehow active again. But there's no sign of magic. No embers flowing from the equipment.\n\n \n \n And as you breathe, you feel your rage stay with you. Whatever you're feeling, it's not due to a curse in the gym.\n\n \n \n The thought is enough to set alarm bells ringing inside your brain. You look around, momentarily free from the shackles of your anger, staring at the gym.\n\n \n\n Then you see it. Magical embers flow off the gym equipment, drifting into your body as you breathe. You look around the gym and see a similar sight for every activity. It’s not just one thing in the gym that’s cursed, you think. It’s everything.\n \n \n\n And as you breathe, you feel your rage swell even more. You can't tell how much of the need to put Manny in his place is driven by this body, but you can be sure that the curse is compounding it.\n\n \n You hear inside your mind. Why am I thinking like this? You look around, momentarily free from the shackles of your anger, staring at the gym.\n\n \n\n Then it registers. You can almost see the magic radiating out from the equipment, drifting up your nostrils as you breathe. Whatever is causing you to feel like this, you’re sure that’s part of it.\n \n \n You instantly feel off, as the thought echoes in your mind. Something is very wrong about this, you know, but whatever it is feels just out of grasp. Like a monkey bar always just out of reach. Whatever it is, you believe it's magic. You hope.\n \n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You ease back as the line shuffles forward, making no move to step up. Manny grins, bouncing on his heels, towel shifting at his shoulders.\n\n \n\n He grabs the first rung and swings himself up with a grunt, legs pumping. His hands slap the bars in a quick rhythm, driving fast across the line. The rungs shine slick with sweat but he barely falters, body taut with effort. He lands on the mat with a heavy thud, straightening with a puff of breath.\n\n \n\n \n His grin spreads wide, full of swagger, laugh carrying across the line. “That’s two for me, Duncan.” He shouts back, smirk flashing to the girls nearby.\n\n \n\n The fury spikes white-hot in your chest. Humiliation twists deeper, as the sense of being shown up twice scrapes raw under your skin.\n \n \n His grin is sharp, brittle, pitched louder than it needs to be. “Told you I’d beat you, Duncan,” he shouts from across the gym. It’s overcompensating, desperate to cancel the sting of the last round. Even so, the jab still cuts.\n\n \n\n Your chest burns hot. The fury rises sharp, not just at being shown up, but at having let him have this victory. Your hands itch for the bars, for the chance to wipe that grin away.\n \n \n \n\n You take your run after him. Grip tight, pace steady, hand over hand until you land. Clean, but not fast. Not hungry.\n\n \n\n The silence from the boys is notable. They look at you with incredulous fear. Manny is ahead. Jake is behind.\n\n \n\n The burn in your chest won’t settle. This body hates it. Hates giving ground.\n\n \n\n “Keep it moving!” Beach’s bark cracks across the hall.\n\n \n\n You fall back with your group, breath still sharp in your chest. You hear more of the boys throw out comments as the girls try the monkey bars, but you don't feel it. Manny lingers at your side and you feel the overwhelming urge to quash his challenge to your throne. You glance at his face and clench your fist.

You hope.\n \n \n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n A shrill blast of Beach’s whistle cuts through the gym. The class shuffles into place, sweat running, shirts sticking. Boys on one side, girls on the other.\n\n \n\n \n The boys are quiet. Their energy thin and in short supply. Opposite, the girls keep their heads together, whispering. They don’t look across. When one boy lets out a snigger, Michelle snaps her head up. Her glare cuts him silent, his face red as he drops his gaze.\n \n \n The boys are loud, shoving and jeering, voices carrying rough and sharp. Opposite, the girls stand flushed, catching their breath. Their eyes flick often to the boys. A few toy with their hair. Others fuss with their skirts. Michelle arches her back in a stretch, polo shirt damp against her skin, pushing her chest forward with a coy smile that leaves no doubt she knows the effect.\n \n \n \n\n But you hardly give it a second thought. Instead, your attention is on Manny, sitting right beside you.\n\n \n\n \n The heat in your chest is victory, raw and certain. Manny keeps his eyes forward, mouth twitching. Then, with a weak attempt at levity, he mutters, “Guess today wasn’t my day.”\n\n \n\n Before you can stop yourself, the answer comes out sharp, dismissive, final. “No. It wasn’t.”\n\n \n\n He stiffens. Falls silent. His eyes don’t shift your way again.\n\n \n\n Beach’s voice drones on, clipboard snapping, the wrap-up spilling across the gym. You barely hear a word of it. All that holds your focus is the shape of Manny’s shoulders, tight and stiff, refusing to turn your way. The burn of victorious rage hums through every muscle.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The draw gnaws at you, bitter and unsatisfying. Victory in one hand, loss in the other, neither heavy enough to silence the burn inside.\n\n \n\n Manny smirks faintly, voice pitched low but smug: “Looks like we’re even, Duncan.”\n\n \n\n The words needle. Heat flashes under your skin, the instinct to wipe the look off his face immediate. But you hold it back, jaw tight, fists locked still.\n\n \n\n Beach’s voice drones on, clipboard snapping, names and results spilling into the air. You ignore it. Your eyes stay fixed darkly on Manny’s profile, on the grin he won’t quite drop, on the challenge unspoken between you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Manny is grinning wide, shoulders square, cocky with his streak. “Two–nil,” he mutters, voice sharp. Then, louder, for the lads nearby. “Jake Duncan’s slipping.” His laugh rings high, too loud, carrying across the line.\n\n \n\n The heat slams through you, fury boiling so hard it blurs your vision.\n\n \n\n He leans in just enough for you to hear. “Bet Christina’ll love hearing about this.”\n\n \n\n The second jab twists like a blade. Your fists clench, every muscle begging to lash out, to put him down. The roar in your chest drowns out Beach’s voice, the clipboard, the whole hall.\n\n \n\n You teeter on the edge, Jake’s body thrumming with rage, the choice pulling at you harder than breath.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n Before you even know you’ve moved, your fist slams into Manny’s shoulder. He jolts sideways with a grunt, surprise cracking across his grin.\n\n \n\n He twists back at you, eyes wide, ready to shove, but the roar in your chest drives you forward again. Another hit, sharper, this one to his face.\n\n \n\n The boys around you erupt, some jeering, some barking laughter. The sound only fuels the fire. Manny shoves back, but you’re already lunging, fists knotted, the instinct to put him down too strong to choke back.\n\n \n\n “Enough!”\n\n \n\n Beach’s voice snaps like a whip. His arm shoots between you, shoving Manny aside, Beach holding you back.\n\n \n\n But he just sneers. “Both of you. Save it for the pitch.” His voice drops, gravel rough. “Get to the lockers, Duncan. Cool off.”\n\n \n\n The gym coach looks at you, almost daring you to object. All that can muster through the rage is a grunt.\n\n \n\n Beside you, Manny covers his eye, wincing in pain.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The heat spikes, white-hot, fists clenching, every muscle screaming to lash out. For a moment you’re right on the edge. You can almost feel the crack of knuckles against his face, the snap of his head as you put him down.\n\n \n\n But you don’t.\n\n \n\n You draw in a breath that scorches your throat, drag the rage back under the surface. Your fists stay knotted at your sides, nails biting into your palms.\n\n \n\n Manny watches you, grin stretching wide, emboldened by the silence. He nudges one of the lads nearby, muttering something you don’t catch. A laugh answers him.\n\n \n\n The roar in your chest doesn’t fade. It just coils tighter, simmering low and hot, promising it won’t stay contained.\n\n \n\n Beach’s whistle cuts sharp through the air, clipboard snapping open. His voice rolls over the class, naming results, praising, scolding. But it’s a blur. You barely hear it.\n\n \n\n All you can feel is Manny’s presence beside you, smirking, cocky, alive with victory.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

Forming a ball of energy, you project it out across the gym like a radar. \n\n \n\n You have to shield your eyes as the gymnasium bursts into light. When you look up and your eyes adjust, you freeze in abject horror.\n\n \n\n The gym, as you know it, is virtually gone. Instead you are in a jungle from an alien world. In your nightmares.\n\n \n\n Tentacles of magical energy protrude from almost every piece of equipment, writhing and wriggling as they seemingly hunt for prey. They hang down from the ceiling, swinging freely in an infinite act of searching out a target. The monkey bars and climbing wall are covered in yellow blisters of pus and magic. And all of it glistens with sweat and body odour.\n\n \n\n You crouch to the floor, trying to avoid coming into contact with any of the magic perversions your eyes can’t believe they are seeing.\n\n \n\n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You stand in the centre of the gym, trying to tap into the pool of magic that resides within you.

Only the smells of body odour and sweat affect your senses.\n\n \n\n Wincing, you recall the teachings of the dark arts. You need to be a woman to use them. Which, in this form, you are most certainly not.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n You are thankful to close your eyes, but you feel your hairs stand on end, all too aware of what you can’t see and can barely believe.\n\n \n\n \n “I curse this object with power beyond its power,” you mutter quickly “Unseen and unheard, it affects all but me.”\n\n \n\n When you open your eyes, a flash of your magical aura rushes out from your body, illuminating the room. The monstrosities in the gym squirm and shake. Inside the blisters liquid bubbles and presses up against the thin membranes. The lurid smell of the gym grows stronger.\n\n \n\n The flash from your aura blinds you. When your eyes adjust, you see the same hellscape, but calmer. Tentacles retract into the equipment as you approach. The blisters on the climbing wall calm as you draw near. \n\n \n\n Within a few moments, the apparitions slowly fade, leaving only the wisps of magic as an indicator that something lurks underneath the still-active curse. \n\n \n “I curse this object with power beyond its power,” you mutter quickly. “Unseen and unheard, its effects will be felt by none.”\n\n \n\n Opening your eyes, you feel your innate magical energies act like a shining light in the gym. The light floods out from you, washing over the magical abominations. The tentacles wriggle furiously. The blisters on the equipment burst and erupt. Pus and odorous gas fill the air.\n\n \n\n You can’t help but breathe in the toxins, feeling flushed and horny. You want to drop to your knees, strip off your clothes.\n\n \n\n Spread your legs, for all to see?\n\n \n\n And then your own light blinds you. When your sight returns, you are back in the gym as you know it. The magical nightmare has faded.\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

Just for a moment, as you consider what awaits you inside. The cheerleaders are at practice right now, but they will perform the ritual after they’ve finished.

For the moment. You move quickly, ambling over some equipment in the alcove and perching down behind a trolley filled with sweaty mats. Only the hum of distant generators breaks the silence. \n\n \n\n For a second you wonder if this is a fool’s errand. After all, the cheerleaders could be planning this any night. If they are planning it at all.\n\n \n\n But you summon up your resolve, as you picture what will happen to Terrence if this takes place. The smells of the gym concern you, but you steady your nerves. This is right.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n\n Time passes. Through the windows you watch as the evening dusk turns to black moonlight. The sounds of pigeons cooing can be heard through the thin glass. \n\n \n\n Then, the gym door bounds open. You jump. Striding in, dressed in full uniform, are the cheerleaders. Christina, Britney, Stacey and Reagan. At the sight of you, Britney grins. “Hey Em!” she beams. In contrast, Reagan glares silently.\n\n \n\n “Alright ladies,” Christina barks. “We don’t have much time. Start to prep. The charms will compel Terrence to walk in here any minute.”\n\n \n\n You watch as Britney and Stacey lift a bench over from the side of the gym. “Ow!” Britney squeals, dropping her end as she holds her hand. “I think I broke a nail!”\n\n \n\n As the cheerleaders start to prepare, Christina walks over. “Thanks for joining, Emily. It’s an important one. You must be wondering what is going to happen tonight.”\n\n \n\n When you nod, Christina continues in a low voice. “Sometimes, the charms we use aren’t enough. Some students are just lost. Simple magic just can’t help them. Tonight, we’re going to help one of them. Terrence.”\n\n \n\n \"What's wrong with him?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n “He’s confused,” Christina replies. “Scared. He feels things that he doesn’t understand. Or want. But we’re going to help him.”\n\n \n\n You frown. “What exactly does he feel?”\n\n \n\n Christina smiles, almost with sympathy. “Girls are made for boys, Emily,” she states. “Terrence is plagued by thoughts that counter that.”\n\n \n\n Before you can ask further questions, Reagan approaches. She glares at you, but turns to Christina. “He’s approaching. It’s time.”\n\n \n\n Christina looks back and you do the same. The others have marked out a pentagram around the bench with chalk. Britney kneels on the edge of it, looking at her chipped nail.\n\n \n\n “Stacey,” Christina barks. “Go stand in the corridor and look for Terrence. When he comes near, guide him in. Britney, you’ll do the final kiss.”\n\n \n\n “Shocking,” Reagan quips. “Britney kissing a boy.”\n\n \n\n As Stacey leaves, Reagan silently walks and joins Britney. You look to Christina. She gestures for you to do the same. “Go join the others,” she tells you. “Concentrate on summoning your internal power. When the time comes, you’ll feel the words come naturally. We’ll do the rest.”\n\n \n\n Without much choice for now, you take your place at the side of Britney. She flashes you a grin. “Don’t worry, Em. Nothing bad is going to happen. We’ll help you through it.”\n\n \n\n You consider your options. You need to interrupt the spell, like it was said in the dream. If it goes wrong during the chant, it can’t be redone. But you feel the power of Christina, Reagan, even Britney. You know that you’d be outmatched… and the ritual would continue without you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You try to keep yourself calm, Britney and Reagan beside you. Christina standing waiting. Just like in the dream.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, the gym doors creak open. Stacey walks Terrence in, her gangly frame more than enough to keep him upright. His eyes look fazed, his steps are staggered. Any other person would assume he was drunk, but you sense the Confusion spell is active.\n\n \n\n Stacey sets him down on the bench and completes the squad’s semi-circle, now complete. Terrence’s eyes wandering, unsettled. \n\n \n\n “Welcome Terrence,” Christina says, leaning in close to him. “No need to worry. You’re safe now. Stacey found you outside. Have you been drinking?”\n\n \n\n “Drinking?” Terrence slurs. \n\n \n\n “Looks like you last Saturday night, Brit,” Stacey mumbles. Britney scowls at her and elbows her in the stomach. “Ow!” \n\n \n\n “Will you shut up!” Chrissie hisses back at them, before turning back to Terrence. “It’s okay. We’ll look after you.”\n\n \n\n Britney, Stacey and Reagan start to mumble. A chant. Low and in unison. You feel a swell inside of you. A stirring of energy. Without realizing, you begin to speak words unknown to you. \n\n \n\n He called it longing as he tried to pretend, \n\n But these desires must now end.\n\n \n\n You look around the gym, suddenly aware of the ticking clock. Your eyes scan for something - anything - that could disrupt this without giving yourself away. But nothing seems to catch your eye. Words continue to spill out from your mouth against your will.\n\n \n\n Your voice, like the others, becomes louder. You struggle to focus on anything but the spell. A soft amber glow snakes through the chalk lines in the pentagram, pulsing. Tiny faces rise up from the magic, drifting toward Terrence.\n\n \n\n Burn the doubt that should not grow,\n\n All that he felt, he’ll never know.\n\n \n\n Your eyes dart around the gym. Still trying to find an object that can aid you. As you flinch your head to look, your muscles strain to respond to your movements. Your own body, betraying your mind, focused on muttering the words that you know without knowing them.\n\n \n\n Mirror bright and voices cheer,\n\n Make his purpose crystal clear.\n\n \n\n The pentagram glows with magic. The faces within snake around faster, snapping as they drift up. And then, Christina looks to you. “Now, Emily. Stand.” Her fingers drift to the magic, then to Terrence, then back to you. She reaches out and drags you to your feet, whispering: “Seal it with a kiss.“\n\n \n\n False confessions now unwind,\n\n \n \n Christina drags you forward and your feet don’t deny her. Magical creatures curl up your legs, running down your body. And you step forward again, standing in front of Terrence’s rolling head.\n\n \n\n “Do it,” Christina barks.\n\n \n\n Let fair girls fill his longing mind.\n\n \n\n You will your body to serve you. This is the moment to stop it. But you know if you do so, Christina will be enraged.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You lean your lips in, pressing them to Terrence's. A ripple of magic unfurls from your touch, washing over him in a pulse of heat and light. His eyes flutter shut and you are swept away in the moment, kissing him deeply. \n\n \n\n The magic envelopes him before settling inside him, momentarily sucking out the sounds from the gym. You feel the magic surge from you, heightening your senses to levels of pleasure that you’ve never felt before. Only when they die down do you pull back. As Terrence’s eyes snap open , you see his shoulders relax and a shy smile tugs at his lips. His eyes stare up at you.\n\n \n\n Christina steps forward, voice crisp. “Alright you two lovebirds, break it up.” \n\n \n\n You step back, drawing away from him. Terrence watches you go, then blinks and looks around. Confusion visible on his face. He looks to the other cheerleaders, his eyes trying to make sense of it all.\n\n \n\n Stepping forward towards him, Christina smiles thinly. “You were so lost,” she murmurs. “You came in here so confused. But you’re better now. You'll find things are… easier for you now.”\n\n \n\n She gives you a triumphant nod. Sensing her intent, you step back, kneeling with the others. Britney flashes you a grin. Reagan looks, stone-faced. \n\n \n\n Christina mutters some whispers to Terrence that you don’t understand. He looks to you, blushing. Then stands. “I’ll see you around, Em,” he tells you. There’s a glint of a smile as he says it. Then turns and hurries towards the exit.\n\n \n\n Britney and Stacey look to each other, then get up and wordlessly shift the bench back and wiping off the chalk from the floor. Reagan looks to you darkly, but turns her attention to scrubbing the chalk off the floor.\n\n \n\n Walking over, Chrissie smiles widely. “Congratulations, Emily,” she says. “You’ve done something important today. Something that will help. How do you feel?”\n\n \n\n You can’t even begin to answer her. \n\n \n\n “It’s okay,” she continues. “You’ll be tired. For a few days. Take some time to recover. You’ll find that your abilities will be heightened. It’s intoxicating, isn’t it?”\n\n \n\n You mumble a goodbye, then walk towards the exit. For a moment, your heart is heavy as you consider Terrence. You can only wonder what he’ll be like now. But there is a flutter in your body. Something akin to attraction, but not quite for Terrence. For power. The surge of magic in your body feels… intoxicating.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Gathering every element of willpower you can muster, you hold back your fear. The energy swirls inside you, urging you to complete the ritual. Instead, you step back and channel it into the floor. It strikes the pentagram, sending dust up into a cloud as the pentagram breaks. Magic rushes out of it and spreads across the gym, dissipating into the floor. The monstrous creatures melt away, leaving silence.\n\n \n\n Terrence jolts upright on the bench, confusion clouding his eyes. Before he can gather himself, Christina’s hand snaps forward. “Sleep… and forget.”\n\n \n\n A pale wave of forget-spell washes over him, and he slumps over on the bench.\n\n \n\n “Emily,” Christina hisses, stepping between you and Terrence. “You’ve ruined everything.” \n\n \n\n There is silence and blank stares from all except Christina. Even Reagan doesn’t say a word. \n\n \n\n “What do you think you were doing?” Christina spits, leaning in close to you.\n\n \n\n In spite of Christina’s presence, a feeling of righteousness bubbles within you. “This isn’t right,” you say. “This isn’t what we should be doing.”\n\n \n\n Christina eyes you with hatred. Her voice is low, viper-quiet. “This is exactly what we should be doing,” she tries to correct you. “Helping him fit in. Round off those rough edges. But you’ve ruined it for him.”\n\n \n\n You steady yourself, chest heaving. “This isn’t help. It’s cruelty.”\n\n \n\n Christina’s lips curl. She lifts her chin. “Then you’re no longer one of us.” With a sharp gesture, she severs your bond to the squad. “Take him and go. His life will be harder now, thanks to you.”\n\n \n\n You hold Chrissie’s look, before stepping around her and over to Terrence. Aware of the eyes of everyone else on you. Gently, you slap his face. \n\n \n\n He comes to, quickly. Terrence’s eyes flick to yours, dazed and searching. You drop to one knee beside the bench, lifting his arm. “Terrence, it’s me. Emily. Are you all right?”\n\n \n\n He touches his chest, as if recalling a distant dream. “Emily?” he whispers, voice brittle with disorientation.\n\n \n\n You slip your arm around his waist, supporting him. He sways as you guide him off the floor toward the doorway. You glance over your shoulder only once, seeing the other cheerleaders watching you leave with fear on their faces, Christina burning with anger as she stares at you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Time passes. Through the windows you watch as the evening dusk turns to black moonlight. The sounds of pigeons cooing can be heard through the thin glass. \n\n \n\n Then, the gym door bounds open. You jump, but quickly scramble back down. Striding in, dressed in full uniform, are the cheerleaders. Christina, Britney, Stacey and Reagan.\n\n \n\n “Alright ladies,” Christina barks. “We don’t have much time. Start to prep. The charms will compel Terrence to walk in here any minute.”\n\n \n\n You watch as Britney and Stacey lift a bench over from the side of the gym. “Ow!” Britney squeals, dropping her end as she holds her hand. “I think I broke a nail!”\n \n \n \nAs the two of them pull the bench into place, you see Reagan standing watching them at the side of Christina. She rolls her eyes. “This would be so much easier if your new recruit was here,” she says mockingly. “Where is she? Is tonight book club at the library?”\n\n \n\n Chrissie turns back to her, shooting her a look. “You don’t push new recruits to do too much, too soon. I’ve seen people baulk at this sort of thing. Remember, I’ve been doing this a lot longer than you.”\n\n \n\n Reagan snorts. “It’s just not a good look, for you, Chrissie. A good reflection on a bad choice. We need to maintain our standards.”\n\n \n\n “Go get the chalk, Reagan.”\n\n \n \n\n Christina turns away, flicking through an old and weathered notebook. Reagan moves towards a scoreboard on the wall and picks up a packet of chalk. She hands some to Britney and Stacey, who get down on their knees, marking out a pentagram around the bench. \n\n \n\n “What are you doing?” you hear Christina’s voice bellow out, as she storms over to the pair. \n\n \n\n They glance at each other, confusion evident. “Marking out the pentagram,” Stacey volunteers.\n\n \n\n “And how are you going to complete it with the bench already in the way?”\n\n \n\n Christina sighs. She glances back to Reagan, yawning off to the side. “Reagan, take Stacey’s place and show Britney how to do it, would you?”\n\n \n\n Britney and Stacey share a confused look, as Reagan pushes Stacey to the side. \n\n \n\n “Alright. Stacey, go stand in the corridor and look for Terrence. When he comes near, guide him in. Britney, you’ll do the final kiss.”\n\n \n\n “Shocking,” Reagan quips. “Britney kissing a boy.”\n\n \n\n As Reagan and Britney finish off the chalk marking, Stacey leaves. Presumably to get Terrence. You take a breath. It looks like the ritual will occur tonight, after all. Your eyes flicker around the gym, assessing options. There’s a fire alarm on the wall, but even that stopped them they’d start again tomorrow. You recall Skye’s words in the dream. If it goes wrong, it can’t be redone.\n\n \n\n You inwardly sigh, as you realise you need to wait until the ritual starts before acting. And what you will do, you still have no idea.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n You try to keep yourself calm, Britney and Reagan kneel down at the edge of the pentagram, Christina standing waiting. Just like in the dream.\n\n \n\n Minutes later, the gym doors whine as they’re opening. Stacey walks Terrence in, her gangly frame more than enough to keep him upright. His eyes look fazed, his steps are staggered. Any other person would assume he was drunk, but you sense the Confusion spell is active.\n\n \n\n Stacey sets him down on the bench and completes the squad’s semi-circle, now complete. Terrence’s eyes wandering, unsettled. \n\n \n\n “Welcome Terrence,” Christina says, leaning in close to him. “No need to worry. You’re safe now. Stacey found you outside. Have you been drinking?”\n\n \n\n “Drinking?” Terrence slurs. \n\n \n\n “Looks like you last Saturday night, Brit,” Stacey mumbles. Britney scowls at her and elbows her in the stomach. “Ow!” \n\n \n\n “Will you shut up!” Chrissie hisses back at them, before turning back to Terrence. “It’s okay. We’ll look after you.”\n\n \n\n Britney, Stacey and Reagan start to mumble. A chant. Low and in unison. Terrence gazes up. Christina reaches to him, smoothing down his hair. “Don’t worry, Terrence. It will all be better soon.”\n\n \n\n The chant increases, words now clear. Words similar to those you’ve heard before.\n\n \n\n *He called it longing as he tried to pretend,\n\n But these desires must now end.*\n\n \n\n You look around the gym, suddenly aware of the ticking clock. Your eyes scan for something - anything - that could disrupt this without giving yourself away. But nothing seems to catch your eye. \n\n \n\n The volume of chanting rises. A soft amber glow snakes through the chalk lines in the pentagram, pulsing. Tiny faces rise up from the magic, drifting toward Terrence.\n\n \n\n *Burn the doubt that should not grow,\n\n All that he felt, he’ll never know.*\n\n \n\n Your eyes dart around the gym. Still trying to find an object that can aid you. You could throw a ball at them, but that would expose you. Or push the mat trolley towards them. But they’d see that bulky thing coming. And still see it was you.\n\n \n\n *Mirror bright and voices cheer,\n\n Make his purpose crystal clear.*\n\n \n\n The pentagram glows with magic. The faces within snake around faster, snapping as they drift up. Christina looks to Britney. “Ready?”\n\n \n\n *False confessions now unwind,*\n\n \n\n She rises to her feet, magic creatures scuttering across her body. Her face looks disgusted at the sight of them, but she still moves forward. Standing next to Chrissie. Towards Terrence.\n\n \n\n “Do it,” Christina barks.\n\n \n\n *Let fair girls fill his longing mind.*\n\n \n\n There’s no other choice. You’re out of options. You either need to use magic to try to stop it, run in and rush Britney, exposing yourself, or let it happen.\n\n There’s no other choice. You’re out of options. You need to run in and rush Britney, exposing yourself, or let it happen.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n “Fall asleep,” you mutter, summoning your internal strength. “And let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n The magic rushes out from your fingertips and hits Britney square in the face, just as her lips brush Terrence's. The magic flowing around her body rushes up to stop it, the monstrous faces snarling, but it’s too late. She collapses to the floor, smudging the chalk markings of the pentagram.\n\n \n\n The pentagram broken, its magic breaks out of its confines and flows into the floor. The monstrous creatures are swept away with it, crying as they sizzle out of existence.\n\n \n\n Terrence jolts upright on the bench, confusion clouding his eyes. Before he can gather himself, Christina’s hand snaps forward. “Sleep… and forget.” A pale wave of the spell washes over him and he slumps over on the bench.\n\n \n\n Stacey rushes forward to Britney, checking to see if she’s alright. Christina, however, scans the gym with intensity. “Who did that!” she barks. “Who cast that spell?”\n\n \n\n You don’t move. When her eyes rest on the trolley you’re tucked behind, you hold your breath with fear.\n\n \n\n “What was that?” Reagan says, stepping up beside her, and to your relief she takes away Christina’s attention from your hiding place. \n\n \n\n “Someone else,” you hear Christina mutter. She looks back at Reagan, her accusatory eyes resting on her. “You wouldn’t know anything about this, would you?”\n\n \n\n Reagan meets Chrissie’s hard look with one of her own. After a long moment, she speaks. \"I may not agree with you on some things, but this was too important not to happen.” \n\n \n\n Christina nods, considering her words. She looks around the gym, her stare falling on Britney and Stacey. “She okay?”\n\n \n\n Stacey is checking her friend’s pulse, looking over her head. “She’s asleep. A slight bruise on her temple. I should take her home and get some ice on it.”\n\n \n\n “Get her home,” Christina says flatly. “I’ll clean up this mess.” \n\n \n\n “What about him?” Reagan asks, nodding to Terrence. \n\n \n\n Christina stares at him for a long time. She seems lost for words. “I don’t know. Put him outside on the school steps. He’ll wake up… and we’ll have to see who he is now.”\n\n \n\n Reagan picks Terrence up with her arms, dragging him out the door. Stacey follows, doing the same with Britney. You are reminded of an old war movie, as soldiers drag their friends off the battlefield. Christina begins to clean up, shifting the bench back and wiping off the chalk from the floor. Once done, she walks in silence out of the door. Her eyes again turning to the gym trolley where you hide.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n **Charlton School Gates**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Gates_night.png]\n\n \n \n Outside, the night air is cool on your skin. You linger at the door, looking for a sign of Christina. When you’re certain she’s gone, you step out and see Terrence lying at the bottom of the steps, asleep. Gently, you slap his face. \n\n \n\n \n He comes to, quickly. Terrence’s eyes flick to yours, dazed and searching. You drop to your knees. “Terrence, it’s me. Emily. Are you all right?”\n\n \n\n He touches his chest, as if recalling a distant dream. “Emily?” he whispers, voice brittle with disorientation. “What’s happening?” his stammer returning as his senses return.\n\n \n \n He comes to, quickly. Terrence’s eyes flick to yours, dazed and searching. You drop to your knees. “Terrence, it’s me. Are you all right?”\n\n \n\n He touches his chest, as if recalling a distant dream. “What?” he whispers, voice brittle with disorientation. “What’s happening?” his stammer returning as his senses return.\n\n \n \n\n “You’re outside school,” you tell him. “I found you passed out. Are you okay?”\n\n \n\n His eyes look around, suddenly nervous. “Oh god,” he nervously mutters. “What was I doing? Did anyone see?”\n\n \n\n You offer him a sympathetic smile. “Just take it easy,” you tell him. “Calm down a little. You’ve nothing to be worried about, Terrence. Or ashamed of.”\n\n \n\n There’s a flash of fear in his face and his eyes dart from side to side, looking for unseen watchers. “Ashamed? Why would I be ashamed? I… just had a panic attack. Happens all the time.”\n\n \n\n He pushes himself up to his feet, fatigue cast away by adrenaline. “I should get home,” he says. “Mother will be worried about me.”\n\n \n\n “Can you make it okay?” \n\n \n\n He nods. Then without another word, darts off into the night. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You burst forward, heart hammering, just as Britney leans over. You throw your full body weight forward, taking Britney out with a shoulder barge.\n\n \n\n She crashes to the floor, sending chalk dust up into the air. The pentagram broken, the magic breaks out of its confines and flows into the floor. The monstrous creatures swept away with it.\n\n \n\n Terrence jolts upright on the bench, confusion clouding his eyes. Before he can gather himself, Christina’s hand snaps forward. “Sleep… and forget.” A pale wave of forget-spell washes over him, and he slumps over on the bench.\n\n \n\n The cheerleaders rise to their feet instantly, looking around. Christina spins on the spot, scanning in every direction. They look past you, around you, but never towards you. And they look terrified.\n\n \n\n Britney picks herself up off the floor, her eyes wide with fear. She glances around and you see her bottom lip tremble. “Oh my gawd,” she shrieks. “Ghosts!” \n\n \n\n Reagan looks at her with a scowl. “There’s no such thing as ghosts,” For once though, Reagan doesn’t roll her eyes.\n\n \n\n “How do you know?” Britney says, her volume loud and her pitch high. “We’re witches. And something just knocked me over.” She looks around the room. “Oh please don’t let them be watching when I’m in bed at night.”\n\n \n\n “Be quiet,” Christina mutters. “I’m thinking. We can still salvage this.”\n\n \n\n Reagan smirks. “How?” Christina gives her a look. “Face it, Chrissie. This didn’t work.”\n\n \n\n Christina shakes her head, pacing the room. For a moment you think she’s going to walk into you. But true enough, she seems to subconsciously walk around you. And doesn’t think anything of it.\n\n \n\n She continues to debate internally. Reagan rolls her eyes and moves over to the other girls. \"Brit, Stacey, dump him outside.\" She flicks her head back to Terrence.\n\n \n\n The other girls do as they're told. Stacey and Britney hoist Terrence up, carrying him out. Britney’s eyes ever-darting around the gym, wild with terror. \n\n \n\n Reagan stands closer to Christina. You lean in as she begins to mutter. “Oh dear,” she begins. “What do you think happened? Did you get the ritual wrong, after all?”\n\n \n\n “It was perfect,” Christina says. “I don’t like your tone, Reagan. There’s something else going on, here. Be on your guard.”\n\n \n\n There’s a cold smile. “I always am.”\n\n \n\n Chrissie and Reagan begin to clean up. Satisfied that you’ve heard everything, you make a swift exit.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n You burst forward, heart hammering, just as Britney leans over. Christina sees you instantly. Her eyes flare with fury, but it’s too late. You throw your full body weight forward, taking Britney out with a shoulder barge.\n\n \n\n She crashes to the floor, sending chalk dust up into the air. The pentagram broken, the magic breaks out of its confines and flows into the floor. The monstrous creatures swept away with it.\n\n \n\n Terrence jolts upright on the bench, confusion clouding his eyes. Before he can gather himself, Christina’s hand snaps forward. “Sleep… and forget.”\n\n \n\n A pale wave of forget-spell washes over him, and he slumps over on the bench.\n\n \n\n \n “Emily,” Christina hisses, stepping between you and Terrence. “You’ve ruined everything.” \n\n \n \n As you get up, you look around. There is silence and blank stares from all except Christina. Even Reagan doesn’t say a word. \n\n \n\n “What do you think you were doing?” Christina spits, leaning in close to you.\n\n \n\n In spite of Christina’s presence, a feeling of righteousness bubbles within you. “This isn’t right,” you say. “This isn’t what we should be doing.”\n\n \n\n Christina eyes you with hatred. Her voice is low, viper-quiet. “This is exactly what we should be doing,” she tries to correct you. “Helping him fit in. Round off those rough edges. But you’ve ruined it for him.”\n\n \n\n You steady yourself, chest heaving. “This isn’t help. It’s cruelty.”\n\n \n\n Christina’s lips curl. She lifts her chin. “Then you’re no longer one of us.” With a sharp gesture, she severs your bond to the squad. “Take him and go. His life will be harder now, thanks to you.”\n \n \n\n You hold Chrissie’s look, before stepping around her and over to Terrence. Aware of the eyes of everyone else on you. Gently, you slap his face. \n\n \n\n He comes to, quickly. Terrence’s eyes flick to yours, dazed and searching. You drop to one knee beside the bench, lifting his arm. “Terrence, it’s me. Emily. Are you all right?”\n\n \n\n He touches his chest, as if recalling a distant dream. “Emily?” he whispers, voice brittle with disorientation.\n\n \n\n You slip your arm around his waist, supporting him. He sways as you guide him off the floor toward the doorway. You glance over your shoulder only once, seeing the other cheerleaders watching you leave with fear on their faces, Christina burning with anger as she stares at you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n “You!” Christina hisses, stepping between you and Terrence. “You’ve ruined everything.” \n\n \n\n As you get up, you look around. There is silence and blank stares from all except Christina. Even Reagan doesn’t say a word. \n\n \n\n “What do you think you were doing?” Christina spits, leaning in close to you.\n\n \n\n In spite of Christina’s presence, a feeling of righteousness bubbles within you. “Stopping whatever you were doing,” you say. “This isn’t right.”\n\n \n\n Christina eyes you with hatred. Her voice is low, viper-quiet. “What do you know about what we were doing?”\n\n \n\n You steady yourself, chest heaving. “More than you know.”\n\n \n\n As if to illustrate, you summon a slight flicker of magic within you. A tiny amount. But it’s enough for Christina to feel it. The anger in her eyes dulls, ever-so-slightly. Then replaced with fear.\n\n \n\n You feel magic suddenly surging in her and quickly you begin to draw on your own to counter her. To your side alarm bells ring as the other cheerleaders summon their own power. Magic crackles. A ball of energy appears in Chrissie’s hands. Your skin glows from your defensive charm.\n\n \n\n Christina snarls. And suddenly, it all ceases. It takes a second for you to realise she’s let her magic temper. Another second passes and you do the same. Two more, and the cheerleaders quell their own energy.\n\n \n\n Christina’s lips curl. “No,” she murmurs. “Not here. Mr. Stitch can deal with you.” She throws her hand towards Terrence. “Take him and go. His life will be harder now, thanks to you.”\n\n \n\n You hold Chrissie’s look, before stepping around her and over to Terrence. Aware of the eyes of everyone else on you. Gently, you slap his face. \n\n \n\n He comes to, quickly. Terrence’s eyes flick to yours, dazed and searching. You drop to one knee beside the bench, lifting his arm. “Terrence, it’s me. Emily. Are you all right?”\n\n \n\n He touches his chest, as if recalling a distant dream. “Emily?” he whispers, voice brittle with disorientation.\n\n \n\n You slip your arm around his waist, supporting him. He sways as you guide him off the floor toward the doorway. You glance over your shoulder only once, seeing the other cheerleaders watching you leave with fear on their faces, Christina burning with anger as she stares at you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Then, out of the corner of your eye, you see Reagan looking at you, beginning to do the same -\n \n \n \n \n\n You feel the energy surging in Reagan and quickly summon your own to defend. A spray of yellow energy launches out from her hands, but your defensive counter acts like a shield and bounces off, dissipating into the air.\n\n \n\n The magical senses you’ve grown attuned to tingle instantly, with the sense that everyone except Terrence around you is summoning magic. \n\n \n\n You’re hit from both sides with a bursts of energy, unable to summon the power to fend off the attacks. Darkness consumes your eyes and you feel yourself slumping over - \n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Outside, the night air is cool on your skin. You linger at the door, looking for a sign of Stacey or Britney. When you’re certain they’re gone, you step out and see Terrence lying at the bottom of the steps, asleep. Gently, you slap his face. \n\n \n\n He comes to, quickly. Terrence’s eyes flick to yours, dazed and searching. You drop to your knees. “Terrence, it’s me. Are you all right?”\n\n \n\n He touches his chest, as if recalling a distant dream. “What?” he whispers, voice brittle with disorientation. “What’s happening?” his stammer returning as his senses return.\n\n \n\n “You’re outside school,” you tell him. “I found you passed out. Are you okay?”\n\n \n\n His eyes look around, suddenly nervous. “Oh god,” he nervously mutters. “What was I doing? Did anyone see?”\n\n \n\n You offer him a sympathetic smile. “Just take it easy,” you tell him. “Calm down a little. You’ve nothing to be worried about, Terrence. Or ashamed of.”\n\n \n\n There’s a flash of recognition on his face. Just for a second, but it’s enough to give you a little warmth. \n\n \n\n “I should get home,” he says. “Mother will be worried about me.”\n\n \n\n “Can you make it okay?” \n\n \n\n He nods. “It’s not the first time.”\n\n \n\n Terrence draws himself out of leaning on you. His eyes returning to constantly surveying for trouble. He throws you an awkward smile, then goes to leave. Two quick steps away from you though and he stops. \"Thank you,\" he says, before skipping into the night.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n You come to with a gasp, bolting upright. You’re slumped against the wrought-iron school gates, head pounding as though a drum is beating inside your skull. Looking down at yourself, you see your shirt is missing. You run trembling hands over your bare torso. You’re… you.\n\n \n\n Memory is a hollow ache. You only know one truth: you had to stop Terrence… from something unspeakable. How you wound up here is a question with no answer.\n\n \n\n Then you notice a shadow cast over you. You look up at a familiar face. Clive from the repair shop looms over you, concern creasing his brow. “You all right?” he asks, voice low. “Early start at the Red Room?”\n\n \n\n Your brow furrows. “Red Room?”\n\n \n\n He grins, stepping back. “Looks like you’ve had a heavy session,” he says. “Who put you up to getting that tattoo - that’s a harsh prank for a man who’s had a few too many.”\n\n \n You come to with a gasp, bolting upright. You’re slumped against the wrought-iron school gates, head pounding as though a drum is beating inside your skull. Looking down at yourself, you see your shirt is missing, bra exposed to the night chill. You run trembling hands over your torso. You’re… you.\n\n \n\n Memory is a hollow ache. You only know one truth: you had to stop Terrence… from something unspeakable. How you wound up here is a question with no answer.\n\n \n\n Then you notice a shadow cast over you.

You twist unsteadily and stare, but can’t see a thing. “Here”, he says, taking out his phone and taking a snap. He turns it to show you. A fresh, pink heart tattooed on your lower back. A tramp stamp, bright and throbbing.\n\n \n\n You press a trembling hand to the mark. It burns like a fresh bruise, but is warm too. A low hum of magic throbs entwined with the pain. You aren’t sure what it is, but you know it’s not just a tattoo.\n\n \n\n Clive shows you as deletes the photo, then offers you his jacket. “Get home,” he says. “And stay off the specials at the Red Room. Might give you a good time, but the hangover’s just not worth it.”\n\n \n\n He nods politely to you, then walks on his way.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n **Charlton School Gates**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Gates_night.png]\n\n \n\n Outside, the night air is cool on your skin. You help Terrence down the steps. He leans on you, bewildered and confused.\n\n \n\n “What’s happening?” his stammer returning as his senses return.\n\n \n\n “I found you in the school,” you lie. “You passed out. Maybe a panic attack?”\n\n \n\n He looks at you, curiously. Then nods repeatedly. “I get those,” he says quickly. “Happens a lot.”\n\n \n\n You offer him a sympathetic smile. “Just take it easy,” you tell him. “Calm down a little. You’ve nothing to be worried about, Terrence. Or ashamed, for that matter.”\n\n \n\n There’s a flash of recognition on his face. Just for a second, but it’s enough to give you a little warmth. \n\n \n\n “I should get home,” he says. “Mother will be worried about me.”\n\n \n\n “Can you make it okay?” \n\n \n\n He nods. “It’s not the first time.”\n\n \n\n Terrence draws himself out of leaning on you. His eyes returning to constantly surveying for trouble. He throws you an awkward smile, then goes to leave. Two quick steps away from you though and he stops. “Thanks Emily,” he says, before skipping into the night.\n\n \n\n \n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You stand frozen as Britney leans in and presses her lips to Terrence’s. A ripple of magic unfurls from her touch, washing over him in a pulse of heat and light. His eyes flutter shut, as Britney kisses him deeply.\n\n \n\n The magic envelopes him before settling inside him, momentarily sucking out the sounds from the gym. A moment passes, then Britney pulls back, smiling at Terrence. As his eyes open, you see his shoulders relax and a shy smile tugs at his lips. His eyes stare up at Britney.\n\n \n\n She grins and leans in, kissing him again. This time, he returns her kiss with bashful eagerness. \n\n \n\n Christina steps forward, voice crisp. “Alright you two lovebirds, break it up.” Britney steps back, drawing away from him, flashing Christina a pout.\n\n \n\n Terrence watches her go, then blinks and looks around. Confusion visible on his face. He looks to the cheerleaders, his eyes trying to make sense of it all.\n\n \n\n Stepping forward towards him, Christina smiles thinly. “You were so lost,” she murmurs. “You came in here so confused. But you’re better now. You'll find things are… easier for you now.”\n\n \n\n She gives Britney a triumphant nod, and Britney grins back before slipping back to the squad.\n\n \n\n Terrence’s eyes follow Britney as she goes. Blushing. She glances back at him, grinning. “Maybe I’ll see you around, Terrence. You can buy me a coffee sometime?” His blush deepens, and he nods before turning and hurrying towards the exit.\n\n \n\n The cheerleaders look at each other, then move as one, shifting the bench back and wiping off the chalk from the floor. Once done, their whispered laughter drifts on the air as they file out, leaving the gym without seeing you.\n\n \n\n Watching the empty door, your heart is heavy as you consider Terrence. You can only wonder what he’ll be like now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

You look up and see Rogers looking down over the rim of his glasses.\n\n \n\n He reaches down and turns your book back to the pages of the housewives. Then, he resumes walking up and down the class.\n\n \n\n “First question on page twenty-seven. For the ladies. Mary is trying to cook her husband a sponge cake. She is following a recipe for a family of five. Her book tells her to use 225g softened butter, 225g golden caster sugar, 4 large eggs and 225g self-raising flour. As her cake is only for two people, how much of each ingredient should she use?\n\n \n\n You consider the question. At least it requires maths. You begin to work, writing the answers against the picture in the book. The exercise should be basic for you, but your mind feels fuzzy. The stifling heat is getting to you. Or maybe it’s the presence of the clock that looks over the classroom.\n\n \n\n “Now for the boys,” you hear Rogers say. “Using all his energy, Jack can throw a football eighty yards. His teammate, Todd, is forty yards down the pitch. How much energy must Jack use to reach him?”\n\n \n\n Assuming you should wait for the next question, you stare down at the book, feeling your eyes grow heavy. The heat is making you more drowsy and Rogers' monotone voice isn’t helping. You feel an urge to look up, at least crack your neck and focus on something that isn’t the blurring textbook in front of you.\n\n \n\n But if you look up, you know exactly what you will see. That ticking clock, looming over you.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n Mr. Rogers moves the class through problem after problem. For the girls, exercises asking how housewives could measure sugar without getting flustered. Then, footballers on field length and shooting ranges for the boys. His voice drones on, steady and precise, the rhythm of a man who has delivered these questions a hundred times before.\n\n \n\n \"Question sixteen on page twenty-three. For the ladies.

As her cake is only for two people, how much of each ingredient should she use?\n\n \n\n You hear some scribbling from around you. When you dare to glance up, you notice the girls faltering. Some sit slumped over their desks, staring blankly ahead. Others blink slowly, fighting against sleep that seems to press down on them with every passing second. Their pens hang loose in their hands, exercises left unfinished.\n\n \n\n “Now for the boys,” Rogers continues. “Using all his energy, Jack can throw a football eighty yards. His teammate, Todd, is forty yards down the pitch. How much energy must Jack use to reach him?”\n\n \n\n You find yourself writing. Not sluggishly, but quickly. Answers come as fast as you can scrawl them. Your mind hums with the rush of it, the numbers sharp and clean, nothing pushing against you.\n\n \n\n When Rogers passes your desk, his sharp eyes glance at your neat rows of answers. “Very good, Master Mannet,” he says, his tone almost approving. “See? When you apply yourself, you can achieve something.”\n\n \n\n Sniggers echo around you. A wet, crumpled wad of paper then smacks against your temple. You glance up to see Jake grinning across the room, sneer broad on his face.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n Mr. Rogers moves the class through problem after problem.

You feel frustrated by the lesson's monotony, but remain alert. The girls don't seem to be as lucky. All of them sag in their seats, pens dragging, eyes fixed blankly ahead. Some blink slowly as though fighting sleep, exercises abandoned halfway.\n \n \n\n “Now for the boys,” Rogers continues. “Using all his energy, Jack can throw a football eighty yards. His teammate, Todd, is forty yards down the pitch. How much energy must Jack use to reach him?”\n\n \n\n You scribble an answer in your book, almost instinctively. You're not sure if it's correct, but something else has taken your attention. A nudge at your elbow. Glancing to your side, you see Manny lean in closer, voice pitched just for you. “Look at Mannet.\"\n\n \n\n Your eyes settle on Dennis. He’s hunched forward, scribbling furiously, pencil scratching the workings wildly. He scribbles furiously, correcting himself over and over again as he tries to work out the answer.\n\n \n\n Seeing him try seems to grate you. Heat again prickles in your chest. You grimace as you feel your chest tighten.\n\n \n \n Looking back to Manny, you see him grin and pull a black ink cartridge out from under his desk drawer. He pierces it crudely with a key and places it on your desk. \"Chuck it at him,” he murmurs. “Right between the shoulders.”\n\n \n\n You look from the ink to Dennis. He scrawls, oblivious. Able to concentrate in the lesson. Free of the drowsiness that has spread like a wave through the girls. That he's getting off free drives you wild.\n\n \n\n So teach him a lesson, then.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n Mr. Rogers dictates the exercises from the book. The housewife questions for girls. The sporting questions for the boys. You wonder briefly how old these exercise books must really be.\n\n \n\n Free of the effects of the clock, you look up and for the first time are able to observe the other students in the maths class.\n\n \n\n \n With the curse removed, the students seem alert and awake. There is an even spread of engagement between the sexes. Some of the girls pass notes between them, as some of the boys joke with each other. More studious pupils dutifully scrawl down answers to the questions.\n\n \n\n Your teacher, by contrast, looks confused. His sharp eyes scan over the room, taking in the energetic students. On more than one occasion he catches someone whispering, but he seems more shocked than angry. His reprimand is always cut short and half-hearted.\n\n \n\n You smile to yourself, knowing that at least the maths room no longer has control over its pupils.\n\n \n To say there is varying engagement would be an understatement. Some of the girls are hunched over at their desks, occasionally shaking their heads to fight off sleep. Others look vacantly ahead, eyes glazed over, staring straight into the clock.\n\n \n\n By contrast, you note, the boys are unaffected. Some of them whisper to each other, others continue to work. Not one of them is absorbed by the time, nor seems to struggle to stay awake.\n\n \n \n\n You then see Mr. Rogers walking up your row, approaching nearby. You glance down at your exercise book, an empty answer box waiting to be filled in.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n Mr. Rogers dictates the exercises from the book. The housewife questions for the girls. The sporting questions for the boys. You keep your ear tuned for the ones about quarterbacks and coaches, letting the domestic ones slip by.

You glance up, watching the others in the room.\n\n \n\n \n With the curse gone, the students are alert and lively. Girls swap notes. Boys mutter jokes and nudge each other. The more studious scrawl through the numbers without pause.\n\n \n\n Rogers, by contrast, looks unsettled. His eyes flick sharply from group to group, but his reprimands break apart before they gather weight. For once, he seems less master of the class than the pupils do.\n\n \n\n You allow yourself a brief smile. Whatever force ruled this room has gone.\n\n \n The imbalance is plain. Girls slouch in their chairs, blinking heavily, some staring straight ahead as if transfixed. The pull of the clock is obvious. Its face looms above the board, its ticking stretching out like a presence.\n\n \n\n But when you glance up, waiting for the same fog to descend, nothing comes. Your head stays clear. You can concentrate, even as others fight to keep their eyes open.\n\n \n\n Around you, the boys show the same freedom. They whisper, shove, boast. None glance at the clock.

As before, there is a question aimed at the boys, and then one for the girls. The scenario is always cooking, cleaning or flower arranging for girls. And typically something about sports or fishing or hunting for the boys.\n\n \n\n You once again try not to look anywhere else but the textbook, afraid of what the clock is doing to you. The stuffy temperature of the maths room sets into you once more, causing your eyes to feel heavy.\n\n \n\n There is a yearning inside your body to look up. Just for a moment, you think. Just to get some movement and blood rushing inside your body. Just…\n\n \n\n Mr. Rogers' droning voice fades into the background. You try to concentrate on his voice, just about making out a set of ingredients that a wife needs to make a pastry.\n\n \n\n “What percentage of sugar should she use?”\n\n \n\n Tick, tick, tick.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n Mr. Rogers moves the class through problem after problem. Housewives measuring sugar and flour for the girls. Footballers and hunting for the boys. His voice drones on, steady and precise, the rhythm of a man who has delivered these questions a hundred times before.\n\n \n\n But this time it is different. You find yourself writing. Not sluggishly, not through the haze that usually drags you down in this room. But clearly and quickly, answers coming as fast as you can scrawl them. For the first time here you can actually think. Your mind hums with the rush of it, the numbers sharp and clean, nothing pushing against you.\n\n \n\n Almost disbelieving, you glance up. The clock looms above the board, its ticking heavy, deliberate. You glance up, half-dreading the familiar wave of sluggishness. But nothing comes.\n\n \n\n Around the room, the girls falter. Some sit slumped over their desks, eyes fixed blankly ahead. Others blink slowly, fighting against sleep that seems to press down on them with every passing second. Their pens hang loose in their hands, exercises left unfinished.\n\n \n\n The boys, though, are untouched. They whisper to one another, trade grins and nudges, or scratch answers into their books without pause. None of them so much as glance toward the clock.\n\n \n\n You feel your own head remain clear. For once, you can think fully and sharply. The rhythm of the ticking is there, but it skims past you. Past all of the boys. It is as if the weight that drags at the girls has no hold on you at all.\n\n \n\n The sight is enough to make you bow your head fast, forcing your eyes back to the book. Better to drown yourself in the questions than keep watching.\n\n \n\n When Rogers passes your desk, his sharp eyes glance at your neat rows of answers. “Very good, Master Mannet,” he says, his tone cutting but almost approving. “See? When you apply yourself, you can achieve something.”\n\n \n\n Sniggers echo around you. A wet, crumpled wad of paper smacks against your temple.

Phillips?”\n\n \n\n You look back at him, saying nothing.\n\n \n\n “This behaviour will not be permitted to continue. See me after class.”\n\n \n\n He turns on his heels and strides back away.

Other students gather their belongings, but you remain seated. Within a minute, only you and Mr. Rogers stay.\n\n \n\n He walks over to the door and closes it, then walks over. You remain sitting at your desk as the teacher puts his hands on each side of it and looks down at you.\n\n \n\n “It seems my last intervention has not borne fruit,” he tells you with barely concealed frustration in his voice. “Now. You have a choice. You can either submit to my after school tutorage. Or.” He pauses, considering his words. “Let’s just say you don’t want to choose the other option.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n You stare at the pictures in your book, focusing on the panicked faces of the housewives. They seem to be looking at you, begging for help in solving their kitchen-specific fractions and percentages.\n\n \n\n Actually, they seem to be talking to you. Pleading for you to tell them how to use the right amount of ingredients for their recipes. Squeaking, shrill voices, full of nervousness and worry. The clocks in their kitchens are ticking down to when their husbands will get home from work. Tick. Tick. Tick –\n\n \n\n Something slams down on your desk and you jolt up, suddenly realising that you had drifted off. Mr. Rogers hand claps on to a thick exercise book, which he clearly struck your desk with.\n\n \n\n “I see my lessons continue to tire you, Miss. Phillips. Or perhaps you just find these exercises challenging to the point of exhaustion.”\n\n \n\n You go to speak, but he holds out his hand. “Save your excuses, young lady. We shall discuss them in detention this evening.”\n\n \n\n Rogers gives you a final look, then walks off. Soon, the bell rings for the end of the lesson. You realise that you must have slept through the majority of his class.\n\n \n\n You gather up your things and join the rest of the students leaving the classroom. Mr. Rogers watches you as you go.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You can’t help yourself. With the need to focus on something other than the book, you glance up.\n\n \n\n Immediately, the clock is in your eyeline. As you hear your neck crack, your eyes lock on to it. You watch as the second hand moves around the face, hearing the faint tick, tick, tick as time slips by.\n\n \n\n A finger taps against your desk. You look up to see Rogers looking down at you, an eyebrow raised. “Pay attention, Miss. Phillips. Second question in your book. What percentage of the roses and lilies would you need an even number of flowers in the vase?”\n\n \n\n You glance back at your book. Once again, in spite of the subject matter, the question is rooted in maths. This time, even though your haziness had evaporated, the answer perplexes you.\n\n \n\n You struggle for the remainder of the lesson, trying to answer basic maths questions that seem so simple at first-glance. True, they are all about flower arranging and cake making, but the core to each is percentiles and fractions that should come second nature to you.\n\n \n\n When the bell rings finally, you are relieved to be leaving the maths class behind you. You gather up your belongings and join the rest of the students exiting the door. You catch sight of Mr. Rogers watching you leave, a thin smile painted across his lips.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n You lean back in your chair, looking at Rogers.

Other students gather their belongings, but you remain seated. Within a minute, only you and Mr. Rogers remain.\n\n \n\n He walks over to the door and closes it, then walks over. You remain sitting at your desk as the teacher puts his hands on each side of it and looks down at you.\n\n \n\n “It seems my last intervention has not borne fruit,” he tells you with barely concealed frustration in his voice. “Now. You have a choice. You can either submit to my after school tutorage. Or.” He pauses, considering his words. “Let’s just say you don’t want to choose the other option.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n “Taking a break, Miss. Phillips?”\n\n \n\n Full of confidence, you can’t help but smile innocently back at him. He glances down at your exercise book and rolls his lips when he sees your empty answer box.\n\n \n\n “So. You enjoy wasting my time, do you?” he says, annoyance creeping into his words. “Very well, Miss. Phillips. Two can play at that game. I too enjoy wasting people’s time. Specifically, yours. I’ll see you for detention this evening.”\n\n \n\n He gives you a hard stare, then walks past. You look around to see some of your classmates eying you, an equal mix of fear and admiration.\n\n \n\n You spend the rest of the class doodling in the answer boxes. You pack up your things when the bell rings and leave the room with everyone else, giving Rogers a pleasant smile as you walk by his desk.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You scrunch your notes into a tight wad and flick it back across the room. Jake catches it square in the chest. He looks up quickly and meets your eyes, a hint of surprise that quickly evaporates into dark glee.\n\n \n\n Another ball comes your way. No doubt this one is soaked with saliva. You duck and roll another from your workbook, gobbing into the sheet. Soon it’s back and forth. Spit-soaked missiles arcing behind Rogers’ back. Each hit spurs the next. The sniggers of the class turn sharper, egging you both on.\n\n \n\n Jake hurls one that smacks your cheek, wet enough to sting. You grit your teeth, twist the top from your pen, and jam the nib into a fresh ball. Ink seeps through the paper, dark and heavy.\n\n \n\n You stare down at the paper, now dripping with ink. Something surges up inside you. It could be endorphins. Testosterone. Or at Charlton, maybe even some kind of magic. But the outcome is the same. You want to see this ink-soaked paper hit Jake right in the face.\n\n \n\n Do it.\n\n \n\n You pull your hand back behind your head and launch the projectile across the classroom. It flicks overhead of desks, drops of ink spraying out over other boys, before landing right on top of a shocked Jake Duncan.\n\n \n\n The aim isn't perfect, but you watch as your near-miss is even better. Ink spatters across Jake’s white shirt, spreading in a blot. Jake looks down at it in disbelief. Cheers erupt from the classroom.\n\n \n\n “Enough!” Rogers’ voice cracks across the room. He wheels around and instantly there is silence. Over the spectacles his eyes scan each and every student. You shudder when he meets yours and inwardly sigh when he moves on. \n \n\n Then his eyes lock on Jake, the ink still spreading. “Bathroom. Now,\" he barks. \"Scrub that off before you ruin the uniform entirely.”\n\n \n\n Jake starts to protest, but Rogers cuts him off. \"Enough, Master Duncan! I don't care who your father is. I won't have tomfoolery in my classroom!\"\n\n \n\n The silence grows icy. With his jaw tight, Jake slams his book shut and storms out.\n\n \n\n A few boys smirk. One even mutters approval. You feel it wash over you. A spark of respect and the warm rush of having won. For a moment, you can almost see Jake hunched at the sink, cursing as he scrubs at the ink.\n\n \n\n \n You are taken out of your daydream by one of the girls staring at you with disdain. At meeting her eyes, she looks away and shakes her head. Her derision takes a little of the wind out of your sails, but the next backslap from one of the boys makes up for it. For the moment, you feel you fit in.\n\n \n You are taken out of your daydream by the sight of one of the girls, staring blankly ahead. Your smile falters as you look around the room. The boys might be quietly joking and grinning at you with respect, but the girls either just sit there unblinking, or asleep on their desks. It's almost as if they haven't even registered what happened in the classroom. Or Roger's bellow bringing them back from sleep.\n\n \n \n \n When the bell rings for the end of the lesson, you still manage to smile to yourself as you gather your things. You’ll need to steer clear of Jake later. But right now? Right now, you’ve beaten him.\n\n \n\n *Feels good, doesn’t it?*\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You bend low over your exercise book, pen scratching down numbers. The noise from the other students fades. Only Rogers’ questions land in your ears. You aren't passing up this opportunity. For once, you can actually think.\n\n \n\n Another wet wad thuds against your shoulder. Then another. This time against the back of your head. You ignore it, keeping your eyes on the page.\n\n \n\n More follows. Spit-damp, flicked with practiced aim. One bounces off your hand, smearing the ink across your answer. Another smacks your cheek and clings there for a second before sliding down. The boys laugh, high and mean.\n\n \n\n Then something harder skims across your arm. You wince, looking down at the sudden pain. A shard of broken plastic protractor scrapes across your skin, leaving a thin red line that stings. But you grit your teeth and keep writing.\n\n \n\n Rogers drones on, oblivious. The lesson grinds forward, problem after problem, and you work each one through, steady and stubborn. Bits more of the protractor are launched at you, now evidently shared by the football players. A spread of rough plastic shards hits the back of your neck from all angles. You look back and scowl, but this only encourages them further.\n\n \n\n \n Hoping for aid, you look around the room for anyone paying attention. A few of the other boys are keeping their heads down, not making eye contact. As for the girls, they sometimes look up from their books at your yelps. But for the most part, they offer disinterested looks, almost irritated by the disruption.\n\n \n Hoping for aid, you look around the room for anyone paying attention. A few of the other boys are keeping their heads down, not making eye contact. As for the girls, they are either staring blankly ahead, waving pens around on their books idly drawing circles, or in a few cases are sound asleep. It's almost as if they haven't even registered what is happening in the classroom. Those sitting behind you look through you, not meeting your eye.\n\n \n \n \n The shame bites and you feel heat in your ears. But you keep your eyes fixed on the desk while laughter rattles around you. In spite of the bullying, for the first time in this lesson you can actually solve these math problems.\n\n \n\n The bell finally cuts the air. Chairs scrape back. As you gather your belongings, another crumpled missile skids across the desk. You side-step a footballer’s leg stretching out to trip you, slipping past without breaking stride.\n\n \n\n Your arm stings. Your shirt is blotched with spit. But your book holds neat rows of answers, and that feels like victory. Just about.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You take the ink cartridge from your desk. It is small and heavy, the pierced hole dark where the key went through. For a second you feel the classroom close around you. The scrape of pens. The steady tick above the board. Dennis’s bent shoulders.\n\n \n\n Without another thought, you flick your wrist.\n\n \n\n The ink smacks into the middle of Dennis' back with a wet thud. It bursts. Black blooms across his shirt and spatters his open workbook. His pencil jerks, scoring a crooked streak down the page. He goes rigid, as if bracing for a blow that has already landed.\n\n \n\n Manny barks a laugh that draws attention. A couple of boys join in, whistles and short jeers. Chairs creak as they shift to see. Dennis tries to look at the blot on his back, fingers trembling around his own pen. His awkwardness more awkward by his lack of agility.\n\n \n\n At the edges of the room, a few girls glance up, voices low and fast. They glance between you and Dennis. Some roll their eyes.\n\n Most of the girls do not stir. Their pens drag. Eyes half-lidded, faces slack in the clock’s slow pull, they keep working through half-finished questions as if nothing has happened.\n\n \n\n “Master Mannet.” Rogers’ voice cuts across the air as he strides between desks. He does not look at you, nor Manny. He stops at Dennis’s table and stares at the mess. “Enough fooling about. Focus.”\n\n \n\n Dennis looks as though he's about to object, but only for a moment. Instead, he nods without lifting his head. He hunches over his exercise book and returns to answering questions, as ink spreads over the back of his white shirt. Warmth runs through you and a grin forms. You watch Dennis’s shoulders hitch, the stain soaking into the cotton.\n\n \n\n *That will show him. Remind him at least it's not easy street around here just because he's a boy.*\n\n \n\n Manny sniggers next to you. \"Nerd looks like an ink blot.\"\n\n \n \n You glance back at him, a sinking feeling in your stomach forming. He grins back with a sneer, satisfied in your efforts. You glance up at the clock. Whatever you just did, you don't think it was the school's impact on you.\n\n \n\n This is not you. The thought arrives sudden and sharp. It was wrong.\n\n \n\n *But it felt good, didn’t it?*\n\n \n\n You briefly hear the bell ring, summoning you back to reality. As you pack up, in spite of your best efforts some part of you has to agree with that.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You look at the ink cartridge Manny has set on your desk. The black surface is dull, the pierced hole dark where the key went through. It sits there heavy with suggestion.\n\n \n\n Your hand twitches. The urge is there, hot and immediate. You want to hurl it into Dennis’s back. To smear the pages he’s scratching through, to show him his efforts are pointless.\n\n \n\n But instead, you grip the book a little tighter, keeping your hand away.\n\n \n\n Manny watches. The grin fades into a thin sneer. “What, too good for it?” he mutters under his breath.\n\n \n\n \"Got to get this work done,\" you mutter back. Manny shoots you a confused stare.\n\n \n\n You feel the testosterone surging through your body, as you now try to avoid both looking up at the clock and the ink cartridge on Manny's desk. Not to mention, Dennis, who you're eyes are drawn back to. He sits there, oblivious. Still writing, pencil scratching lines through equations. \n \n\n Looking around, you see the girls answering their questions on baking and washing. In spite of the content, they are trying to make do with what they are given. Even if the math in the questions is clearly aimed at a comprehension level way below their age. But with Dennis, he gets the opportunity. Whilst they are set up for failure. It infuriates you.\n\n Looking around, you see the girls sink further as the clock ticks slowly. They are suffering, barely awake. Some staring vacantly to an unseen horizon, not even present. And Dennis gets to write with immunity, whilst they are set up for failure. It infuriates you.\n\n \n \n\n You force your eyes back to the numbers. Fractions blur, but you scrawl them anyway, pushing the irritation down with every mark of the pen. Manny shakes his head, still smirking. The moment passes. Rogers drones on.\n\n \n\n The urge to punish Dennis fades. And with it, you feel shame begin to burn. Was that really you? That desire to put him in his place. Or was that some part of this school that you haven't uncovered yet.\n\n \n\n *Come on! You wanted to. Don’t pretend you didn’t.*\n\n \n\n For the rest of the lesson, you try to bury yourself in work, ignoring the glances you see Manny giving you from the corner of your eye. When the bell rings, he leaves without saying a word.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You quietly sigh. “Fine. I’ll do it.”\n\n \n\n “Do what?” he asks you, coldly.\n\n \n\n “Submit,” you reply.\n\n \n\n He raises an eyebrow, mockingly. “I’m not sure I understand.”\n\n \n\n You grit your teeth. “I’ll submit to you. Sir.”\n\n \n\n He gives you a smile of victory. “There. Wasn’t so hard now, was it?” \n\n \n\n He reaches into his pocket and takes out a key, placing it on your desk. “Here. You can come and go freely. If I feel you are slipping behind in my class, I will tell you to come by.”\n\n \n\n Not taking your eyes off him, you take the key and pocket it.\n\n \n\n “Now. You may leave.” He gestures to the door.\n\n \n\n Only pausing for the briefest moment, you gather up your belongings and rush towards the door. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I won’t,” you spit out. “Not in a million years.”\n\n \n\n Rogers looks down at you, his smile morphing into a sneer. “Fine. I hope you are fulfilled by the kind of the jobs a woman can find without a school diploma. How does stripping sound as career? I hear they’re hiring at Dicks.”\n\n \n\n He spins around and strides over to his desk, pulling out paperwork and scrawling furiously. “Get out,” he says without looking up. “And don’t bother with detention.”\n\n \n\n After only the slightest hesitation, you scramble up and grab your belongings. Not looking for a second at Mr. Rogers, you bolt out the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "After a long few minutes, the silence is broken as the door to the classroom swings open. Mr. Rogers strides in, glancing at you as he enters.\n\n \n\n “Ah, Miss. Phillips,” he says coldly. “So glad you could join me.”\n\n \n\n Rogers eyes you for a moment longer, then takes out a key and locks the door behind him. You watch as he walks over to his desk, standing behind it. His eyes momentarily roam over your body, lingering on your legs underneath the desk.\n\n \n\n “I’ll speak plainly, Miss. Phillips,” he tells you, returning to look at your face. “Your behaviour in class is unacceptable and your marks are well below a passing grade. Fortunately for you, my tutorage after school has proven effective.”\n\n \n\n He reaches underneath his desk and you hear a click. When his hands return you see an object resting on his palms. A bamboo school cane, complete with a curved handle.\n\n \n\n “It’s quite simple, Miss. Phillips. If you want me to forgive your exploits, and if you wish to pass this class, you will come over here, willingly and without question. And,” he pauses, with a relish for the drama. “Assume the position.”\n\n \n\n He taps the cane on the edge of his desk. You feel your heart sink as the situation crystallises for you. Your eyes linger on the cane, and the cold smile of your Maths tutor, as he stares back at you.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n You stare at him, feeling the conflict pumping through your body. Emily has to graduate, you think.\n\n \n\n *Is this the price you're willing to pay for it?*\n\n \n\n With a deep sigh, you push back your desk and stand on your heels. Your eyes from the cane in his hand to his icy smile. You know exactly what is in-store for you.\n\n \n\n Wordlessly, you move up to the desk. Rogers watches you from the other side, as you put your palms face down and lean over, feeling your skirt rise up your legs as you do so.\n\n \n\n Mr. Rogers watches you for a moment as you look up at him. Then he slowly walks around the desk. You begin to watch him move, but he shakes his head.\n\n \n\n “Face forward,” he says from behind you.\n\n \n\n You stare at the classroom wall behind the desk, but feel his eyes on your body. Conscious of how your skirt hem is tickling your buttocks, aware that your underwear must be at least partially exposed.\n\n \n\n “Move your legs wider,” he says. You feel his shoe prod at your Mary Jane heels. You do so, feeling your skirt rising even more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You shake your head. “No. There’s no way I’m doing that.”\n\n \n\n Rogers stares back at you, his cold smile not leaving his face. “Are you quite certain, Miss. Phillips?” he asks you. “The world can be an unforgiving place to women who fail to graduate from school.”\n\n \n\n You stare back at him, feeling the rage boil inside you. Emily must graduate, you think,\n\n \n\n *But is this the price you want to pay for it?*\n\n \n\n Pushing your chair back, you stand on your heels. “Unlock the door.”\n\n \n\n His smile slowly fades. “Very well,” he mutters. With a swift motion, he returns the cane to where he pulled it out. You hear a click as he fastens it underneath his desk.\n\n \n\n Not taking his eyes off you, he walks slowly over to the door. Purposefully he takes the key from his suit pocket, and turns it around in the lock, pulling the door open.\n\n \n\n “Good luck, Miss. Phillips,” he says as you walk to the door. “You may find that in future, your grades aren’t as high as you might expect.”\n\n \n\n You brush past him as you move past, shuddering as you do so. Your thoughts drift to Emily and how this will affect her, but you are glad to have escaped Rogers grasp. For now.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n WHACK!\n \n \n\n You feel a surge of pain pulsate out from your bare thigh, between where your socks end and where your underwear covers your bottom. You bite into your bottom lip, trying not to cry out.\n\n \n\n WHACK!\n\n \n\n Another strike from the cane lands on your skin, this time higher. You feel tears forming. You bite down harder on your lip.\n\n \n\n WHACK!\n\n \n\n The blow is higher still, falling across the fabric of your underwear. It’s not enough to take the sting out of the strike. You feel your buttocks radiate with heat. \n\n \n\n You tense up, waiting for another sting. But one doesn’t come. Silence hangs in the air.\n\n \n\n “Now Miss. Phillips,” you hear Rogers say from behind you. “Tell me. Will you continue to be a bad girl?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n \n <> \n \n \n \n You hold back your words for the longest moment, as thoughts bubble up in your mind. Whether it’s for ulterior motives or not, the pain ebbing from your thighs has touched you deep inside. “Spank me harder,” you whisper to him.\n\n \n\n “Spank you harder, what?” you hear Rogers ask, a cold tone to his voice.\n\n \n\n “Spank me harder, please,” you say, this time a little louder.\n\n \n\n “Please, what?”\n\n \n\n You gulp, as you strain to remain standing in this position. “Spank me harder please, sir.”\n\n \n\n A crack of the cane strikes against your bottom through your underwear, and this time Rogers is not holding back. You almost slip in your heels, feeling your palms growing sweaty and your balance perilous as you lean forward.\n\n \n\n Another blow. Then another. Each time the sudden rush of pain surges through your body. But with it comes a yearning for the next strike. A desire for more. A need to feel helpless and dominated by this man who has authority over you.\n\n \n\n You're getting off on it, aren't you?\n\n \n\n It’s a question no more when the final strike lands and you hear yourself moan with arousal.\n\n \n\n “You may stand up now, Miss. Phillips,” you hear Rogers tell you.\n\n \n\n And just like that, it’s all over.\n\n \n\n And with some disappointment, I bet\n\n \n\n You push yourself back away from the desk, brushing your thighs with your fingers. You wince. The bruising is forming and it’s not small.\n\n \n\n The sound of metal scraping across the desk takes your attention and you look up to see Rogers pushing a key towards you. He smiles, a degree of satisfaction on his face. “Take this. My door will be open to you. Anytime you feel you need extra lessons.”\n\n \n\n You cautiously pick up the key and put it away. Rogers watches you, then sits down at his desk and takes out some paperwork.\n\n \n\n “You may go,” he tells you. “I’ll be seeing you, Miss. Phillips. I look forward to it.”\n\n \n\n Without saying anything, you walk to the door and unlock it. Your thighs and bum throb as you walk. What you try to push out of your mind is the other sensations in that region, which are contributing more to your struggles to walk than the pain.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You try to consider what you think Rogers wants to hear. Thoughts rise up inside your mind, each one making you wince and grimace as you consider speaking them out loud. “Spank me harder,” you mutter.\n\n \n\n “Spank you harder, what?” you hear Rogers ask, a cold tone to his voice.\n\n \n\n “Just... spank me harder,” you try, uncertainty in your voice.\n\n \n\n “Ask nicely,\" you hear Rogers say. \"And remember who you are referring to.”\n\n \n\n You grit your teeth, straining as you try to remain standing in this position. “Just do it harder,” you whine.\n\n \n\n A crack of the cane strikes against your bottom through your underwear. This time, you notice the force is tempered. You barely have to push against the desk to remain upright.\n\n \n\n Another blow. Then another. But with each one, there's less effort and passion behind the strokes.\n\n \n\n Then, just like that, it's over. “You may stand up now, Miss. Phillips,” you hear Rogers tell you.\n\n \n\n You push yourself back away from the desk, brushing your thighs with your fingers. The bruising is swelling, but the pain is minor.\n\n \n\n “For a moment, I thought you were finally applying some degree of enthusiasm to something\", you hear Rogers say as he walks around the desk and stares back at you. \"A pity. But no matter.\"\n \n\n \"That is the punishment for failing my class,” Rogers says to you. “I will overlook this transgression once. But don’t test my patience again.”\n\n \n\n Rogers walks over to the classroom door and unlocks it, opening it wide. “You may go.”\n\n \n\n You walk slowly over to the door, your legs shaking with both nerves and the pain. He smiles thinly at you as you pass him, but says nothing more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I’ll be good,” you say, holding back tears.\n\n \n\n “You’ll be good, what?” you hear him ask.\n\n \n\n “I’ll be good, sir,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n “Very well,” you hear Rogers say. He walks around the desk, meeting your eyes as you look up, still bent over.\n\n \n\n “You may stand,” he tells you, returning his cane underneath his desk.\n\n \n\n You push yourself back and stand up, cautiously running your fingers over the bruising that is forming. You yelp when they touch the inflamed areas.\n\n \n\n “That is the punishment for failing my class,” Rogers says to you. “I will overlook this transgression once. But don’t test my patience again.”\n\n \n\n Rogers walks over to the classroom door and unlocks it, opening it wide. “You may go.”\n\n \n\n You walk slowly over to the door, your legs shaking with both nerves and the pain. He smiles thinly at you as you pass him, but says nothing more.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I won’t,” you manage to yelp back at him through gritted teeth.\n\n \n\n WHACK!\n\n \n\n The strike lands directly across your buttocks with a ferocity Rogers hadn’t displayed before. You squeal as the pain sears up. You hold back the tears, barely.\n\n \n\n Then, silence. A moment passes. Then another. You hear the sound of Rogers shoes walking around the table, and you let out a sigh.\n\n \n\n He puts the cane back underneath the desk and meets your eyes. A cold satisfied smile rests on his face.\n\n \n\n “You’ll grow used to it,” he says to you. “Enjoy it, even. Because I’m sure I’ll be seeing you a lot in detention.”\n\n \n\n You shake your head, your trembling legs almost giving way as you still hunch over your teacher’s desk.\n\n \n\n “Pity,” Rogers tells you. “But I am a man of my word. Stand-up.”\n\n \n\n You push yourself back from the desk. Your fingers brush against the backs of your thighs. The pain is almost unbearable, but you refuse to show it to Rogers.\n\n \n\n “You may leave,” he tells you, walking over to the door and unlocking it. Walking is painful, but you try not to show it. \n\n \n\n “Let’s not have a repeat in my lessons, Miss. Phillips,” he says to you as you walk out the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Charlton School - Maths Room**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Maths_Room.png]\n\n \nWalls are covered with formula and maths equations. Single wooden desks are spaced out evenly, each weathered but free of graffiti. A sturdy desk rests in front of a sturdy blackboard, with faded chalk maths questions etched into it.\n\n \n\n You enter the maths room, quietly and quickly. You check to make sure it’s empty. When satisfied, you close the door behind you and look around.\n\n \n\n The eerie silence keeps you alert. The only sound comes from the clock above the blackboard, its ominous ticking marking each second you spend in danger.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You stare up at the clock, letting the magical energies inside you bubble up and spread across your body.\n\n \n\n With the time to focus, immediately the curse becomes clear. Yellow tentacles made of the arcane arts writhe out of the clock, each swaying around the room as if trying to find a target.\n\n \n\n You keep from their reach, backing up against the wall of the classroom.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n You stare up at the clock, trying to summon the magical energies inside you. But try as you might, nothing comes.\n\n \n\n The quiet ticking of the clock continues to fill the room. You see nothing more.\n\n \n\n The realisation comes quickly. In order to use magic, you need to be a girl.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n Closing your eyes, you reach out to the clock with your mind. The tentacles appear to sense you, suddenly diverting their attention from the room and towards you as your mind moves towards the clock.\n\n \n\n As your mind edges towards it, one skims past you. You feel a twinge of vacancy in your brain. Your concentration threatens to slip.\n\n \n\n Regathering your focus, you push forward, slipping your projection around the tentacle's frenzied movements. Then you reach your goal. Bright and warm, the magic from the curse crackles around the clock. \n\n \n\n \n “I cause this object with power beyond its power,” you whisper. “Unseen and unheard, its effects will be felt by all but me.”\n\n \n\n The embers of magic crack and crystallise, then fuse together at the heart of the clock in a new shape. The frenzy of tentacles then subsides. One brushes past you. It does nothing.\n\n \n “I cause this object with power beyond its power,” you whisper. “Unseen and unheard, its effects will be felt by none.”\n\n \n\n The energies within the clock seem to crackle. The tentacles thrash out, then begin to fade. Within moments, there is nothing but a kernel of inert magic at the centre of the timepiece.\n\n \n \n <>\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

You briefly search for other keys for Charlton School, but strangely you can’t find another one.\n\n As you do so, you notice the next key on the ring is marked up as ‘Charlton School - Business Studies Room’.

I assure you our assessment during her tenure at Charlton found that her skills evident in her business studies exams made her a good match for your needs. Her reluctance to engage with the ‘softer skills’ of the role (i.e. your use of the word ‘frigid’) is a surprise to all the staff that taught her.\n\n \n\n Attached is a number of candidates from our current senior year. If any of these candidates prove interesting, we would be more than happy to set up an interview in advance of The Prom as a replacement for the role ready for when they graduate.\n \n \n\n Regards,\n\n \n\n Peter Stitch,\n\n Headmaster, Charlton Upper School\n\n \n\n As you finish reading the memo, a sound from outside the office makes you jump.

In her short time at Charlton, she has already been invited to Mrs. DeBussy’s after school club. She seems willing to do what is necessary to achieve results. It is our assessment that with a strong hand to guide her, she would be a compliant employee that would suit your needs.\n\n \n **Candidate summary:** Miss Phillips has shown resilience to direction in Mrs. DeBussy’s class. Further education would be necessary should she be a desired candidate for the role.

For once, the system seems to respond to your work. You lean back, the rare feeling of victory settling over you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n It takes effort, but your concentration holds. One fix, then another. You're in the zone - methodical, focused, capable. By the time you glance at the clock, you've dealt with two significant problems. Thompson might even be pleased.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You manage to get to the bottom of one of the persistent issues. It isn't pretty, but it works. That's all that matters right now. One bug down. Too many left to go.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You make a little progress - some logs understood, a stack trace followed - but the solution's just out of reach. You've started the work, but it's going to take another round to get through it properly.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You think you're making progress, but it's slow. Really slow. You've covered the basics, maybe laid some groundwork, but the solution still looks miles away. You're starting to lose confidence.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You try. You really do. But it's no good. You can't think straight. The logs make no sense. The screen seems to mock you. You eventually stop typing altogether and just… sit. Completely lost.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You decide to put work aside for the moment and see if you can find something to help you understand what’s going on.\n\n \n\n Your first attempts display pages of results about what you knew about magic before that amulet came into your life. Wikipedia pages on its place in fiction, new age movements selling crystals, pseudoscience articles on affirmations and social media content from bored teenagers.\n\n \n\n Trying to narrow your results, you decide to focus your search around Charlton and related topics.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n Unsurprisingly, Charlton has little presence online. Search results mention some of the local businesses and brief summaries of the history of the town that are little more than Wikipedia stubs. The town has existed in one form or another for hundreds of years, serving as a small farming community before the industrial revolution caused it to shrink to little more than a hamlet. \n\n \n\n One thing that does draw your attention is the town being referenced in a history of rural counterculture movements of the 1960s. The surrounding fields and valleys were a hot spot for impromptu gatherings of pagans, hippies and flower children. Free love festivals used the town as a base, filling the sleepy town with Volkswagen vans and the shops and hotel with children of the revolution. \n\n \n\n Then, just as the ‘60s ended, results fall off. The only references to Charlton between then and now are the businesses, the school, the shops. The picture of a sleepy town, untouched by modernity.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n The results from combining Charlton and magic brings up a number of pages detailing the town’s history with counterculture movements and pagan festivals in the ‘60s. Whilst noteworthy, nothing strikes you as being relevant, or indeed real. Even when you take into consideration that ‘real’ to you means something very different than before.\n\n \n\n That is until a result stands out. You click on a result page buried in the articles about the town’s history titled, “Gladys’ Shop of Curiosities.” You are taken through to a black page, full of words and graphics that look like a website designed in the 1990s.\n\n \n\n Designed for the curious mind, Gladys’ offers services and advice to make your heart’s desire come to life.\n\n \n\n The page is littered with badly taken photographs of trinkets and jewellery with vague descriptions of what they are. You notice that a few of them are very similar to the amulet that your sister gave you. \n\n \n\n You also see an address at the bottom of the page. The shop apparently is on Avian Lane, wedged between McTafey’s bar and a block of apartments. Strangely enough, it’s almost opposite where Jennifer lives. You are certain that you’ve never seen it before.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You step around Annie's new desk, taking in the clutter and chaotic mess that is Annie's filing system. Folders are sprawled out over the desk. Brightly coloured post-it notes line the edges of the monitor. A dull mouse is livened up by the glittery pink mouse mat it rests on.\n\n \n\n Booting up her computer, you check her inbox. Half a dozen emails came in requesting meetings with Thompson overnight. You check his calendar only to find large blocks are blocked out. The subject blocked from view.\n\n \n\n Before you can schedule the first meeting, the phone interrupts you. \"Good morning, Thompson's Repairs,\" you say, echoing the words you've heard from Annie. \"Mr. Thompson's office. How might I help you?\"\n\n \n\n Over the next thirty minutes, you try to answer emails in-between the constant calls. Every time you answer one email, two more arrive. Most of them are minor. Mundane.\n\n \n\n “Hey darling, can I get a phone call in with Tucker this afternoon? Need to have a chat about the bill that hit my doormat today.”\n“Your boss free for golf Friday?”\n“Can you ask the owner if he's interested in changing his stationary order?”\n \n\n Even the phone calls feel off. It's mostly Thompson's friends and business acquaintances looking for him, but at the sound of your voice they begin to chat. It almost goes without saying that it's exclusively men.\n\n \n\n You’re halfway through scheduling a lunch meeting when you hear boots on the carpet.\n\n \n\n Gordon appears in the doorway. \"Annie,\" he says, not waiting for a reply. \"Where's Phillips?\"\n\n \n\n \"I'm not sure,\" you feign, trying to think of an excuse.\n\n \n\n Gordon grunts. \"Need someone to do my receipts. No one's on reception.\"\n\n \n\n You try not to grimace. \"Can I help?\"\n\n \n\n He shakes his head. \"Not your job, anymore. Phillips is slacking. Need to have a word with Thompson. He free?\"\n\n \n\n You eye him with concern. If you don't act now, you'll risk Thompson's wrath. Not to mention his anger at you not showing up to work.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n \n [Saucy Secretary] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n The office is quieter now. The phone stopped ringing five minutes ago, and you’ve just started sorting through calendar when the door from reception swings open.\n\n \n\n Dan barrels in, phone in one hand, sunglasses in the other. It doesn't matter that it's permanently overcast in Charlton. “Annie,” he announces. “Is there a reason I just spent thirty minutes driving to a meeting only to discover that my phone thinks our client lives in a parking lot?”\n\n \n \n You blink, caught off guard. “I haven’t touched it,” you say.\n\n \n\n He stops, dramatically sighs, and slides his sunglasses up onto his head. Despite the dim lighting.\n\n \n\n \"Of course you didn't,\" he replies. \"You don't need to worry your pretty little head with anything other than Thompson's diary. What I need is for Phillips to explain what the hell they think they're doing. Where are they?\"\n\n \n\n \"I'm not sure,\" you reply, trying to assess the situation.\n\n \n\n “Well,\" he says, dramatically pulling his glasses down to look over the rim. \"If you see them, tell them I’m grabbing lunch with Thompson. Got some thoughts to share.\"\n\n \n\n He starts toward the corridor, still muttering to himself.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n \n [Saucy Secretary] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n You are working away at the front desk when you hear the bell chime out in reception. You leap up and rush through the door to see Emily standing in the entrance, looking back at you.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Emily eyes you sheepishly. \"Hey,\" she says quietly. \"Annie, right? I'm Emily. I'm supposed to start an internship today.\"\n\n \n\n The internship...\n\n \n\n Emotions flutter inside you. Shame. Embarrassment. An odd sensation where your mind is trying to make sense of what feels like a dream. But you push it all down. \"Sure,\" you reply. \"Take a seat.\"\n\n \n\n You gesture to the visitors chair. Emily puts her bag neatly underneath the reception desk and sits down, waiting expectedly.\n\n \n Emily grins, strolling around the counter with confidence and purpose. She tosses her bag behind the counter and leans casually against the computer. \"Hey! Annie, right? I love your dress. Where did you get it?\"\n\n \n\n \"Emily...\" you begin, but realisation hits you. The internship...\n\n \n\n You take a gulp. \"Evans,\" you mutter.\n\n \n\n \"I didn't know that sold skirts that short,\" Emily whispers to you, grinning. \"But if you've got it, you might as well flaunt it.\"\n\n \n\n \"You're here for the internship?\" you ask her, playing for time.\n\n \n\n She shrugs. \"I mean, I'd much rather get your advice on how to find bargains at Evans. But sure. Where do we begin?\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Emily smiles meekly at you, still feeling uncomfortable being here. She walks around the desk and pops her school bag down, then hangs awkwardly off to the side.\n\n \n\n \"So. What are we doing today?\" she asks.\n\n \n Emily grins at the sight of you, but strolls in with confidence and purpose. She tosses her bag behind the counter and leans casually against the computer. \"Hey Annie! Another day of manning phones and talking to beefy tradesmen. That reminds me, I don't suppose Dan is around, is he?\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes wander. You move the mouse, bringing the monitor back to life, trying to make a point. \"Oh,\" she exclaims. \"Right. Work.\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You are working the Thompson's inbox, responding to his friends flirtatious emails, when Thompson's door creaks open. You glance up and see his face in the shadows, looking at you.\n\n \n\n \"Need you in my office. Now.\"\n\n \n\n You stop what you're doing and stand up, knowing full well not to risk Thompson’s wrath. You step up to the door and open it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n The day draws to a close.\n\n \n\n You shut down the computer, logging out of systems and wiping down the dusty monitor. You glance over to Thompson's office and see light seeping out from underneath the door. He's still working.\n\n \n\n Which is just as well, as Annie didn't give you her set of keys.\n \n \n\n Flicking off the desk lamp, you gather your belongings and exit, grateful for the end of the working day.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

Girls wouldn’t understand. Bit advanced, that one.\"\n\n \n\n She offers him a saccharine smile. \"Of course.\"\n\n \n\n Then Dan’s eyes land on you. His grin widens. \"Well, well. Look who it is.

And Friday afternoons are so dull.”\n\n \n\n Annie looks back at you, then to Dan. Her smile fades. “If Mr. Thompson sees her slacking off, it’ll go straight back to the school.\"\n\n \n\n \n “Don’t worry about Thompson,” he replies. Then his voice drops, just a little. \"Otherwise, I might find myself in his office. Talking about my unfavourable first impressions. Be a shame to spill the beans.\"\n\n “Don’t worry about Thompson,” he replies. Then his voice drops, just a little. \"Otherwise, I might find myself in his office. Talking about how her ’s been doing such a bad job lately. Shame, really.\"\n\n \n\n He grins at you, lingering a second too long, the breath of alcohol invading your face. “What do you say, Phillips? Fancy keeping me occupied?\"\n \n \n Another Friday afternoon. Another slow, humming stretch behind the reception desk.\n\n \n\n You're halfway through updating the calendar when the bell above the door jingles. Dan strolls in, his cologne strong enough to mask the stench of alcohol on his breath. He shoots you a grin that you’ve come to recognise all too well. \"Afternoon, Phillips,\" he says, swaggering toward the counter. \"Fancy keeping me company today?\"\n\n \n\n He leans on the desk, watching you with a gleam in his eye, waiting.\n\n \n\n Annie glances over from the filing cabinet but says nothing. You’re not sure if she’s giving you space - or leaving you to fend for yourself.\n\n \n\n The office seems to quieten. The ball’s in your court.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n \n \n [Saucy Secretary] <>\n\n <>\n\n [Saucy Secretary] Decline Dan's offer - *Something compels you to positively respond to him*\n\n \n \n \n [Dutiful Doer] <>\n\n <>\n\n [Dutiful Doer] Decline Dan's offer - *It makes you feel queasy even thinking about defying him*\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n\n \n \n You lean back in your chair ever so slightly, lips parting into a smile. You can’t help it - not anymore. Your instinct is to smile sweetly, rely on your charm, your curves, your ability to make men feel like they’re winning.\n\n \n\n \"I really should concentrate on my internship,\" you say with a gentle, playful lilt. \"But… if there’s something I can help with… anything at all. Just let me know. I’m here to help.\"\n\n \n\n Dan’s eyes light up instantly. \"Oh, I can think of a few things,\" he says with a grin, eyes slowly trailing down your body. His gaze lingers, and without thinking, you arch your back just a little. Just enough.\n\n \n\n \"Tell you what,\" he says, snapping his fingers. \"Daddy needs a coffee. That liquid lunch turned into a solid deal. Gotta close it out if I want that commission. And you know I need that bump - got some lucky ladies to wine and dine.\"\n\n \n\n The words escape your lips before you even realise you’re saying them. \"Lucky girls.\"\n\n \n\n Dan laughs. \"Bring it when you can, sweetheart.\"\n\n \n\n He walks off, smug and satisfied.\n\n \n\n Annie gives a low whistle. \"Well. You sure know how to wrap them around your finger. That’s the key to success around here.\"\n\n \n\n Then, quieter, more solemn: \"Just... know where your line is, okay? It’s hard to walk back once you’ve crossed over it.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, unsure whether she’s warning you, or herself. Getting back to your tasks, you lose yourself in calendar entries and extension numbers until you remember Dan’s coffee order. You make a quick run to Fresh Pot, then bring it to the office.\n\n \n\n Dan’s eyes are on your legs the entire time.\n\n \n\n \"Thanks, sweetheart,\" he says, smirking.\n\n \n\n \"Anytime,\" you say, flashing a small smile as you turn and walk away, fully aware of his eyes following your every step.\n\n \n You flash Dan a sweet smile as he leans in with that familiar grin.\n\n \n\n \"I’ve still got work to do for my internship,\" you say lightly. \"But I’ll pop by later. I want to hear all about that big commission you’re getting.\"\n\n \n\n Dan grins. \"Oh, I’ll be happy to show you how big it is.\" He winks, then walks off into the office.\n\n \n\n Later, you swing by his desk with a coffee in hand. He launches straight into a boastful rundown of the deal he landed, his voice loud and animated. He’s riding high, talking about connections, commissions, and Charlton’s high society.\n\n \n\n \"You should come by the country club sometime,\" he says. \"I’ve spent a chunk of that bonus on some... premium equipment. You’ve got to see how I use it.\"\n\n \n\n You cringe inwardly, but the compulsion tugs at your instincts. “I’d love to see you in action,” you reply, giving him a smile. \n\n \n\n He laughs, clearly pleased. “Look forward to it.”\n\n \n\n You leave the office with his eyes still following you.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You nod automatically. You don’t think. You just... do what you’re told. That’s what’s expected of you here. He asked. You accepted. Simple.\n\n \n\n Annie raises an eyebrow but doesn’t say anything.\n\n \n\n You follow Dan through the door to the office, walking behind him as he sits down at his desk. He gestures next to him and you lean against it, noting your stocking-clad legs are uncomfortably close to him, your short skirt riding up just enough to make you hyperaware of yourself. Vulnerable. Exposed.\n\n \n\n \"Let me tell you how things really work around here,\" Dan begins, stretching back in his chair. \"You want to get ahead in business? It’s not about performance. It’s about relationships.\"\n\n \n\n He gestures vaguely as he talks, his eyes occasionally flicking to your legs.\n\n \n\n \"People aren’t complicated. They’ve got needs. Once you figure out how to meet them, you’ve got them in the palm of your hand. And the ones to pay most attention to? The basic needs.\"\n\n \n\n His gaze lowers again, across your legs. Lingering. His tongue runs across his lips.\n\n \n\n \"It’s important to know your place though,\" he adds, looking back at your face. \"I’m an alpha. Top of the food chain. And a receptionist? She’s there to help me do my job. Support. Obey. You understand that, right?\"\n\n \n\n You nod, finding yourself taking in his words. Not because you want to. Because you have to. Your instincts push you to remember every word he says.\n\n \n\n \"You’ll fit in nicely,\" Dan says, satisfied.\n\n \n\n The conversation is interrupted by the sound of a door slamming open, the frame bouncing off the wall as it hits it. Almost immediately, Mr. Thompson strides out. His eyes land on the two of you immediately.\n\n \n\n Dan straightens up, slamming his hands onto his keyboard, pretending to work. But you don’t have time - or learning reflexes - to react. As Thompson's eyes fall on you, his scowl deepens. \n\n \n\n \"What do you think you’re doing, young lady?” he asks, but doesn’t wait for a reply. “Just because I’m not paying you doesn’t mean you can treat this as an afternoon off. This is your chance to prove you can hold down a job. Not to bag a husband.\"\n\n \n\n His glare could cut glass. \"Mr. Stitch will be hearing about this.\"\n\n \n\n He strides across the office and out into reception. “Annie!” you hear him bark. “Draw up a memo to Charlton School!” \n\n \n\n Dan mutters something under his breath and starts typing furiously, his bravado evaporated. \"We’ll chat later,\" he says, not looking up.\n\n \n\n You slink away, cheeks burning, returning to the reception. Annie glances your way as you walk in. She gives you a small, sympathetic smile, but says nothing.\n\n \n\n You sit back down and answer the next call, the dial tone almost drowning out the shame burning beneath your skin.\n \n \n You find yourself beside Dan’s desk again, exactly where he likes you - leaning in, listening. He doesn’t have to ask anymore. You’ve learned to come when expected.\n\n \n\n Dan continues his usual spiel, half lecture, half self-congratulation. He tells you how the business runs on people like him. How success is about knowing who to please. How a good receptionist doesn’t question. Just listens, supports. Obeys.\n\n \n\n \"This place would fall apart without me,\" he mutters as he scrolls through his emails. \"Everyone else? Replaceable. Except the ones who know how to play the game.\"\n\n \n\n You nod along. It’s not enthusiasm. It’s instinct now. He talks. You listen.\n\n \n\n Then the door slams open. \"Slacking off again, Phillips?\" Thompson’s voice booms across the office.\n\n \n\n You jolt upright, but it’s too late.\n\n \n\n \"This isn’t a dating service,\" he barks. \"Leave your flirting to your own time and get back to work, before I phone the school and take back this opportunity I’m giving you.\"\n\n \n\n You retreat quickly, cheeks burning, back to your desk. You weren’t flirting. You were just following instructions. Just doing what you were told.\n\n \n\n But that doesn’t seem to matter.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n \n You give a small nod. “Sure, that would be nice.”\n\n \n\n Dan walks toward the office. He doesn’t wait for you - he assumes you’ll be behind him. You follow, walking over to his desk as he sits down and gestures to the spot next to him. You lean against it, legs crossed, skirt riding up slightly as you settle in. His grin widens.\n\n \n\n \"Let me tell you how things really work around here,\" Dan begins, stretching back like a man completely at ease. \"Success isn’t about spreadsheets. It’s about people. It’s about knowing what someone wants. And making sure they get it.\"\n\n \n\n He talks as if he’s giving you a masterclass. “The secret”, he says, “is knowing how to listen. How to follow orders. How to support those of us who make things happen. You can do that, can’t you, sweetheart?”\n\n \n\n You offer him a polite smile, holding back your thoughts on his patronising tone.\n\n \n\n \"People have needs,\" he adds, his eyes drifting over your legs before settling on your face. \"You meet those needs, and you get ahead. Annie’s been pretty good at keeping up with that, but there’s still some room for improvement. There’s room for you to take her spot, if you know how to play the game, love.”\n\n \n\n “Just remember your place. You’d be surprised how many people fall over when they get too cocky. I’m an alpha. Top of the food chain. And you? You help me do my job. That’s what receptionists are for.\"\n\n \n\n Once again, you nod. Sensing the break in the conversation, you seize the opportunity to try and gain at least some value from him. “Say Dan, I was wondering if you could tell me about -”\n\n \n\n The moment is shattered when Thompson’s office door swings open with a crash. He strides into the room, eyes immediately locking onto you both.\n\n \n\n Dan jolts upright, pretending to be buried in work. But you’re caught. His eyes flick to you, solely. He flares his nostrils.\n\n \n\n \"What do you think you’re doing, young lady?\" Thompson snaps. \"Just because I’m not paying you doesn’t mean you can treat this like an afternoon off. This is your chance to prove you can hold down a job. Not to bag a husband.\"\n\n \n\n “I wasn’t…” you begin, but his glare is enough to stop you in your tracks.\n\n \n\n “Save it,” he says. His glare is scalding. \"Mr. Stitch will be hearing about this.\"\n\n \n\n Without waiting for a reply, he storms out toward reception. \"Annie! Draw up a memo to Charlton School!\"\n\n \n\n Dan avoids your gaze, suddenly far more interested in his keyboard. \"We’ll chat later,\" he mutters.\n\n \n\n You return to reception. Annie gives you a small, understanding smile, but nothing more. You silently sit down at the reception desk and take the next call, feeling your cheeks burning red.\n \n \n Once again, you find yourself accepting his offer and fall in beside Dan’s desk in the office. You take your usual spot, leaning against the side of his desk while he talks.\n\n \n\n Without small talk, Dan continues to tell you about how to succeed in the corporate world. You smile at the right moments, nod when he looks for a reply. But continually trying to find someway to interject and get something of value from him. And all the while your eyes flick back to the door to Thompson’s office, listening for any signs of activity.\n\n \n\n Dan is mid-rant about his latest deal, but you gently interrupt. \"Hey Dan, could you tell me a bit about how Charlton puts forward interns here?\"\n\n \n\n Dan glances around, then leans in slightly. \"There’s a selection process,\" he says, quieter than usual. \"Usually it’s the ones doing well in Business Studies. Thompson’s very particular on - \"\n\n \n\n The door to Thompson’s office slams open. You flinch.\n\n \n\n Thompson strides out, his eyes landing on you immediately. \"Slacking off again, Phillips? This isn’t a dating service. Leave your flirting to your own time and get back to work before I phone the school and take back this opportunity I’m giving you.\"\n\n \n\n Dan snaps to attention, hammering nonsense into his keyboard like a guilty schoolboy.\n\n \n\n You retreat back to reception, face burning. Annie catches your eye briefly, but doesn’t say a word. You slide into your chair and answer the next call, the weight of Thompson’s words still pressing on your shoulders.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n \n You offer Dan a polite but firm smile. “Thanks, but I should really concentrate on my internship.”\n\n \n\n He raises an eyebrow, clearly not expecting resistance. “Come on, don’t be like that. It’s just a chat. Bit of friendly advice.”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “I’m here to work. That’s what I need to focus on.”\n\n \n\n Dan sighs dramatically, pulling back from the counter. “You’re not going to get far thinking like that. Receptionists are ten a penny. Anyone can answer a phone. The real trick is personal relationships. That’s what matters.”\n\n \n\n \n \n \"Something your doesn’t understand either.” Dan gives you a thin smile. “Which reminds me, I found another bug in the system this morning. Stopping me closing out my latest sale. Now that I don’t have anything to keep me occupied this afternoon, I might pop into Thompson’s office. See if he's free for a little chat… about your .”\n\n \n\n He walks out of the reception, the door closing behind him. You feel the tension settle over you like a fog.\n\n \n\n Annie steps over quietly, smiling warmly. “You did good,” she says. “The men around here… they’re used to getting their way. But sometimes it’s good for them not to.”\n\n \n\n She pauses, eyes distant for a beat. “I wish I had been more like you when I started.”\n\n \n\n Then her smile returns. “Come on. Let me show you how the job booking system works.”\n\n \n\n You return to your desk, the moment behind you. Although the unease lingers. Annie walks you through how to schedule jobs for Gordon and Clive. A little later, the office door slams open and Thompson strides out. He looks at you, then to Annie. “She settling in?”\n\n \n\n Annie nods. “She’s learning fast.”\n\n \n\n “Good,” Thompson replies. “Glad to see someone in your family has a work ethic. Speaking of - Annie, send me the leads report from yesterday. Dan says the system’s still not giving him what he needs.”\n \n\n He returns to looking at you, his narrowed eyes locking on to yours. “Your is on thin ice, young lady. Take my advice - don’t be like them.”\n\n \n\n He strides out. Annie meets your gaze, but says nothing. After a moment, she returns to showing you the booking system. Time slips away and before you know it, the afternoon has passed by.\n\n \n Dan stands up. “You remind me of your ,” he says flatly. “Same stubborn attitude.”\n\n \n\n He smirks. “Maybe I’ll go check if Thompson’s free. Wouldn’t hurt to bring up a few things. You know, professional concerns about our latest intern.”\n\n \n\n Before you can speak, Annie steps in. “If you do that,” she says calmly, “I’ll let Thompson know how many clients really attend those long lunches at the Charlton Hotel.”\n\n \n \n Dan freezes, eyes narrowing. Annie leans in towards him, her voice dropping to a whisper. “You might know how to talk to him, but who do you think he really listens to?”\n\n \n\n Anger quickly rises up on his face. For a moment, you fear what he’s going to do. But he releases it with a scoff. “Fine,” he says through clenched teeth. “I’ve got deals to close out anyway. Real work.”\n\n \n\n He stalks off back into the office. The door closing quietly behind him.\n\n \n\n Annie turns back to you with a smile. “You did good,” she says. “The men around here… they’re used to getting their way. But sometimes it’s good for them not to.”\n\n \n\n She pauses, eyes distant for a beat. “I wish I had been more like you when I started.”\n\n \n\n Then, snapping back to cheerful: “Come on. Let me show you how the job booking system works.”\n\n \n\n You return to your seat and try to settle back into the rhythm of the work. Annie walks you through how to schedule jobs for Gordon and Clive. A little later, the office door slams open and Thompson strides out. He looks at you, then to Annie. “She settling in?”\n\n \n\n Annie nods. “She’s learning fast.”\n\n \n\n “Good,” Thompson replies. “Glad to see someone in your family has a work ethic.\"\n\n \n\n He exits without another word. Annie meets your eyes again, but says nothing. After a moment, she returns to showing you the booking system. Time slips away and before you know it, the afternoon has passed by.\n\n \n \n You straighten your back and offer a polite but firm response. “Thanks, but I still want to focus on my internship.”\n\n \n\n He exhales sharply, trying not to let the irritation show. “Receptionists are ten a penny, you know. You’d get further if you thought about long-term relationships, not how to answer calls.”\n\n \n\n \n \n He crosses his arms. “Still, there’s some lingering bugs in the system that I need to flag. Stuff that’s stopping me closing deals.”\n\n \n\n He eyes you as he steps away. “Might have a little word with Thompson this afternoon. Just to make sure he’s aware of the ongoing issues.”\n\n \n\n The door to the office shuts behind him. You let out a small breath you didn’t realise you were holding. Annie gives you a small nod. “Good choice,” she says. “Keep him at arms length. It’s healthy. For him and you. Alright. Let’s make sure Clive doesn’t get double-booked again.”\n\n \n\n You slide into the afternoon’s tasks, grateful for the structure. \n\n \n\n Later, the office door swings open. Thompson strides out, eyes scanning the reception. “Still working out?” he asks Annie.\n\n \n\n “Better than I did,” Annie replies.\n\n \n\n Thompson nods curtly. “Dan says the system’s throwing out bad data again. Pull out the latest reports.” He looks at you. “Your doesn’t deserve the money I pay them.”\n\n \n\n He leaves without another word. Annie smiles politely at you, then returns to walking you through your work.\n\n \n Dan smirks. “Same attitude as your sibling. Thought they could get by on their own too.”\n\n \n\n “She’s doing a good job,” Annie says to him, a hint of a warning in her tone. “Don’t you think, Daniel?”\n\n \n\n He grits his teeth, then wordlessly walks through the office door.\n\n \n\n Annie turns back to you, smiling. “Good call,” she says quietly. “Men like him don’t like being told no. But that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t hear it.”\n\n \n\n She trails off, thoughtful, then smiles. “Come on. Calendar work is backing up.”\n\n \n\n You slide into the afternoon’s tasks, grateful for the structure. Later, the office door swings open. Thompson strides out, eyes scanning the reception. “Still working out?” he asks Annie.\n\n \n\n “She’s learning fast,” Annie replies.\n\n \n\n Thompson nods once. “Let’s hope it sticks. I’ve had enough of that family coasting.”\n\n \n\n He moves on without another word. Annie returns to her task like nothing happened.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n \n \n The day draws to a close.\n\n \n\n Annie walks you through how to shut down the systems - logging out of the appointments software, powering down the dusty monitor, unplugging the temperamental printer. You follow her lead carefully, mirroring each step.\n\n \n\n She hands you the key to the front door, watching with a smile as you turn the lock.\n\n \n\n You glance over. \"How did I do?\"\n\n \n The day draws to a close.\n\n \n\n You move through the routine with practiced ease - shutting down the appointments software, powering off the monitor, locking the front door with a quick twist of the key.\n\n \n\n You turn to Annie. \"How did I do today?\"\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \"You did good,\" Annie says. \"Picked up the basics quickly. It’s admin work, sure. But it’s important to get right. And you’re picking it up well. I’ll be sure to sing your praises when I write my report for the school.\"\n\n \n\n She leans slightly against the desk. \"And the way you handled Dan? Impressive. Men like that are one of the biggest challenges in an office. Give them too little, they make your life miserable. Give them too much and...\"\n\n \n\n She trails off, the smile fading. For a moment she looks far away. \"Well. Let’s just say they start expecting things.\"\n\n \n\n You smile politely, nodding, but the thoughts twist inside. You didn’t handle Dan. Not really. You were compelled to flirt, to lean in, to charm him. Worse still, it felt good. Powerful. Until you realised what that power might cost you. \n\n \n\n You shudder at the thought of what Dan might expect next time... and whether you could even say no.\n\n \n\n Annie waves her hand in front of your face, bringing you out of your thoughts. “Time to go, daydreamer. Have a good night. See you next week!”\n\n \n \"You did good,\" Annie says. “Getting the hang of it. I’ll make sure the school knows how well you’re doing.”\n\n \n\n \"And Dan? You’re handling him well. Keep walking that line, but don’t go too far. That kind of man always wants more.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, offering a practiced smile. But inside, you wish it was a choice. The flirting, the posture, the tone. It came too naturally. You don’t even think about doing it. You just do.\n\n \n\n And worst of all? You’re not sure you’d stop if Dan ever decided he wanted more.\n\n \n\n Annie interrupts your thoughts. “That’s a wrap. Have a good night. See you next week!”\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n \n The day draws to a close.\n\n \n\n Annie walks you through how to shut down the systems - logging out of the appointments software, powering down the dusty monitor, unplugging the temperamental printer.

Good instincts.\"\n\n \n\n You grimace, sensing the \"but\" coming before she even says it.\n\n \n\n \"But Thompson wasn’t happy,\" she admits. \"He saw you hanging around with Dan. Sent a note to the school. Said you were slacking off. Spending your time with the men in the office, not working.\"\n\n \n\n You feel heat rise in your cheeks. \"Not all men. Just Dan. And I was responding to his request.\"\n\n \n\n \"I know,\" Annie replies, soft but firm. \"But Thompson didn’t see it that way. And his opinion is the one that counts. You need to be careful of the choices you make around here.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, but thoughts float up in your mind. You want to say it wasn’t your choice. Dan had asked, and you just followed. You try to picture yourself saying no to him. Or to Gordon. Or Clive. And can’t. But how could Annie understand that?\n\n \n\n She shrugs, brushing it off gently. \"Just something to think about. See you next week.\"\n\n \n \"Thompson saw you chatting with Dan again. He sent another note. This time to the headmaster.\"\n\n \n\n You feel your stomach twist.\n\n \n\n \"I know Dan has a certain appeal,\" Annie says gently, \"but remember, you’re being graded on this. I don’t want to see you suffer because some guy in the office wants to spend his Friday afternoons flirting with a young girl.\"\n\n \n\n You nod. Annie’s right. You know she is. But you can’t figure out how to stop. Being near Dan, responding to him - it just happens. Like there’s no option to say no.\n\n \n\n \"Try to remember why you’re here,\" Annie says. She grabs her bag, then offers a small wave. \"See you next week.\"\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n \n The day draws to a close.\n\n \n\n Annie walks you through how to shut down the systems - logging out of the appointments software, powering down the dusty monitor, unplugging the temperamental printer.

Dan had asked. And you had gone. Maybe you were curious. Maybe it felt safer to say yes. Maybe... you just didn’t want to say no.\n\n \n\n She shrugs, brushing it off gently. \"Just something to think about.

Said something about their performance. Thompson didn’t look too happy.\"\n\n \"Dan’s spiteful though. He didn’t say anything about you to Thompson, but I wouldn’t put it past him. Even after I ‘persuaded’ him not to.”\n\n \n\n Annie sighs. \"I’m not saying you were wrong to focus on your work. You weren’t. But maybe there’s a way to brush him off without giving him an excuse to lash out. Something to think about.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, grateful for the honesty. Annie smiles gently. \"Try to remember why you’re here,\" she says. \"See you next week.\"\n\n \n She smiles, then lowers her voice slightly. \n \n \"You did good. Thompson hasn't said anything new about your work... but Dan’s still nursing that ego. He made another offhand comment about your to Thompson earlier today.\"\n\n \"You did good. Thompson hasn't said anything new about your work... but Dan’s still nursing that ego. He hasn’t said anything to Thompson about you. But I wouldn’t put it past him.\"\n \n \n\n She shrugs. \"Just... keep it in mind. I know you’re doing the right thing. Be careful he doesn’t find new ways to punish you for it.\"\n\n \n\n Annie sighs. \"You’re not wrong to shut him down. Just... be smart about how you do it. Men like Dan don’t always play fair.\"\n\n \n\n She gathers her bag and slings it over her shoulder. \"Stay sharp. See you next week.\"\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "As you approach, Annie spots you and practically leaps up from her chair.\n\n \n\n \"Oh, thank god,\" she grins. \"I’ve been dying to swing by Evans’ - they’ve got this clearance sale on coats, and I swear I saw one with fur trim.\"\n\n \n\n She grabs her long coat from the stand, swishing it around her like a movie star. Even on the soft carpet, her heels click with purpose.\n\n \n\n \"Maybe I’ll grab a coffee, have a natter with Flo. I’ll be back in an hour… or so.\" She winks. \"Shouldn’t be too hard. Just some emails to write back to.\"\n\n \n\n Without waiting for a reply, she breezes out the door, leaving the faintest trace of expensive perfume in her wake.\n\n \n You glance over to the reception desk. Annie’s already gone. A large pastel post-it note is stuck to the monitor, the handwriting unmistakably hers - loopy, elegant, and overly familiar:\n\n \n\n *“Thanks ! See if you can make a dent in my inbox. See you soon x”\n*\n \n\n The screen is awake, the mail client open and buzzing with unread messages. You sigh and pull out the chair.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n \n \n You sit down at Annie’s desk and immediately understand why she was so happy to hand it off.\n\n \n\n Her computer hums like an old fridge, the monitor slightly discolored in one corner. The plastic is yellowed with age. And the logo? *“Curstons.”*\n\n \n \n You frown. You’ve never heard of it. Wait, weren’t they a typewriter manufacturer? That would explain a lot. The keyboard clacks like it’s trying to bite your fingers.\n\n \n\n Your own work computer is bad, sure. This one feels like a relic. You half-expect it to ask for a floppy disk. When you tap the mouse, the screen flickers and then loads Annie’s email inbox.\n\n \n\n It’s... overflowing.\n\n \n\n Dozens of messages sit flagged, unopened, or half-replied to. Most are from customers: people chasing invoices, asking about timelines, confused about missed appointments. You start to read through a few threads.\n\n \n\n **From:** Ron Denver\nChasing that water heater install again 😅 any updates, sweetheart?\n \n\n Annie's reply: *\"You know I love making you sweat, Ron 😉 I'll chase it up today. Promise x\"*\n\n \n\n **From:** Ian Palmer\nStill waiting for my receipt. Any chance of seeing that before next week?\n \n\n Annie's reply: *\"Only if you promise to give me more than five minutes for my next check-up, handsome. 😘\"*\n\n \n\n **From:** Marc Hudson\nBoiler's still knocking in the barn. Can someone look at it before it explodes?\n \n \n Annie's reply: *\"Sounds like it’s begging for attention, just like me. I’ll get someone on it x\"*\n\n \n\n You stare at the screen, deep in Annie’s inbox now. These customers are clearly expecting her. That tone. That playful, charming, slightly-too-familiar energy.\n\n \n\n If you start replying... do you try to match that? Or do you stick to your own style?\n\n \n You slide into Annie’s chair, already bracing yourself.\n\n \n\n The inbox is as messy as ever. Unread emails stacked like a game of digital Jenga. You’re starting to recognize names now. And patterns.\n\n \n\n Same customers. Same cheeky tone. Same disorganized chaos.\n\n \n\n One screen flicker from the ancient “Curstons” machine reminds you just how far back this desk is stuck in time.\n\n \n\n You crack your knuckles and get to work. The only question is how you're going to reply.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You stare at the blinking cursor, Annie’s half-finished draft open like a dare. The words in your head feel stiff, clunky. Not a single wink emoji that you can summon.\n\n \n\n First, you try typing something casual. Then delete it. Try again, softer. A little teasing. Still off. Eventually, you piece together a reply. Something about how you’re 'chasing the boys in the back room' and 'wouldn’t want to leave a handsome guy waiting too long.' You wince as you hit send.\n\n \n\n But a minute later - ding.\n\n \n\n The same customer replies. Quickly. His message is even flirty.\n\n \n\n Knew I could count on you, gorgeous 😉 I’ll put in a good word with your boss. Maybe he’ll give you that raise you deserve 😘\n \n\n You should probably get back to the earlier emails. But instead, you open his again. Reread it. Then reply. *\"Appreciate the good word, just don’t tell them how easy I am. To bribe.\" 😘*\n\n \n\n You hit send, sure he’ll be happy. And you’ve updated the schedule. It’s all sorted. The customer feels heard. Flattered.\n\n \n\n You lean back in the chair.\n\n \n\n It’s fine, right? You’re getting the job done. They’re happy. There’s no harm in what you’re doing...\n\n \n\n *Right?*\n\n \n It’s becoming second nature now.\n\n \n\n You slip into the seat, fingers already tapping before the screen finishes loading. Your inbox lights up with familiar names - customers who almost seem disappointed when someone else replies.\n\n \n\n You match Annie’s tone without thinking. A little teasing, a lot of charm. You even recognize the emojis they prefer.\n\n \n\n Messages pour back in. Grinning emojis, appreciative words, playful winks.\n\n \n\n Tell your boss he’s lucky to have such a charming secretary.\n \n\n If you ever want a drink, name the time 😉\n \n\n You hesitate... somehow, you can’t just say no.\n\n \n\n *\"Maybe. I’ll let you know.\"*\n\n \n\n You feel a faint pang. Like maybe you’re stepping into territory that isn’t quite yours. Annie’s inbox. Annie’s tone.\n\n \n\n But the customers are happy. And you’re good at this. You try not to dwell on how natural it feels now.\n\n \n\n It’s just part of your job.\n\n \n\n But this isn’t the job you really want to be doing. Is it?\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n \n You stare at Annie’s half-finished reply, the blinking cursor waiting for something light, playful… teasing.\n\n \n\n You delete it.\n\n \n\n Your fingers hover for a moment before typing something clearer. Straighter. More you.\n\n \n\n \"Apologies for the delay. I’ve followed up with our scheduling team, and your appointment has been re-confirmed for Thursday at 3pm. Let me know if you need to reschedule.\"\n\n \n\n You press send, then move on to the next one.\n\n \n\n *\"A copy of your invoice has been attached to this message. Please let us know if you require anything further.\"*\n\n \n\n *\"We’ve escalated the boiler issue and will aim to have a technician out by tomorrow morning. Thank you for your patience.\"*\n\n \n\n No emojis. No flirtation. Just... efficient.\n\n \n\n But the responses that come back?\n\n \n\n \"Wow. That’s the tone you’re using with a paying customer?”\n \n\n “This is the third time I’ve emailed. If you can’t be bothered to help, I’ll take it up with your boss.”\n \n\n “I’ve had it. Your customer service is abysmal.”\n \n\n Your stomach tightens.\n\n \n\n You know exactly where these complaints are going to land. And who Thompson will blame. But still. You can’t bring yourself to reply like Annie. You shouldn’t have to.\n\n \n\n You keep typing. Professional. Cold, maybe. But honest.\n\n \n\n *You need to hold onto something of yourself.*\n\n \n\n Even if it’s costing you.\n\n \n You slip into the chair, open the inbox, and brace yourself. The messages waiting for replies are already testy. Some downright furious. You keep your tone measured. Professional.\n\n \n\n *\"We’ve passed your request on to dispatch. Please allow 24 hours for a response.\"*\n\n \n\n *\"Our apologies for the confusion. I’ve forwarded your message to the correct department.\"*\n\n \n\n And then the replies hit:\n\n \n\n “Don’t give me copy-paste nonsense.”\n\n “I’ve already been waiting a week. This isn’t good enough.”\n\n “Tell your manager I’ll be leaving a review. And calling.”\n \n\n You sit back in the chair, jaw clenched. You could soften it. Just a little. Make it go down easier.\n\n \n\n But that’s not you. You didn’t sign up to charm your way out of other people’s mistakes. You’re trying to fix things. You’re being clear. You’re being right.\n\n \n\n But it’s not enough.\n\n \n\n And you know the blame won’t land where it belongs.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You’re juggling the phones, trying to triage a packed inbox that just won’t stop growing. Every time you answer one email, two more arrive. Most of them are minor. Mundane.\n\n \n\n “Can I push my appointment by fifteen minutes?”\n“Where do I park?”\n“Can you pop a reminder in my calendar?”\n \n\n You were once a programmer. Now you’re being asked to babysit inboxes and book diary slots like someone’s flustered personal assistant.\n\n \n\n Even the phone calls feel off. Customers want to chat. \"How's your day going?\" they ask, like you're just another sunny voice on the other end. They don’t care about the work. They just want the performance.\n\n \n\n You’re halfway through flagging a broken link in the supplier portal when you hear boots on the carpet.\n\n \n\n Gordon appears in the doorway. \"Phillips,\" he says, not waiting for a reply. He’s already striding toward you, a creased folder tucked under his arm.\n\n \n\n He stops in front of the desk and sets it down without ceremony.\n\n \n\n \"Expenses,\" he says. \"Thompson says they won’t go through unless they’re done today.\"\n\n \n\n He taps the folder once, then looks at you.\n\n \n\n \"I don’t do forms. Computers either. This stuff,\" he adds, gesturing at the monitor and keyboard. \"Not for me.\" He shrugs. \"Women’s work, really. But you can do it, yeah?\"\n\n \n\n There’s no edge in his tone. No apology, either. Just a task. Like handing you a wrench. You're here. You’ve got fingers. And he’s got receipts.\n\n \n You’ve barely sat down before the inbox pings. Three new queries. All trivial. Someone wants to push an appointment back by ten minutes. Another can’t find your street on Maps. Someone else wants to know if you can send a technician who’s \"good with cats.\"\n\n \n\n Then come the boots. The door to the office opens. Gordon. Again.\n\n \n\n He steps into view with that same folder tucked under one arm. All creased, bulging, edges frayed. The same as last time. Maybe literally the same.\n\n \n\n \"Phillips,\" he says, flat. Nods at the desk. \"Expenses. Thompson says they need doing today.\"\n\n \n\n He sets the folder down. Same gesture. Same tone. \"Pink job. You’ve got this. Right.\"\n\n \n\n It’s not a question. Not even a request. Just an assumption. This is what you do now.\n\n \n\n Another chore. Another tab open. Another piece of someone else’s job sliding across your desk.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n \n \n [Saucy Secretary] <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [Dutiful Doer] <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You’re behind the desk at lunch.

But the look he gives you? Like he owns you. Like something’s been settled. Won. His smirk is subtle now. Confident. Lazy. Like a man who doesn’t need to boast anymore.\n\n \n\n He doesn’t linger. Just throws a glance your way as he heads toward the door again. \"If anyone calls,\" he says, casual, \"tell them I’m in my personal office.\"\n\n \n\n You don’t need to ask. He means the pub. Then he’s gone.\n\n \n\n You return to focusing on your computer, stomach tight. You thought the tension might ease. It hasn’t. It's now just shifted.\n\n \n Dan walks in and stops just long enough to look at you. It’s not a leer. Not a smirk. Just something darker. Heavy. Calculating.\n\n \n\n He doesn’t speak. Not directly. Just grabs his jacket from the hook and mutters as he passes. \"If anyone calls, tell them I’m in my personal office.\"\n\n \n\n You know what that means. Everyone does. The pub.\n\n \n\n He walks out, the door swinging shut behind him with a little too much force. You stare at the screen for a second before turning back to work. It’s quiet now. But it doesn’t feel peaceful. It feels like the silence before something else.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You’re deep into emails, finally making a dent in the inbox backlog, when you hear a loud male laughter echoing across the reception area.\n\n \n\n Dan.\n\n \n\n He strolls toward the desk like he owns the place, grinning and mid-conversation with himself. \"And so I told him, ‘You want the job done right, you come to Dan.’ And guess what? He did.\"\n\n \n\n He leans against the counter, arms crossed, his eyes finally resting on you. \"See, this is why people trust me. You’ve got to be bold. Make noise. Put yourself out there.\"\n\n \n\n He’s not talking to you. He’s performing. Still, you nod politely, glancing back to your screen.\n\n \n\n \"Anyway,\" Dan continues, waving a hand like he’s wrapping up a TED Talk. \"Thinking of getting something from Fresh Pot. Bacon roll, maybe a wrap. You mind grabbing it for me?\" He flashes a smile. “Wouldn’t want to step away while I’ve got deals on the go, you know?”\n\n \n It’s become part of the routine now - emails, phones, blinking lights - and Dan, swaggering over at lunch just as things start to calm down.\n\n \n\n He leans on the desk, already mid-boast. \"So this guy, right, complete amateur, tries to undercut me on a supply quote. I tell him, ‘You’re not just buying parts. You’re buying Dan.’”\n\n \n\n He chuckles at his own genius, then grins at you like you're lucky to be in his presence.\n\n \n\n \"Thinking about lunch. Fresh Pot’s calling me. Bacon roll, bit of sauce, maybe crisps. You mind grabbing it?\"\n\n \n\n He gives you a wink. “Be a sweetheart.

You paint your customer service smile on your face before looking up to see Emily standing in the entrance, looking back at you.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n Emily's shock drains quickly, but not fully. She steps into reception, eying you sheepishly. \"Hey,\" she says quietly.\n\n \n\n The internship...\n\n \n\n Emotions flutter inside you. Shame. Embarrassment. An odd sensation where your mind is trying to make sense of what feels like a dream. But you push it all down. \"Hey,\" you reply.\n\n \n\n \"I guess you'll be the one showing me the ropes?\" Emily asks. \"My , teaching me how to be a secretary.\"\n\n \n\n \"Don't make this weird,\" you say quietly. Your voice trembling. She smiles with sadness, but nods. \"Okay. Where do we start?\"\n\n \n Emily's eyes widen and a strange smile creeps up on her face. You can see she's holding back her laughter. Your cheeks begin to burn. \"Don't,\" you warn her. But it just encourages her smile to grow.\n\n \n\n \"I didn't say anything,\" she mock protests. \"I must say, knowing it is one thing. Seeing the great programmer behind a reception desk, that's another.\"\n\n \n\n \"That's mean,\" you tell her quietly.\n\n \n\n \"Oh relax,\" your sister replies. \"This could be fun. Just so long as you don't cramp my style. I don't need my daggy getting in the way of showing how well I can charm and banter.\"\n\n \n\n She walks assuredly around the counter and leans up against the desk, giving you a smirk. “So boss. Where do you want me?”\n\n \n \n \n Emily's mouth drops open. She stares at you, disbelief on her face. \"? What are you doing there?\n\n \n\n You try to make sense of your sister standing in front of you. Then realisation hits. The internship...\n\n \n\n Emotions flutter inside you. Shame. Embarrassment. An odd sensation where your mind is trying to make sense of what feels like a dream. But you push it all down. \"Hey,\" you reply. \"I'm on reception now.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes narrow. \"What, are you covering for Annie whilst she's popped out?\" When you don't reply, her eyes only grow narrower. \"This isn't your job. Is it?\"\n\n \n\n You sigh. \"I got... demoted. I was going to tell you. I just didn't have time\"\n\n \n\n \"Demoted?\" she repeats back. \"But why, ? What's going on?\"\n\n \n\n The switchboard phone rings, making you jump. You glance over at it, then to Emily. \"Let's talk about this at home. For now though, I'll be the one showing you the ropes this afternoon. Just... let's try to get through this, okay?\"\n\n \n\n She smiles with sadness, but nods. \"Okay. Where do we start?\"\n\n \n Emily's mouth drops open. She stares at you for a long moment, before a strange smile creeps up on her face. You can see she's holding back her laughter.

I hope.\"\n\n \n\n \"You hope?\" she snarks, her grin growing wider. \"Are you trying to tell me that the great maths whiz is now working as a secretary?\" She can't help but let out a giggle. \"I can see why you didn't tell me.\"\n\n \n\n \"That's mean,\" you tell her quietly. \"We can talk at home about it.\"\n\n \n\n \"Sure,\" your sister replies, grinning. \"Can't wait to hear all the details.\" Sudden realisation crosses her face. \"So you're going to teach me how to be a receptionist?\"\n\n \n\n \"I guess,\" you say, without conviction.\n\n \n\n At this, she laughs. \"Well, today just got real interesting. But maybe this could be fun. Just don't cramp my style. I don't need my daggy getting in the way of showing how well I can charm and banter.\"\n\n \n\n She walks assuredly around the counter and leans up against the desk, giving you a smirk. “So boss. Where do you want me?”\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Emily smiles meekly at you, still not used to seeing you behind the counter.

What are we doing today?\" she asks.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n Emily grins at the sight of you, but strolls in with confidence and purpose. She tosses her bag behind the counter and leans casually against the computer. \"Hey . Another day of manning phones and talking to beefy tradesmen. That reminds me, I don't suppose Dan is around, is he?\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes wander. You move the mouse, bringing the monitor back to life, trying to make a point. \"Oh,\" she exclaims. \"Right. Work.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You are working the reception inbox, responding to customer’s queries, when a message pops up on your screen.\n\n \n\n Need you in my office. Now.\n \n\n You stop what you're doing and stand up, knowing full well not to risk Thompson’s wrath. You walk through into the office - where you used to work - and notice Annie sitting at a new desk, pushed up against Thompson’s door. \n\n \n\n “You should go in,” she says, her trademark enthusiasm absent. \n\n \n\n Taking a step up, you knock on the door. In an instant you hear Thompson’s voice bellow. “Enter!”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n The afternoon passes easily, as you answer phones and check calendars for availability. The familiar ping draws your attention to the bulky monitor.\n\n \n\n Need you in my office. Again.\n \n\n With only a slight hesitation, you stand and walk through the office, passing by Annie as you knock. “Come,” you hear Thompson yell.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n\n The day draws to a close.\n\n \n\n You shut down the computer, logging out of systems and wiping down the dusty monitor. You glance over to the office and see light seeping out from underneath the door. Someone is still working.\n\n \n\n Which is just as well, as Thompson hasn't given you a key to lock up. In spite of taking over Annie's position, he hasn't afforded you the one perk of her job - complete access to the office with your own set of keys.\n\n \n\n Flicking off the desk lamp, you gather your belongings and exit, grateful for the end of another working day.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

    "text": "You give Gordon a small, playful smile. \"Maybe I’ll have a word with Mr. Thompson,\" you say, voice light. \"Tell him you’re flat out and could use a hand.\"\n\n \n\n Gordon doesn’t blink. Doesn’t smile. \"Just get it done,\" he mutters, already turning back toward the shop floor.\n\n \n\n So much for charm.\n\n \n\n You glance down at the paper stack of receipts he’s left you. Then at the mounting wave of emails flooding the inbox. You need to act fast. Opening a new message, you start typing.\n\n \n\n Hi Mr. Thompson. Gordon’s totally snowed under today. He asked me to help with his expenses, and of course I didn’t want to let the company down 😉 Just wondering if I could take a little time to get them sorted properly. Promise I’ll be very grateful… x\n \n\n You hover for a moment. Then hit send. The reply comes back faster than expected.\n\n \n\n End of the week’s fine. If you need to stay late to catch up… I’ll be working late too. We can keep each other company.\n \n\n You stare at the screen. The reply. Something in your stomach turns, but you push it down.\n\n \n\n The receipts will get done. The emails will get answered. You got through a tricky situation without letting anything fall apart. Even if you had to pander to the boss.\n\n \n\n You try not to think about it too much.\n\n \n You already know Gordon won’t react to flirting. So you switch it up. \"Alright,\" you say, keeping your tone breezy. \"I’ll have a word with Thompson. Buy you a bit of time.\"\n\n \n\n Gordon just grunts. Not impressed. But not arguing either. “Thanks,” he mutters, walking off.\n\n \n\n You take the folder and settle back at the desk, already typing up a message.\n\n \n\n Hi Mr. Thompson. Just letting you know Gordon’s still up to his neck today. He’s asked me to handle his expenses, but I didn’t want to slow anything down. If we could have a bit of leeway to get them in, I’d really appreciate it 💋\n \n\n Thompson’s reply lands a minute later.\n\n \n\n That’s fine. Maybe you should come into my office later. We can discuss how to make things easier for Gordon. Just the two of us.\n \n\n You wince. It’s a win, technically. The work’s bought some time. The inbox hasn’t exploded. But Thompson’s “encouragement” feels like it comes at a price.\n\n \n\n And you’re not sure how many more wins like this you can stomach.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You barely hesitate. It just comes out: \"Yeah, of course.\"\n\n \n\n Gordon gives a short nod. \"Thanks.\" He’s already walking back toward the shop floor.\n\n \n\n You’re left with the folder… and a growing weight in your chest. The rest of the morning is spent inputting receipts into the clunky spreadsheet.\n\n \n\n A bacon sandwich and tea from Fresh Pot - overtime breakfast.\n\n \n\n Three separate parking stubs from outside the Town Hall.\n\n \n\n A hand-written receipt from Pete’s pharmacy for \"stationery and bits.\"\n\n \n\n You remember - not long ago - you were writing code to help automate the field schedules. You were literally solving how Gordon could avoid needing overtime. Now you’re logging his tea breaks into a finance form.\n\n \n\n When you finally close the spreadsheet, the red light on the phones is blinking. At least five missed calls. You flick to the inbox. Twelve new emails. All angry at the lack of a response. You know Thompson’s going to be furious.\n\n \n\n But Gordon asked. And you said yes. Before you even thought about it.\n\n \n\n *Why would you?*\n\n \n \"Yeah,\" you say. \"I’ve got it.\" You’re already pulling up the spreadsheet. Already moving aside the call log. Already shifting tabs.\n\n \n\n As you begin to process the receipts, you reflect back on what you do - or did - for a living. It feels like another life. One where you were coding backend schedules and catching bugs Gordon didn’t understand. \n\n \n\n *And now?*\n\n \n\n Now you log his receipts. Cross-check parking times. Input the mileage for a run to a supplier. Attach a photo of a breakfast wrap from Fresh Pot. Yet it just seems normal.\n\n \n\n You barely notice how long it takes. But when you look back at the monitor, the phones are flashing again. The inbox is worse. \n\n \n\n You sigh, rub your temple, and keep working. Thompson won’t be happy, but Gordon asked. And this is what you do now.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You pause for just a second. Then say, \"Sure. I’ll do it.\"\n\n \n\n Gordon nods and moves off without a second glance. You’re left holding the folder. It's not heavy, but it feels... beneath you.\n\n \n\n You settle into your seat, open the spreadsheet, and start sorting through the receipts. Fuel. Lunch. A bacon sandwich and tea from Fresh Pot. A handwritten slip from Pete’s for \"stationery.\"\n\n \n\n You glance over at the inbox. It’s piling up again. Phones are blinking too. You should be dealing with them. Instead, you’re inputting Gordon’s overtime snacks. You sigh. You’re not even sure why you said yes. He didn’t push. You weren’t compelled. You just… did.\n\n \n\n And as you keep typing, you find yourself picturing Gordon hunched over this spreadsheet. Carefully logging the correct VAT code. Matching the mileage. You can’t even imagine it.\n\n \n\n Something about you doing it feels... right. Expected. Gordon’s words echo faintly in your mind. \"Women’s work.\"\n\n \n\n You scoff to yourself. That’s Charlton talking. That bias. Maybe you’re thinking that way because of the town. Maybe because the amulet. Maybe both.\n\n \n\n But you still don’t stop. You process every last receipt. And try to ignore the blinking red lights on the phone.\n\n \n You take the folder automatically. \"Yeah, I’ll get to it.\"\n\n \n\n There’s no real thought behind the response anymore. No guilt, either. As Gordon walks off, you open the spreadsheet. Start sorting. Fuel. Snacks. Another scribbled receipt from Pete’s pharmacy. It doesn’t feel like a favour now. Not even a disruption. It’s just... routine.\n\n \n\n You glance at the inbox. Eighteen new emails. The red light on the phone is blinking again. It pulses like a heartbeat. You ignore it and look back to Gordon’s receipts. You’re getting used to this. \n\n \n\n You shouldn’t be. You remember a time - back in the city - when that phrase Gordon used would’ve made you snap. \"Pink jobs for the girls. Blue jobs for the men.\"\n\n \n\n It pops into your head now like something natural. Like breathing. You try to push it down. Remind yourself that Charlton is weird. That this isn’t who you are.\n\n \n\n But still... as your fingers fly across the keys, the repetition becomes soothing. The inbox, the blinking lights. They feel... loud. Like dealing with that would be too much for you.\n\n \n\n But this? Gordon’s admin? This you can handle.\n\n \n\n And for a moment, you feel almost... grateful.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You glance at the growing inbox. The flashing phones. Then you look up at Gordon. \"Sorry. But I’ve got scheduling to get on with. You wouldn’t want to turn up at the wrong address, would you?\"\n\n \n\n Gordon exhales through his nose. Frustrated, but not unreasonable. \"Guess I’ll have to find time myself then.\"\n\n \n\n He picks up the folder and walks off, muttering something under his breath that you don’t catch. You turn back to your screen and get to work. Calls. Confirmations. Re-bookings. More emails than you can count, and all of them petty.\n\n \n\n It’s trivial work. But there’s a lot of it.\n\n \n\n Your thoughts flick back to what Gordon said earlier. “Women’s work.” You scoff. The idea’s ancient. Archaic. Stupid. But as you flick between call logs and shared calendars, fingers flying over keys, you feel it. That little itch.\n\n \n\n This isn’t what you were built for. That’s right. This isn’t you. Is it?\n\n \n\n You sigh. You’re just not sure anymore.\n\n \n \"I can’t, Gordon,\" you say, without looking up. \"Sorry! I’ve got ten jobs to confirm and a call waiting already.\"\n\n \n\n He huffs. Shifts the folder under his arm. \"Alright,\" he mutters. \"Can’t blame a guy for trying.\"\n\n \n\n He turns and walks off, and you spin back to the blinking red lights, the inbox, the post-its. You keep typing. Keep answering. Keep smiling. It’s just work. It’s all work.\n\n \n\n But your thoughts drift. To how the guys treat you now. Like you’re support staff. Backup. An extra pair of hands. Charlton treats its receptionists like second-tier employees.\n\n \n\n And the worst part?\n\n \n\n As you answer the next call with a bright, cheerful voice... you wonder how long it’ll be until you’re okay with that.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You don’t even think before the words leave your mouth. \"Yeah. I’ll get it.\"\n\n \n\n Dan grins. “Knew I could count on you, darl. Bacon roll. Bit of sauce. And get yourself something sweet while you’re at it. My treat.”\n\n \n\n You ignore the comment and step out of the reception area. By the time you get to Fresh Pot, it’s packed. The lunch rush in full swing. Flo is darting behind the counter, trying to smile, take orders, and not lose her mind. You stand in the queue, and for a few minutes just wait.\n\n \n\n Thoughts turn to Dan. About the fact he could’ve gone himself. You know he’s not busy. He’s either heading down to the pub or on the phone at his desk, talking to his country club friends on speaker about his latest romantic \"conquest.\" He could’ve got his own lunch. But he asked and you said yes. Not because you wanted to.\n\n \n\n Because you needed to.\n\n \n\n *That’s what good employees do.*\n\n \n\n It takes fifteen minutes to get served. You return to the office with the warm paper bag in hand. Dan is at his desk, feet up, phone wedged under his chin. “That power shot really aced him,” you hear him mutter. “You should have seen his wife giving the eye.”\n\n \n\n As he sees you, he winks. “Oh, brilliant. Knew you were the reliable type.”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t stop his conversation. Just waves vaguely in your direction and keeps talking. You walk back to reception in silence. Feeling underappreciated. Invisible. But deep down, you know you couldn’t have said no.\n\n \n\n Sitting back at your desk, it’s not half an hour until a message comes through from Mr. Thompson.\n\n \n\n \n Just spoke to Dan. Mentioned you got him lunch so he could close out a deal. Good work. Helping the men do the actual work is a great way for women to support. Maybe this is the role you were born for, Phillips!\n \n Just spoke to Dan. Mentioned you got him lunch so he could close out a deal. Good work. Usually say that helping the men do the actual work was a woman’s job, but you’re doing it nicely. Maybe you should have been born a girl, Phillips!\n \n \n\n For some reason, you can’t help but dwell on it for the rest of lunch.\n\n \n \"Sure,\" you say, already reaching for your coat. Dan barely reacts. “Nice one,” he says, already half-turned back toward his desk. “You’re a star.”\n\n \n\n Fresh Pot is busy. Again. It always is. Flo catches your eye and gives you a quick, tired smile before turning back to the till. You join the queue. Wait. Think. Tell yourself you’ll push back next time. That Dan can fetch his own bacon roll and crisps like every other adult.\n\n \n\n But when the moment comes - when he grins and asks - you know you’ll just say yes. Every time.\n\n \n\n When you return, Dan’s got his feet up again. Phone in one hand, already mid-call. “Ah, the hero returns,” he says, barely looking at you. “Cheers, sweetheart.”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t even take the bag from your hand. Just gestures to the desk, still talking. You walk back to reception and sit down. The phones are blinking again. The inbox is filling. This is just your life now. To do what’s asked of you.\n\n \n\n Your computer chimes and you see another message from Thompson.\n\n \n\n \n Getting the men what they need. Keep it up. Might bag yourself a husband with an attitude like that, Phillips!\n \n Getting the men what they need. Keep it up. Might want to pick out a girl’s name soon, Phillips!\n \n \n \n\n You sigh, trying to ignore the comment for the rest of lunch.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You pause. You could say no. But instead, you nod. \"Sure. I’ll get it.\"\n\n \n\n Dan grins. “Knew you’d come through. Bacon roll, bit of sauce. And maybe something sweet. You pick.”\n\n \n\n You slip on your coat and head out. When you get to Fresh Pot, it’s packed with the lunch rush. Flo’s barely keeping up, her hair swinging as she rushes between counters.\n\n \n\n You wait in line. Quiet. Still. There’s a strange comfort in it. You think about what just happened. About how you didn’t have to do this. But you did. Not because you were told. Because… it felt expected. Dan’s not busy. You know that. He’ll be on the phone, bragging about the country club or chatting up whoever’s at the Charlton Hotel in the restaurant. But he asked. And in Charlton, when a man like him asks, it’s easier to say yes.\n\n \n\n When you return, Dan is exactly where you pictured him. Feet up, phone at his ear. “Cheers,” he says, glancing at the bag. “You’re a star.”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t break conversation. Doesn’t say thank you.\n\n \n\n You return to your desk and sit down. Phones blinking. Inbox refilling. Another task waiting. You don’t feel angry. Just… smaller.\n\n \n\n It’s not half an hour until a message comes through from Mr. Thompson.\n\n \n\n \n Just spoke to Dan. Mentioned you got him lunch so he could close out a deal. Good work. Helping the men do the actual work is a great way for women to support. Maybe this is the role you were born for, Phillips!\n \n Just spoke to Dan. Mentioned you got him lunch so he could close out a deal. Good work. Usually say that helping the men do the actual work was a woman’s job, but you’re doing it nicely. Maybe you should have been born a girl, Phillips!\n \n \n\n For some reason, you can’t help but dwell on it.\n\n \n Dan doesn’t need to ask twice anymore. You grab your coat. Nod. “I’ll go.”\n\n \n\n He smiles like it’s only natural. “Get something sweet, yeah? I trust your taste.”\n\n \n\n You step into the high street, shoulders hunched. The queue at Fresh Pot almost out the door, and you already know how this will go. Wait. Deliver. Return. Smile. Dan never says thank you. He just takes what you bring and throws a grin your way like a tip.\n\n \n \n And the worst part? It doesn’t bother you like it used to.\n\n \n\n You walk back into the office, coat damp, fingers tight around the paper bag. He waves you toward his desk, already talking on the phone. You drop it off and return to yours. Another hour, another dozen emails. Then a message from Thompson:\n\n \n\n \n Getting the men what they need. Keep it up. Might bag yourself a husband with an attitude like that, Phillips!\n \n Getting the men what they need. Keep it up. Might want to pick out a girl’s name soon, Phillips!\n \n \n\n You sigh and return to your work.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You glance at the inbox. The phones. You’re actually getting ahead for once. So you shake your head. \"Sorry, Dan. I’ve got a lot to get through.\"\n\n \n\n Dan doesn’t frown. Doesn’t yell. He just smiles. Slowly. \"See, Phillips,\" he says, leaning on the desk like he’s your guidance counsellor, \"that’s not how things work in Charlton. This place isn’t about ticking boxes or playing Tetris with meetings. It’s about who you know. Who you help. Who you're friends with.\" He leans in slightly. \"And you and me? You’re going about the wrong way of becoming my friend.\"\n\n \n\n He taps the counter once, gives you a little wink, and strolls off.\n\n \n\n You watch him go. When he doesn’t return, you assume he’s gone to the pub instead. You keep working. You’re ahead on call logs. The inbox is under control. Appointments confirmed, meetings managed. Still, half an hour later, a message from Thompson drops into your inbox.\n\n \n\n Heard you’ve been behind on calendar bookings. Not good enough. Be a team player, Phillips. You don’t want to make enemies here.\n \n \n You stare at the screen. Everything’s on schedule. But you already know: Dan had a word.\n\n \n You turn him down again. Polite. Calm. \"I’ve got work to finish.\"\n\n \n\n Dan exhales like you’ve disappointed him. \"You’re still not getting it,\" he says. \"Charlton’s not like where you came from.\" He adjusts his cufflinks. \"Survival here? It’s not about getting the job done. It’s about having people who speak up for you.\"\n\n \n\n Then his voice drops just a little. \"And if I’m not one of them - well, people misunderstand things. They hear something wrong. They start to talk. Coffee runs and office smiles won’t fix that.\"\n\n \n\n He walks out, same as always. You slump in your chair. Dan continues to be Dan. And almost expecting it, half an hour later a message from Thompson appears.\n\n \n\n Just had feedback about your tone on the phone. Curt. Unhelpful. You’re the face of this company, Phillips. Start acting like it. Think about how you're reflecting us when you talk to people.\n \n\n You clench your jaw. You know it’s Dan. And you wonder, how many more of these quiet words of his can you take?\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You give him a teasing smile. \"I’d love to, really, but I’ve just done my hair… and you’ve seen the drizzle out there. You wouldn’t want me coming back looking like a drowned rat, would you?\"\n\n \n\n Dan raises an eyebrow, then grins slowly. \"Depends on the blouse,\" he says. \"Bet there’s a few contests you’d win if it got see-through.\"\n\n \n\n You should be disgusted. But something in it flickers deep inside you. Not outrage. Something closer to… amusement. You lean on the desk, offering a coy smile. \"Know anywhere that runs contests like that?\"\n\n \n\n Dan chuckles. \"There’s a bar out of town. They do event nights. I could take you. You’d clean up.\"\n\n \n\n \"That would be nice,\" you reply, voice soft.\n\n \n\n He straightens, adjusting his jacket. \"I’ll leave you to it then. Can’t have Flo missing out on my lunchtime charm. But you just say the night, sweetheart - I’ll show you a very good time.\"\n\n \n\n He walks off, smug. You turn back to your screen. You may have pushed him off today, but now you’re wondering how far you could push him. \n\n \n\n And disturbingly… you smile.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You rest your chin on your hand and give him an apologetic look. \"Can’t today. I’ve got meetings lined up... unless you want me to cancel everything just for you.\"\n\n \n\n Dan smirks. \"I’d be fine with that if I get you to myself instead.\"\n\n \n\n You laugh, flirtatious. \"Tempting. But not today. Maybe after work. And I charge overtime.\"\n\n \n\n That lands. Too well. \"Don’t worry,\" Dan says. \"I’ve got the hotel on speed dial. Quiet little corner room. Has its… advantages. Especially if the night goes where I think it might.\"\n\n \n\n You deflect again. “I might have a scheduling conflict this evening. You know how bad this booking system is.”\n\n \n\n He narrows his eyes, mock-offended. But there’s steel behind the smile. \"Keep teasing, sweetheart. I’ll expect some personal attention soon.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n You try to play coy again. \"Not today. Too much to do. But I could make you some toast later on. I bet I can butter you up, nicely.\"\n\n \n\n Dan lets a dark grin spread across his face. He steps in closer. Drops his voice. \"Maybe we skip lunch. I’ve got something I need to show you.\"\n\n \n\n You blink. \"What, now?\"\n\n \n\n He leans in, voice low and insistent. \"Bathroom. It’s quiet at lunchtimes. We won’t be interrupted. Five minutes. I’ll keep it quick. You’ll enjoy it. See how you do at spreading.\"\n\n \n\n You try to laugh it off, make another joke. But he cuts you off.\n\n \n\n \"You. Me. Bathroom. Now.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n Your pulse is still pounding when you nod. You don’t know why you do it. You’re not scared. Not exactly. Not even convinced it’ll help. But you do it anyway. \n\n \n\n Dan’s grin says everything. “Attagirl,” he mutters, already stepping towards the exit. “Come on.”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t wait for a response. Just heads down the corridor, casual as anything. You follow. You don’t stop to think. Don’t ask yourself where this leads. You already know. \n\n \n\n Dan opens the bathroom door, gestures you in.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You try to laugh it off, even as your pulse starts to quicken. \"Not today,\" you say, voice soft, coaxing. \"Some other time, maybe. I’ve got a full plate… and I wouldn’t want to leave all the boys waiting, would I?\"\n\n \n\n You even smile. Just enough to soften it. But it doesn’t land. Dan’s grin doesn’t shift. Doesn’t falter. It drops. What’s left behind isn’t amused. Or flattered. It’s something mean. Dangerous.\n\n \n\n He steps in, too close. His voice lowers, but the words are sharp, now cutting. \"You think this is a game?\"\n\n \n\n You open your mouth to speak. Say something, anything. But he keeps going. \"I’ve been patient with you. Polite. Fun. But now? Now I see what you are.”\n\n \n\n He leans in, his breath hot and sour. \"Don’t worry, sweetheart. I’ll have a word with Thompson. About his new secretary. I’ll tell him how she strings along the guys who work hard. Makes promises. Flirts. Smiles. Leads ‘em on. But never follows through.\"\n\n \n\n He straightens, eyes scanning your face. \"See how long you last.\"\n\n \n\n He walks off, slow and deliberate. You stay frozen at the desk. Cold all over. You don’t have to wait long for his revenge. Thirty minutes later, your computer chimes. A message from Thompson.\n\n \n\n Dan’s just been in touch. Says he’s seen you slipping out during work hours. That you were spotted in the Salon. Not acceptable. Buck your ideas up. Or I’ll find someone who will.\n \n\n You stare at the screen, heart in your throat. You said no. Politely. Firmly. And this is what it gets you. In Charlton, you realise, you push the wrong person too far, and they push back harder. They expect certain things. And not following through has consequences.\n\n \n\n On you.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n **Thompson's Handyman Repairs - Thompson's Office**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Office_Thompson.png]\n\n \n\n \n \n You enter the office, the dark oak wood lit by office lamps and the blinds pulled down. Thompson sits behind his desk, flicking through papers. “Phillips,” he says. “Take a seat.”\n\n \n\n You step forward towards his desk and spot an object in front of the seat immediately. Sitting on the desk beside a pile of thick envelopes is a black, boxy typewriter - matte casing, faint gold engraving curling around the edges, and yellowed keys. Keys that fizzle with magic. \n\n \n\n Thompson doesn’t notice your hesitation. He’s already halfway through explaining what he needs. “Correspondence for the McTafey account. I’ll dictate, you type. You can manage that, can’t you?”\n\n \n\n You step forward slowly. The keys glint with yellow energy. Almost waiting for your touch.\n\n \n You enter, seeing the same typewriter sitting exactly where it did last time - solid, humming faintly, slightly too warm to the touch. Magic emanating from its keys.\n\n \n\n Thompson gestures to the typewriter. “Same deal. Listen and type.”\n\n \n\n You stare at the machine. Its blank paper already loaded. The aura’s still there.\n\n \n \n \n Actions\n\n \n \n [Saucy Secretary] <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [Dutiful Doer] <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You offer him a playful smile, voice honeyed. “Might break a nail, typing boss. And I know how much you care about my needs.”\n\n \n\n Thompson’s grin spreads, wide and leering. “Glad to see you understand how I look out for my people,” he says. “But I really need these letters typed up.”\n\n \n\n Flirting your eyelashes, you mock pout. “Oh, come on. There must be something you’d rather do with me this afternoon?”\n\n \n\n The old man sighs, his eyes flicking across your body. “I can think of a few things,” he mutters. “But not in the office. Thin walls.”\n\n \n\n He leans back in his chair, looking you up and down. “But I’ve got a good relationship with the manager at the Charlton Hotel. Business lunch, say, next week? Private room. Solid brickwork.”\n\n \n\n You hear yourself giggle, a small one, like a young girl in love for the first time. “Sounds like we won’t be disturbed.”\n\n \n\n “I mean, no one can hear the screams from outside,” he adds, with a chuckle. “That is, if you haven’t already got something in your mouth.”\n\n \n\n You freeze, his grotesque stares appraising you like a plaything for his entertainment. \n\n \n\n Thompson then leans forward, gesture crisp toward the typewriter. “But work first. Can you type? Or not?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n You try again. Light smile. Flirty tone. Soft voice. “Bit worried about my nails, still…”\n\n \n\n But Thompson cuts you off sharply. “Drop the act.” He doesn’t shout. But his voice is all blade. “You wanted things to be professional, didn’t you? To not be - what was your word - inappropriate? Fine. So don’t think you can flirt your way out of what I pay you to do. How’s that for appropriateness?”\n\n \n\n He leans back in his seat, adjusting the cuffs on his shirt. “And if you try that again, I’ve got the school on speed dial. Always a few girls who didn’t finish sixth form. Ones who’d do anything --” His eyes glint. “-- and I mean anything – for a respectable job.”\n\n \n\n He points at the typewriter. Cold. Final. “Now. Type. And no excuses.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n You lean on the edge of his desk, eyes soft, voice sweet. “I would, but… I wouldn’t want to break a nail. You wouldn’t want me to ruin my best assets, would you? After all, beauty is my greatest asset.”\n\n \n\n Thompson raises an eyebrow, unimpressed. But he doesn’t shut you down immediately. “Plenty of secretaries manage to type just fine. Even with their little pedicures.”\n\n \n\n You shrug, smile still in place. “I’m still learning,” you say, playing with the edge of your sleeve. “I’d just prefer to… practice a little first. Get more confident. Before I risk looking anything less than perfect.”\n\n \n\n You let the final words hang in the air. Seeing skepticism on his face, you realise you need to go one step further. Softer, you add: “Perfect for you.”\n\n \n\n Thompson gives a short laugh through his nose. “Fine. Today’s a pass. But typing’s not optional, sweetheart. You want to keep this job, you make sure you’re better prepared next time.”\n\n \n\n You nod, almost relieved. But some part of you… enjoyed that. Too much.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You flash a smile. “Still worried about my nails. It’s silly, but I’d hate to chip one.”\n\n \n\n Thompson rolls his eyes. “You’ve had enough time. If you can’t do the basics, you’re no use to me.”\n\n \n\n You lean in a little closer. “I am useful,” you murmur. “Just not always in the ways people expect. I’m more of a… morale booster. Don’t you think?”\n\n \n\n The words come out of your mouth without forming in your brain. Part of you feels aghast at what you said. What you implied. But you instantly feel the rush of endorphins within your body. It feels good.\n\n \n\n His expression shifts. Not quite approval, but curiosity. Appraisal. “I’m giving you one last pass,” he says. “You’ve got one more chance to learn. After that, there’ll be consequences.”\n\n \n\n You lower your lashes, savouring the sensation of your body responding. “Oh, I’ll look into it.” Then, lightly: “We wouldn’t want to have to punish me, would we?”\n\n \n\n Thompson grins. But doesn’t answer.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You try again. Smile bright. Voice light. Another flirty deflection on your lips. “I just don’t think I’m up for this, today. Isn’t there something else I can be doing for you?”\n\n \n\n He stands from behind his desk as he looks at you. Appraising you. His frustration from your ongoing resistance in conflict with his curiosity.\n\n \n\n “You’re right. If you won’t type, I’ll have to find another use for you in the afternoons.” He gestures toward the desk. “Bend over.”\n\n \n\n Your breath catches. “Excuse me?”\n\n \n\n He steps around the desk. “You heard me. Over the desk. Now.”\n\n \n\n You feel the weight of the magic inside you, the compulsion pressing faintly at the edge of your thoughts. But this time, it’s not the effects of magic that makes you hesitate.\n\n \n\n It’s simple fear.\n\n \n\n Thompson’s voice drops, low and commanding. “A good secretary follows orders.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n Accept his demand - *If you know one thing about Thompson, you know that he won't respond kindly to your micro-penis. You don't want to take the chance.*\n\n \n <>\n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n You take a seat and place your fingers on the typewriter. The keys are warm, almost pulsing. And as Thompson starts speaking, your hands begin moving before your mind fully catches up.\n\n \n\n “McTafey,” Thompson begins, “Thank you for your ongoing commitment. In regards to your challenges with regulations for your sun room, I suggest we convene at the Mayor’s office to discuss a way forward. Red tape shouldn’t stop any of us making the most of our hard earned savings to improve our homes.”\n\n \n\n “Feel free to call and arrange a time that’s suitable for you. My new secretary can work out the details with Town Hall. I trust you’ll find them up to standard. Be specific with your requests, though - details confuse them sometimes, but they are trying their best.”\n\n \n\n You flinch. The phrasing lands wrong. But your fingers don’t stop. As you type, you hear the words echo in your mind. Details confuse them sometimes, but they are trying their best. Arranging an appointment doesn’t seem beyond you. But something seems suddenly complex about the task. But you’ll at least try to do it, despite the difficulty.\n\n \n\n Some part of you knows it’s the magic. The embers of magic leap up from the keys, sparking against your fingertips. But even as you try to pause or question, your fingers don’t respond. The words appear on the paper anyway. Smooth. Compliant. Mechanical.\n\n \n\n Another line comes: “I’ve instructed them to take notes, though I doubt they’ll grasp the full picture.”\n\n \n\n Your cheeks flush. Not just embarrassment. Confusion. Because it doesn’t feel false. For a moment, you really don’t know if you understand it all. Maybe you're missing something. Maybe there’s more to booking appointments than you thought. You try to shake it. But the typewriter hums beneath your skin.\n\n \n\n Time passes and Thompson continues to dictate. Letters for McTafeys, for the most part responses to problems they are having with their extension. But you wince whenever Thompson injects a phrase that references you. Demeaning. Condescending. Belittling your abilities. When it’s done, he dismisses you. You stand and exit the office, aware of the impact of the typewriters magic, even as you find the idea of arranging appointments with the town hall overwhelming.\n\n \n You sit. Keys ready. Fingers waiting. Thompson begins to speak. “Client requires discretion. Have them call my secretary directly. They get lost in the details, but enthusiastic. After all, a good secretary follows orders.”\n\n \n\n You wince. But you don’t stop typing. Each word slides through your fingers, and the magic tingles deeper now, settling in like an old perfume. It clouds your thoughts, just a little. Makes you question yourself. There’s a line: “With encouragement, even the simplest secretary can become adequate.”\n\n \n\n And you believe it. Maybe that’s what you are. Simple. In need of guidance.\n\n \n\n You know this is magic. You know it’s the machine. Still, you want Thompson to think you’re doing well. You want him to praise you. You want to be good at this, even if part of you knows it’s a spell whispering that need.\n\n \n\n When he finally finishes, you blink down at the finished letter. Typed perfectly.\n\n \n\n But your thoughts feel fuzzier than when you started.\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You pause for a second too long. You could say no. Could tell Thompson you’re not comfortable using that thing. But instead, you nod. “Alright. I’ll do it.”\n\n \n\n You sit. Place your hands on the keys. They’re warm. Buzzing faintly. Like they’ve been waiting for you. Thompson begins. “McTafey’s sunroom issue. Let’s start there.”\n\n \n\n His voice is calm. Businesslike. But it’s the phrasing that catches you. “Feel free to call and book an appointment. My secretary’s still getting the hang of things, but they are eager to help. Just be clear. Complicated details tend to go over their head.”\n\n \n\n You don’t flinch. Not visibly. But you feel it. The magic buzzes stronger with every word you transcribe. You know it’s happening. You can feel it softening your focus, dulling your thoughts at the edges. The phrases nestle into your mind - *complicated details tend to go over their head* - and part of you starts to believe it.\n\n \n\n The worst part? You’re letting it happen.\n\n \n\n There’s no invisible hand on yours. You just… don’t want to say no to Thompson. You don’t want to see how he’d react if you did. You’re choosing this. That’s what scares you. And as Thompson continues, dictating lines that belittle your intellect, wrap it in faux-praise and backhanded encouragement, you feel something sinking inside you.\n\n \n\n You’ll be fine, you tell yourself. You’re still you.\n\n \n\n *How long can you keep saying that?*\n \n \n You take the seat as Thompson begins speaking. The keys thrum beneath your fingers. Familiar. So familiar.\n\n \n\n “Tell them my secretary will call to confirm,” he dictates. “They are diligent, but gets tangled up in long words sometimes.”\n\n \n\n You nod as you type. No heat in your face. No reflexive frown. These words feel… normal now. Not kind. But expected. It’s only after the letter’s done that you pause. Blink. And realise what just happened. You didn’t wince. You didn’t question it.\n\n \n\n He called you muddled. Slow. And you accepted it like it was a fair observation. The thought sends a chill through you. You’re not under a spell to force you to do this. Not exactly. But Charlton doesn’t just rely on incantations. Just repetition. Expectations. And words.\n\n \n\n Trouble is, you’re starting to believe them.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You hesitate. Just for a second, trying to think of an excuse. “I, uh… I don’t actually know how to type.”\n\n \n\n Thompson stops mid-shuffle of his paperwork. Stares. “What do you mean you don’t know how to type?” His tone is flat. Disbelieving. “That’s all you used to do. As a programmer.”\n\n \n\n You scramble. “It’s different. I mean, keyboards and typewriters. They’re not the same.”\n\n \n\n He snorts. “It’s exactly the same thing.”\n\n \n\n There’s a long silence. You know it’s not a good excuse. You’re not even sure why you said it. Maybe panic. Maybe instinct. Maybe that hum under the keys scared you more than you thought. Thompson eyes you like you’re wasting his time.\n\n \n\n “There’s differences,” you repeat. “Have you tried yourself?” \n\n \n\n “Of course not,” he says immediately, with a scoff. “That’s women’s work.”\n\n \n\n The words linger in the air. They land like a verdict. You realise how Thompson sees this role. How he sees you. Suited. Apt. Like it was always meant to be yours.\n\n The words linger in the air. Heavy. Ugly. Thompson looks back at you, as he himself realises what he’s said. He doesn’t even look at you like a man anymore. For once, you can see a truth behind his eyes.\n\n \n\n Thompson shakes his head. “If you can’t type, you can’t even perform the basics of the job. Maybe I should send you back to school. Get you sat in Business Studies with the girls.”\n\n \n\n He grabs a folder from the desk, then just as quickly tosses it aside. “In the meantime, go to the library. I’m sure they’ve got a book. Learn it. For next time.”\n\n \n\n He waves you out like you’re a waste of his breath. You leave, stomach twisting. You might’ve avoided the typewriter this time. But you know he’s going to keep asking.\n \n \n You see the typewriter. Already humming. Waiting. But you keep your distance. “I haven’t had a chance to get to the library yet,” you say quickly.\n\n \n\n Thompson glares at you. “Stop dithering. Either you want to this job or you don’t.”\n\n \n\n He doesn’t shout. Doesn’t bark. Just lets the disappointment drip from every word. “You’ve been here long enough now. You can’t make excuses forever.”\n\n \n\n He gestures to the door. “Go learn how to type, Phillips. Or I’ll find someone who already can.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Beginning with the basics, you teach Emily how to answer the phones, greet customers, schedule appointments for Clive and Gordon, and manage Thompson’s calendar. You stumble a lot - it’s all new to you – but you get through the basics. None of it is particularly hard. It’s repetitive. Monotonous. Emily picks it up without a challenge.\n\n \n\n Then the bell above the front door rings.\n\n \n\n Dan strolls in, loud as ever. You can smell the alcohol on his breath from across the desk. \"Afternoon,\" he says, grinning.\n\n \n\n Then Dan’s eyes land on Emily. His grin widens. \"Well, well. Look who it is. The elusive Miss Phillips. I was starting to think your kept you locked up somewhere.\"\n\n \n\n You shift uncomfortably. “Emily’s here to do an internship,” you tell him. “I’m just showing her what she needs to do.”\n\n \n\n “Hope you’re better at teaching than you were at keeping Thompson on side,” Dan snarks, a cruel smile forming. “Takes a real alpha to know how to work the old man. It’s all about people skills. Gotta’ have some charm. Looks like your sister got all those genes to herself, though.”\n\n \n\n \n You glance over to your sister, watching Emily squirm back into her seat. She tries to avoid his looks, but he moves to hang over the counter and look directly down at her. \"Come on, just being friendly. In fact,” he says, his face coming closer to Emily’s. “She and I should have a little chat. I can tell her about how things really work around here. And Friday afternoons are so dull.”\n\n \n\n “She’s here to work, Dan,” you tell him flatly. “If Mr. Thompson sees her slacking off, it’ll go straight back to the school.\"\n\n \n\n “Don’t worry about Thompson,” he replies. Then his voice drops, just a little. \"Unless I’m not occupied this afternoon. Then I might find myself in his office. Talking about how her ’s not even managing reception. Shame, really.\"\n\n \n\n He grins at Emily, lingering a second too long, the breath of alcohol invading her face. “What do you say, Miss Phillips? Fancy keeping me occupied?\"\n\n \n\n Emily looks up at him, then to you. Waiting for guidance.\n\n \n You glance over to your sister, but you’re surprised to see her coyly looking up at Dan. A girlish giggle escapes her mouth. Dan hears it and grins. \n\n \n\n “See, she’s okay with a little banter,” he tells you, his predatory eyes not moving from Emily. \"What do you say, Miss. Phillips. Fancy a little chat in the back of the office? I’ll let you know how things really work around here.”\n\n \n\n Before Emily can reply, you interject. “She’s here to work, Dan. If Mr. Thompson sees her slacking off, it’ll go straight back to the school.\"\n\n \n\n “Don’t need to worry about Thompson with me around,” he says, but now his words firmly targeted at Emily. “You’re not as big of a stick in the mud as your , are you? Want to see how the closers celebrate their big deals?”\n\n \n\n Looking over to Emily, you notice her relaxed posture and small grin. She runs a fingernail across her lips before she sees you watching. She quickly drops her hand back to her side, trying to regain some composure.\n\n \n\n “Come on, big . Let her out to play. You wouldn’t leave me alone on a Friday afternoon, would you? I might grow bored and have a chat with Thompson about how well you’re doing on reception. Or how badly you are, to rephrase.”\n\n \n\n Emily looks back at you, waiting for your direction. Her creeping smile at the edge of her mouth tells you what she wants to do, but you are sure nothing good can come of it.\n\n \n \n You spend the afternoon walking Emily through more reception tasks. Calendar reminders, rescheduling calls, chasing up Gordon’s notes. She's still attentive, but less tentative now. Either she’s getting the hang of it… or getting too comfortable.\n\n \n\n The bell chimes. Dan again.\n\n \n\n “Look who’s back,” he grins, slouching against the counter, eyes already drifting to Emily. “Was hoping I’d run into you again, Miss Phillips.”\n\n \n\n \n Emily stiffens. Her fingers hesitate over the keyboard as Dan leans in. “Thought maybe we’d pick up our little chat,” he says, voice low. “You seemed real keen.”\n\n \n\n You cut in quickly. “Emily’s still here to work, Dan.”\n\n \n\n Dan’s smile fades slightly. “She’s allowed a break, isn’t she?” Then, quieter: “Be a shame if I had to fill Thompson in on how the front desk’s been run lately.”\n\n \n\n Emily looks to you. Nervous, expectant. Waiting for your lead.\n\n \n Emily barely looks up from the desk, but there’s a flicker of amusement in her eyes. She toys with her necklace as Dan leans closer.\n\n \n\n “Good to see you’re still around,” he says. “You learn that trick with your necklace from Annie, or are you born this way?”\n\n \n\n She giggles softly.\n\n \n\n “Reckon she’s earned a coffee, don’t you?” Dan asks, not even looking at you now. “Or we could step into the back and talk about her future here.”\n\n \n\n You step in, your tone sharp. “She’s working.”\n\n \n\n Dan shrugs, unbothered. “Your call. But maybe Thompson needs a reminder of how things used to run smoother.”\n\n \n\n Emily gives you a sly look, waiting for permission.\n\n \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n You’ve been waiting too long.\n\n \n\n Whatever Dan wanted to “chat” about, it’s taking more than a few minutes. The front desk feels quieter without Emily nearby, but it’s not in a peaceful way. It’s the kind that tightens your chest. You keep glancing toward the door, hoping to hear footsteps. Nothing.\n\n \n\n Then, at last, the door opens.\n\n \n\n \n Emily steps out, head lowered, cheeks pale. She doesn't speak. You hear Dan's voice bellow out as she walks through the door. \"See you again soon, sweetheart.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes flick to you, but only briefly. Instead she sits down in silence. A long moment passes, but you hear her sigh. \"Alright. What's next?\"\n\n \n\n You open your mouth. “Emily…”\n\n \n\n She cuts you off with a look. \"Don't. He's just a creep. Enough said. You were showing me the filing on the server.\"\n\n \n\n You monotonously walk through the details of how to file documents across the network, but your voice is flat and emotionless. Emily keeps her comments to a minimum, focusing on the work at hand.\n\n \n\n The last hour of the day drips away. Soon, it is time for Emily to leave.\n\n \n\n \"I'll see you at home,\" you say. \"I've got to finish up.\"\n\n \n\n She nods. Then silently picks up her bag and walks out the door without a word.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n The door swings open mid-laugh. Dan’s voice is louder than it needs to be: “Maybe next time, you can show me how you do it.”\n\n \n\n Emily stands in the doorway, looking back over her shoulder into the office. Her voice, lowered and sultry, sings with amusement. “Maybe I will.”\n\n \n\n She saunters back to the desk, cheeks flushed, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. There’s a new bounce in her step, something performative in the way she smooths her skirt and pretends not to notice your stare.\n\n \n\n You lower your voice. “You should be careful with him. He’s not --”\n\n \n\n “He’s not that bad,” she interrupts gently, almost dreamily. “Actually kind of charming, once you get past the bluster.”\n\n \n\n You stare. She flashes you a grin. “I put in a good word for you, by the way. Dan said he might talk to Thompson about giving you a break. Now, where were we.”\n\n \n\n For the next hour you walk her through how to file documents across the network, but her attention is elsewhere. She keeps staring back over to the office door.\n\n \n\n The day soon gets away from you and before you know it, Emily's afternoon has passed.\n\n \n\n \"Thanks for today,\" she says as she picks up her bag. \"And thanks for not being, well, overbearing.\" She grins. \"It's nice to have... some fun.\"\n\n \n\n You watch her go without comment. She bounces over to the door with her grin not leaving her face.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n After some time, you hear the office door creak open. Emily steps out, her face carefully blank. She doesn’t look at you, doesn’t say a word. She walks straight to the desk, drops into the seat, and picks up where she left off like nothing happened.\n\n \n\n For a moment, you just watch her. Eventually, you ask, “Everything okay?”\n\n \n\n She doesn’t look up. “Fine.”\n\n \n\n Taking her at her word, you start to show her some complexity in the calendar scheduling system. She follows along, clicking when told, nodding when expected. There’s no conversation. No connection. Just silence filled with keystrokes.\n\n \n\n As the hour ends, Emily gathers her things.\n\n \n\n “I’ll see you at home,” she says, still not meeting your gaze.\n\n \n\n And she leaves. You glance over to the door, wondering what Dan said to her this time. And how long you'll get the silent treatment from her.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n The door opens with a laugh. Dan’s, loud and satisfied.\n\n \n\n Emily appears a second later, grinning as she steps out. Her cheeks are flushed again. You catch the soft sway of her hips as she walks back to the desk, seemingly unaware of how it looks.\n\n \n\n She slides into her seat, humming something under her breath.\n\n \n\n You keep your voice low. “Be careful with him.”\n\n \n\n Emily just shrugs. “He’s funny. Besides, he said Thompson might be lightening up on you. I told him you’ve been carrying the place.”\n\n \n\n You blink, unsure what to say.\n\n \n\n But she’s already leaning back in her chair, half-listening as you try to walk her through filing protocols. She keeps glancing toward the door, as if half-expecting Dan to call her back in.\n\n \n\n Eventually, after another hour passes, she stands and grabs her bag.\n\n \n\n “Catch you later,” she says breezily, already moving for the door. “Same time next week?”\n\n \n\n The door clicks shut behind her.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n Dan finally gets the hint, wordlessly leaving and the door swings shut behind him with a smug little click. Silence fills the front office again. Not peace, but pressure.\n\n \n\n You and Emily don’t speak at first.\n\n \n\n Eventually, you clear your throat and gesture to the screen. “We should get back to the scheduling interface. You were asking about recurring appointments?”\n\n \n\n She nods, wordlessly. You ease back into the teaching.\n\n \n\n \n Emily follows along, if a little slowly. Her focus isn’t quite there, and you can see her glancing now and then at the door Dan walked through. More out of dread than distraction.\n\n \n\n You guide her through the double-booking system and how Clive prefers phone confirmation on anything marked 'tentative.' She listens. She's trying. She doesn't say much, but when she does, her voice is steady.\n\n \n\n By the end of the hour, she’s moving with more confidence again. As she gathers her things, she pauses beside you.\n\n \n\n “Thanks,” she says. “For stepping in. I didn’t… I didn’t want to be alone with him.”\n\n \n\n A beat passes. “I mean, not just because of him. But… I’m glad you had my back.”\n\n \n\n Then, softly, “I’ll see you at home.”\n\n \n\n She smiles and opens the door, stepping out into Charlton.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n\n \n Emily takes her seat, but her posture is closed. You resume your explanation, but she’s barely engaging. Her replies are clipped. Her fingers tap impatiently at the edge of the desk when you pause.\n\n \n\n You walk her through the internal memo process, but she doesn’t seem to be listening. When you ask her to repeat something back, she sighs and leans back. “I’m not an idiot. I know how to send a stupid email.”\n\n \n\n You give her a look. “I’m just trying to help you learn.”\n\n \n\n “I am learning. But I don’t need you hovering every second like I’m some clueless little kid.”\n\n \n\n After an hour passes, you have not gotten much further. Emily seems reluctant to learn, almost purposefully derailing your teaching.\n\n \n\n \"Everything okay?\" you try, as the day draws to a close.\n\n \n\n She sighs. “You wouldn't understand,\" she mutters. \"I just want to have some fun. Not sitting behind a desk. Following the rules.”\n\n \n\n Her expression softens, only slightly. “I’m not you.”\n \n\n She grabs her bag and stands, moving towards the door. “I’ll see you at home.”\n\n \n\n The door closes gently. But firmly.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n Dan’s exit is a little less dramatic this time, but no less unwanted. The door shuts. Silence returns.\n\n \n\n You look over to Emily. “Calendar system?” She gives the faintest nod.\n\n \n\n \n She listens quietly as you walk her through the process again. She asks fewer questions this time. Not out of boredom. Just restraint.\n\n \n\n There’s a heaviness to her silence, but not bitterness. Just tiredness. She finishes the tasks without fuss.\n\n \n\n When the hour ends, she picks up her bag.\n\n \n\n “Thanks, ,” she says simply. “For again keeping him out of my face.”\n\n \n\n And she leaves.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n Emily slouches back in her chair as you begin, not bothering to pretend she’s interested. Her eyes glaze over halfway through the example booking flow.\n\n \n\n After trying for some time, you stop explaining. \"Do we have a problem?\"\n\n \n\n She lets out a quiet snort. “No, no problem. Not at all. Just once again, I’m not allowed to have any fun.”\n\n \n\n No eye contact. No thank-you. Just that.\n\n \n\n She stands, pulls her bag over her shoulder, and walks out without another word.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

The phone stopped ringing five minutes ago, and you’ve just started sorting through emails when the door swings open behind you.\n\n \n\n Dan strides in, loosening his tie like he’s just stormed out of a courtroom drama.\n\n \n\n “Annie,” he says, exasperated. “Is there any reason I just walked out of a meeting without the damn contract notes?”\n\n \n\n You blink. “I haven’t touched the system,” you say, careful to keep your tone light.\n\n \n\n He barks a laugh. “Course you haven’t. Would’ve noticed - there weren't emojis in my meeting invite.”\n\n \n\n You say nothing. He’s already pacing. “Theodore’s mangled the code again. No tags, no trail, no quote. I’ve got a client waiting to sign and nothing to show but my charming personality. Which normally gets the job done. Today though, I needed the paperwork.”\n\n \n\n He points vaguely at nothing. “I told Thompson this would happen. You can’t fire the one bloke holding the place together and expect it not to fall over. Phillips knew how to keep a pipeline clean. Mostly.”\n\n \n\n That last bit hangs in the air. That was most definitely something he didn't say.\n\n \n\n He flops into the visitor chair, leering at your legs as he does so. “Honestly, if someone in this place had half a brain, I’d propose. But until then, I guess I’m stuck doing everything myself.”\n\n \n\n This is it. Your moment. You could push now and plant the idea of Dan having a word with Thompson about getting you rehired.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n \n [Saucy Secretary] <>\n\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n <>\n\n <>\n \n <>\n \n \n \n The front desk is quiet when Dan barrels in, phone in one hand, sunglasses in the other. It doesn't matter that it's permanently overcast in Charlton.\n\n \n\n “Annie,” he announces, like he's walking into a courtroom. “Is there a reason I just spent ten minutes trying to schedule a meeting only to discover that the calendar app thinks our client lives in a parking lot?”\n\n \n \n You blink, caught off guard. “I haven’t touched the system,” you offer.\n\n \n\n He stops, dramatically sighs, and slides his sunglasses up onto his head. Despite the dim lighting.\n\n \n\n \"Of course you didn't,\" he replies. \"You don't need to worry your pretty little head with business. What I need is for Phillips to explain what the hell they think they're doing. Where are they?\"\n\n \n\n \"I'm not sure,\" you reply, trying to assess the situation.\n\n \n\n “Well,\" he says, dramatically pulling his glasses down to look over the rim. \"If you see them, tell them I’m grabbing lunch with Thompson.

I'm Emily. I'm supposed to start an internship today.\"\n\n \n\n The internship...\n\n \n\n Emotions flutter inside you. Shame. Embarrassment. An odd sensation where your mind is trying to make sense of what feels like a dream. But you push it all down. \"Sure,\" you reply. \"Take a seat.\"\n\n \n\n You gesture to the visitors chair. Emily puts her bag neatly underneath the reception desk and sits down, waiting expectedly.\n\n \n Emily grins, strolling around the counter with confidence and purpose. She tosses her bag behind the counter and leans casually against the computer. \"Hey! Annie, right? I love your dress. Where did you get it?\"\n\n \n\n \"Emily...\" you begin, but realisation hits you. The internship...\n\n \n\n You take a gulp. \"Evans,\" you mutter.\n\n \n\n \"I didn't know that sold skirts that short,\" Emily whispers to you, grinning. \"But if you've got it, you might as well flaunt it.\"\n\n \n\n \"You're here for the internship?\" you ask her, playing for time.\n\n \n\n She shrugs. \"I mean, I'd much rather get your advice on how to find bargains at Evans. But sure. Where do we begin?\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Emily smiles meekly at you, still feeling uncomfortable being here. She walks around the desk and pops her school bag down, then hangs awkwardly off to the side.\n\n \n\n \"So. What are we doing today?\" she asks.\n\n \n Emily grins at the sight of you, but strolls in with confidence and purpose. She tosses her bag behind the counter and leans casually against the computer. \"Hey Annie! Another day of manning phones and talking to beefy tradesmen. That reminds me, I don't suppose Dan is around, is he?\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes wander. You move the mouse, bringing the monitor back to life, trying to make a point. \"Oh,\" she exclaims. \"Right. Work.\"\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n You are working the reception inbox, responding to customer’s queries, when a message pops up on your screen.\n\n \n\n Need you in my office. Now.\n \n\n You stop what you're doing and stand up, knowing full well not to risk Thompson’s wrath. You walk through into the office - where you used to work - and step up to the door. In an instant you hear Thompson’s voice bellow. “Enter!”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \n **Thompson Handyman Repairs - Reception**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Reception.png]\n\n \n\n The day draws to a close.\n\n \n\n You shut down the computer, logging out of systems and wiping down the dusty monitor. You glance over to the office and see light seeping out from underneath the door. Someone is still working.\n\n \n\n Which is just as well, as Annie didn't give you her set of keys.\n \n \n\n Flicking off the desk lamp, you gather your belongings and exit, grateful for the end of the working day.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

Hey.\" She smiles, but it doesn’t quite reach her eyes. There’s something careful about the way she watches you, like she’s trying to gauge your intentions before deciding how to respond.\n\n As you approach, her expression is unreadable. \"Hey.\" She gives you a polite smile, but you can see in her expression that her mind is on other things that you can’t draw her away from.\n\n As you approach, she perks up slightly, shifting in her seat to face you properly. \"Hey ! Got a minute?\" There’s an easy familiarity in the way she greets you, as if she’s relieved to have you around.\n\n As you approach she beams, setting aside whatever she was doing without hesitation. \"! How are you?\" Her voice is warm, her expression open. There’s no guard, no hesitation.

He offers you an easy grin. “Hey,” he says as he steps inside, eyes lingering on you.\n\n \n\n You lead him to the kitchen table. He sets the books down but keeps his gaze on you, flipping open his notebook with deliberate slowness. “So,” you prompt, “which problems are giving you trouble?”\n\n \n\n He leans forward, the book angled so he can sneak peeks at your face between the equations. “This one,” he says, tapping the page. But then his finger trails off as he catches your eye, smiling. “But honestly, I’m more interested in the teacher than the question.”\n\n \n\n You ignore his words and show him the steps through the problems. He nods, but he also reaches out, brushing the back of his hand against yours when he turns the page. “Wow, that actually makes sense,” he murmurs, voice low. “I could listen to you explain math all evening.”\n\n \n\n He closes the notebook with a soft thud and meets your gaze directly. “Mind if I take a short break? Maybe… chat a bit?”\n\n \n A little time passes before the doorbell rings. You usher your sister up to her room to avoid any complications and answer the door. Terrence stands awkwardly outside, a number of books stacked up in his hands. “Hey,” he nervously says to you.\n\n \n\n You invite him in and the two of you sit down at the kitchen table. He looks around, surveying the living space cautiously. “Nice house,” he comments after some time, as he finally relaxes.\n\n \n\n “So,” you begin. “What areas of maths are you struggling with?”\n\n \n\n Terrence opens an exercise book and talks you through some of the maths exercises that are proving challenging for him. You are happy that it not only seems simple to you, but that you can see where he’s tripping up.\n\n \n\n Time passes as Terrence diligently follows your tutorage. With a little encouragement, he soon improves. For the first time since talking with him, he seems calm.\n\n \n\n \n Terrence perches on the edge of the kitchen chair, book open but eyes lifting from the equations to meet yours with a warm, teasing smile.\n\n \n Terrence fidgets on the kitchen table chair, trying to focus on his book.\n\n \n\n**Actions**\n\n<>\n\n<>\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n<>\n\n<>\n\n<>",

No longer is Emily just another person. Something has permanently changed in your mind. Even if it's just a memory, you feel in some way that you are looking at a reflection of you.\n\n \n\n \"Good thanks,\" you reply, pushing the uncanny feeling aside in your mind. \"Or as well as can be expected.\"\n\n \n\n She nods, silent. Then looks down at the table, not meeting your eyes. \"So. What do you want to do today?\"\n\n \n\n You mull over your response. \"I'm not even sure I know where to begin, Em,\" you begin. \"This time yesterday I thought we lived in a world where magic was something in fantasy books and kids' tales. And now this.\" You take out the amulet from your pocket, showing Emily its shining brilliance.\n\n \n\n She looks between the amulet and you. \"You could try finding out more about that amulet. Where Liz got it from and how it works.\"\n\n \n\n You look at Emily, quizzically. \"Do you have her number?\"\n\n \n\n Emily shakes her head. \"But she'll be at school today. Plus, we need to understand what's happening at school.\"\n\n \n\n \"You want me to transform again and go back again today, don't you?\" you ask her.\n \n \n\n She bites her lip, saying nothing.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n You sigh and start to talk. \"This isn't an easy decision, but I think it's best if I go to work. We need to keep up appearances. I can investigate the town to see if I can find anything about magic, the amulet or the school whilst you go there today.\n\n \n\n Emily's eyes glisten, but she holds back tears. She nods. \"I understand,\" she murmurs.\n\n \n\n \"Just keep your wits about you and try to avoid anything that feels odd,\" you say, trying to provide comfort. \"Until we know more about what is going on, we have to assume that anything you do or say at school could have an effect on you.\"\n\n \n\n \"I'll try,\" she says, standing up. She picks up her school satchel from the kitchen table and puts it on.\n\n \n \n “Have a good day at school,” you say as she moves to the door. “I’ll see you after work.”\n\n \n\n She nods, and walks out the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “Let’s get this over with,” you tell Emily. “Give me your lipgloss.” \n\n \n\n Emily’s eyes widen and she smiles gratefully. She hurriedly rifles through her school satchel and hands over the lipgloss - a now treasured possession for her. You are sure the school’s effects had something to do with this. You hope it doesn’t have the same impact on you.\n\n \n\n “Just remember,” Emily says. “Liz gave me that amulet. Try and find her. From the sounds of what she said to you, she knows more than she’s told either of us.”\n\n \n\n You nod and take the lipgloss from her. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Now form shape to the person I see within.”\n\n \n\n The emerald warms your chest against your shirt as you picture her. You take a breath and not a moment later you feel warm energy pulsate out from the emerald and spread across your body.\n\n \n\n Your hair stands up on edge as the pain cascades across your skin. You hold on to the mental picture of Emily. Her slender figure. Fair complexion. Her large expressive brown eyes. Her hair, straight and long.\n\n \n \nYou picture Emily's increased chest size and decreased height, remembering the changes Nurse Rancy made. You visualise how her uniform fits differently now. Tighter across the bust, looser at the hem. How she seems to take up less space, but draw more attention. A compact, exaggerated version of herself.\n\n \n \nYou picture Emily's increased chest size, remembering the changes Nurse Rancy made. You visualise how her shirt now clings more tightly to her bust, the weight altering her posture just slightly.\n\n \n \nYou picture Emily’s decreased height, remembering the changes Nurse Rancy made. You visualise how she now stands just that bit smaller. Unmistakably petite. You recall the way her feet barely touched the floor when she sat, or how she looked up at taller boys with a softened gaze.\n\n \n \n\n You squeal as you feel your bones crunching and your skin changing again, but you push against the pain. You hear yourself shriek in agony in a pitch that belongs to Emily's voice. Then the pain suddenly vanishes, leaving only your heavy breathing as your chest rises and lowers underneath your new clothes.\n\n \n\n You glance over at the mirror and see a perfect copy of Emily, staring back at you. You feel smaller, more fragile. A little less *assertive*. And you notice that your *intelligence* seems sluggish. Thoughts that came quickly now seem to take a tiny bit longer.\n\n \n\n \n You lean over and pick up her backpack that she carries around at the weekends. You're ready for the day ahead.\n\n You lean over and pick up Emily's satchel to complete the look. You're ready for school today.\n\n \n You lean over and pick up her backpack that she carries around at the weekends.\n\n You lean over and pick up Emily's satchel to complete the look. Looking like you just got home from school.\n\n \n\n You put the necklace around your neck and clutch Emily's lipgloss. You feel the energy of the amulet around your neck, but it feels faint and weak. \n\n \n\n You visualise Emily in your mind and speak the words from the note. The emerald warms slightly, but its energy crackles only momentarily before sputtering out. \n\n \n\n You remember Liz’s words about the amulet needing time to recharge. As certain as you can be about anything right now, you’d bet that you need to wait a little more time before it can be used again.\n\n**Actions**\n\n<>",

Smooth and clear of etchings or symbols. But focusing your mind on it, you recognise the tingling properties of magic infused within its elements.\n\n \n\n You ponder what Jen said. If Emily wore it to school, you are sure it would in some part help her resist the curses at school. But your thoughts also consider how you could use it to resist the same effects. Certainly it would help diminish the impact of the school on you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n “Hey Em,” you say to your sister. “I’ve got something for you.”\n\n \n\n You hold out your hand, revealing the ring in your palm.

Allow you to concentrate.”\n\n \n\n She eyes it for a moment, unsure. “Are there any side effects?”\n\n \n\n “Not that I know of,” you say, shaking your head. “Just protection. Against the effects of the school.”\n\n \n\n “Where did you get it?” she asks you.\n\n \n\n “A friend,” you reply, avoiding revealing too much about what you discussed with Jennifer. “Don’t worry. I trust them.”\n\n \n\n She nods and takes the ring from your palm, sliding it on. When she’s assured that nothing unexpected has occurred, she smiles politely at you. “Thank you.” \n\n \n\n “No problem,” you say. She begins fiddling with the ring. You decide to let her be.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You slip the ring on to your own finger. Through means of magic or pure coincidence, it perfectly fits you.\n\n \n\n The magic emanates from the ring out across your body, warming your skin. The sensation subsides quickly, leaving only a lingering shiver as the ring seems to pulsate energy out of its metal.\n\n \n\n You feel a slight surge of confidence rush through you. As if there's something protecting you. It takes a few moments to become accustomed to it, before it fades into the background of your body’s regular functions and feelings.\n\n \n\n Emily continues with what she was doing beforehand, oblivious. And still protected from the curses at Charlton school.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Being a girl doesn’t float your boat, then?”\n\n \n\n “How could I use the amulet if I was a guy?” you quiz her, trying to make sense of what she’s telling you. \n\n \n\n She shrugs a little. “Everything I’ve read says that there are some people with magical affinity, who can use magic. Emily,” she gestures over to your sister, “doesn’t have it. I can sense it.” She offers Emily a smile. “Sorry, hun.” \n\n \n\n “But you do,” Liz says, turning back to you and grinning. “It’s just that… well, you need to be a woman to tap into it. Those are the rules, I’m afraid. Or as far as I know.”\n\n \n\n “This is ridiculous,” you say. If only to yourself. \n\n \n\n Liz leans into you, grinning. “But fortunately for you, we have a sneaky get-out-of-jail card up our sleeves, don’t we? Is the amulet charged? Want to use it again, ?”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \n Thirty minutes after calling, the doorbell rings. You stand up and answer the door.\n\n \n\n “Oh, hi *Emily*,” Liz says as you open it. She bounds in.\n\n \n\n She takes in her surroundings and sees Emily, sitting on the sofa. Her eyes dart between the two of you, her eyes wide. “Oh my god. You could be twins.”\n\n \n\n You shift uneasily on the spot at her drawing attention to the situation. She notices the silence in the air and the wonder diminishes a little from her face, but her grin remains.\n\n \n\n “So, are you ready to learn some magic?” she asks you. “Or have you got some more questions for me?”\n\n \n\n “I have a question,” you hear Emily say. “Why?”\n\n \n\n You both look at Emily, still sitting on the sofa. Her expression is unreadable, but you can hear a slight tremor in a voice. “What did you do this to ?” she clarifies.\n\n \n\n Liz moves over to the sofa and sits down with Emily. “Listen Em, I had no idea. I was just trying to find something to help you. I didn’t even think it would work.”\n\n \n\n “But why ?” Emily says with tears in her eyes. “Why put through this? Why not try it on me.”\n\n \n\n On this point, Liz looks over at you. “Because can use it. And you can’t.”\n\n \n\n “I don’t know all of how this works,” Liz continues, turning back to Emily. “Or even a lot of it, for that matter. But one thing I read, and I now think it’s true, is that only certain people have magical affinity. I can sense it. You don’t, hun. I’m sorry.”\n\n \n\n Emily looks from her to you, then back again. “But does?”\n\n \n\n \n Liz nods and glances at you once more. “I think magic is linked to souls. Like your sisters. So even when she's you, she can still perform magic. Good job you’ve taken to Emily's form, !” \n \n \n Liz nods and glances at you once more. “I think magic is linked to souls. Like your brothers. And even then, you have to be a woman to learn and use it. He can use magical items, but he wouldn’t be able to cast a spell as . Come to think of it, I should have really mentioned that. Good job you’ve taken to remaining a girl, !” \n\n \n \n\n You give her a look and again she shifts uneasily, returning back to focus on Emily. “I promise I’ll help ,” she says. “That’s why I’m here, after all.” \n\n \n\n Liz looks back at you. “So, Em, do you still want to learn some magic?\"\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n\n Liz beams and rushes over to you. “Alright, this will take some time. I’m going to teach you a few basics, so you can channel your energy into a spell. Then once you’re ready, you’ll need to say some words, and with any luck, your target will fall into a restful sleep and be none the wiser.”\n\n \n\n You look at Liz. “And who is going to be my target?”\n\n \n\n Liz looks back at Emily. You hear your sister sigh.\n\n \n\n “It can’t be me,” Liz protests. “What if something goes wrong?”\n\n \n\n “Are you such a good witch that you could do something if it does?” Emily asks her.\n\n \n\n Liz smiles apologetically and shrugs.\n\n \n\n “Fine,” Emily says. “Try your little spell on me.”\n\n \n\n Liz guides you over to the living room rug, motioning for you to sit down. You relax and for what seems like hours Liz talks you through meditative techniques that teach you to breathe in… and breathe out.\n\n \n\n Except, you admit, there’s a feeling. Something inside you, warming your lungs. At first its a flicker, then a spark. As you concentrate on the feeling, the energy grows warmer and consistent. You feel a rush of euphoria, an ever-growing sensation, a connection flowing through your organs.\n\n \n\n “Can you feel it?” you hear Liz say. “Can you sense magic?”\n\n \n\n You nod, trying not to lose your concentration. But now you’re aware of it, it only grows stronger.\n\n \n\n “Now,” Liz says firmly. “Open your eyes, and concentrate on your sister. Repeat after me. “Fall asleep, and let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Liz looks disappointed, but nods. “I understand. This is a lot to take in.” For once, she seems genuine and considerate of the situation’s magnitude.\n\n \n\n “I won’t force you to do anything you don’t want to do,” she continues. “But if you change your mind, just give me a call. Think it over this evening and we can try again another night.”\n\n \n\n She walks over to the front door and looks back to you and Emily. “Goodnight. I’ll see you at school. At least, I’ll see one of you.”\n\n \n\n She leaves. You look back to Emily, who gives you a look you can’t read, before turning back to the TV. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n You look between Liz and Emily, then shrug. “Alright, I’ll do it.” You ignore Liz’s squeal of joy. \n\n \n\n Taking out the amulet, you put it around your neck clutch Emily's lipgloss, bracing yourself. The amulet tingles, already an almost familiar feeling by now.\n\n \n\n Liz watches you, wide-eyed. She says nothing, but her grin betrays her excitement.\n\n \n\n “Here we go again,” you mutter. And you begin to speak the words as you picture Emily in your mind.\n\n \n\n “From this item, I see you in your time of need. Now form shape to the person I see within.”\n\n \n\n The amulet’s emerald warms your chest and only a heartbeat passes as energy pulsates out across your body. Your hair stands up and pain courses across your skin. Holding on to the mental picture of Emily, you shriek as your bones crunch and your skin changes. The pitch of your voice grows higher, your chest expands, and your penis contracts into your body. \n\n \n\n Then the pain suddenly vanishes. You stand firm, breathing deeply, your breasts rising and falling under your school uniform. \n\n \n\n Liz laughs with joy. “Oh. My. God. Look at you!” \n\n \n\n She circles you, her eyes darting across your new form. “I mean, I knew what you did. But this. Seeing this. It’s… wonderful.”\n\n \n\n You look at her, unsure of what to say. Then over to Emily, who casually looks at you, seemingly already used to your transformations.\n\n \n\n “Well,” Liz continues, beaming. “You now certainly look like you’re ready to learn magic. Ready to start?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n You put the necklace around your neck and clutch Emily's lipgloss. You feel the energy of the amulet around your neck, but it feels faint and weak.\n\n \n\n You visualise Emily in your mind and speak the words from the note. The emerald warms slightly, but its energy crackles only momentarily before sputtering out.\n\n \n\n Liz stares back at you, glancing at the emerald in the amulet. “Is it broken?” she asks.\n\n \n\n “I think it just needs more time to recharge,” you tell her. “I don’t think I’ll be changing this evening.”\n\n \n\n She pouts, but Liz nods. “Alright, that’s frustrating. But it is what it is. Maybe call me tomorrow, or any evening when you’re free. As soon as the amulet is ready, I’ll come over.”\n\n \n\n You nod. Liz walks over to the door. “See you later, *Em’s*,” she says as she leaves.\n\n \n\n Sitting down next to Emily, you watch TV as your thoughts dwell on what Liz has asked of you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Liz sighs. After a long moment, she looks back at you. “I suppose I get it. It’s not as if you’ve had time to adjust. It’s just that there’s not many people who have your potential. Is being a girl so bad for you?”\n\n \n\n She looks between you and Emily, before continuing. “I won’t force you to do anything. For one, I really need your help. But time is a-ticking, **. Going to school isn’t getting any easier. If you won’t do it for me, then…” She glances over your sister. “Consider what’s best for Em.”\n\n \n\n She walks over to the front door, then looks back at you. “If you change your mind, just give me a call. Think it over this evening and we can try again another night.”\n\n \n\n She leaves without waiting for an answer. You watch her leave, then sit down with Emily in front of the TV. She gives you a look, but says nothing. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You repeat the words as Liz instructed you, staring at your sister, noting her worried face.\n\n \n\n With a rush of energy, you feel the warm aura within you shoot from your body and envelop Emily. Her eyes widen, and without pause she slumps over on the sofa.\n\n \n\n Realising what you have done, you rush over to her. You shake her gently, but she doesn’t stir. Her deep sleep can not be interrupted, her shallow breath the only telling sign she’s peacefully asleep.\n\n \n\n “Hey! It’s okay! *She’s* okay,” Liz says, kneeling beside you. “It worked!”\n\n \n\n You check her pulse to make sure. Her heartbeat is slow, but steady. Despite how she came to be in this state, she’s just asleep.\n\n \n\n “I don’t believe it,” you mutter.\n\n \n\n “Welcome to a wider world,” Liz replies. “How do you feel?”\n\n \n\n You spend a moment reflecting. The inner energy swirls inside your body, no longer requiring meditation or chanting. You can sense its power. Now you are aware of it, you are sure you will never be without it.\n\n \n\n “How long will she be out for?” you ask Liz. \n\n \n\n “A couple of hours,” she replies. “Maybe longer. If you feel charitable, I’d put her to bed. She’ll wake up refreshed. I promise.”\n\n \n\n You nod and with Liz’s help carry Emily up to her room, laying her down in bed. After double checking to make sure she’s okay, you return back downstairs.\n\n \n\n “So, what now?” you ask Liz. She shrugs. \n\n \n\n “That’s all I know,” she tells you. “But it’s nothing compared to whatever is happening at school. The old woman at the junk shop might be able to help you more. And I’m here, if you need anything.”\n\n \n\n You look at Liz. For the first time she seems tired and flat. You find yourself smile at her in an attempt to reassure her.\n\n \n\n “I better get going,” she says. “It’s getting late. But if you need anything, you know where to find me. At school during the week, or at the library during the weekend if you would prefer to avoid school. I’ll help anyway I can, **.\n\n \n\n She smiles and sees herself out, leaving you alone in your living room. Thinking about your next move. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

After three rings, you hear a voice similar to Elizabeth’s answer, but older.\n\n \n\n “Uh, is Liz there?”\n\n \n\n \n “Oh hey Emily!” the person replies. “Liz is just in her room. I’ll go get her.”\n\n \n\n Liz’s voice comes on the line momentarily. “Oh hey *Emily*,” she says dramatically. You can only imagine that she’s playing to a crowd at her end. “What’s up?”\n\n \n\n “I’m free this evening, if you want to come over and learn about curses,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “Sure, I’ll come over and help you with your homework,” she replies. “I’ll be right there.”\n\n \n\n You hang up.

    "text": "About half-an-hour goes by before the doorbell rings. You let Liz in, who bounces in with enthusiasm. “Hey Em! Where’s your twin sister?”\n\n \n\n “She’s up in her room,” you reply, before realising that you’ve grown to accept Liz’s jibes. Do I really think of Emily as my twin now?\n\n \n\n “Probably for the best,” Liz says. “After all, we wouldn’t want a civilian getting hit by stray magic. Especially something as powerful as a curse.”\n\n \n\n The seriousness of what you’re practising is either lost on Liz or she is too blinded by enthusiasm to worry. Not for the first time, you question whether teaching her how to play with curses is really a good idea.\n\n \n\n “Alright. Let’s get comfortable,” you say, pulling back the coffee room table to give you room to meditate. \n\n \n\n “It looks like you’re making space for a slumber party,” Liz remarks. “Just us girls though, right?”\n\n \n\n “Are you going to take this seriously?” you snap. \n\n \n\n Liz forcefully wipes the smile from her face. Nods. You take a seat on the floor and she joins you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “We’ll start by breathing in and out,” you tell Liz. “Close your eyes, and focus on your breathing.”\n\n \n\n She looks like she’s about to make a comment, but thinks twice about it and instead follows your instructions. Minutes pass as you watch her drop into a meditative state. You begin to sense the innate magical powers building within her body.\n\n \n\n “Try to reach out,” you tell her. “That feeling inside you. Try to find it elsewhere.”\n\n \n\n Elizabeth nods, her typical crooked grin minimal. You can feel her mind’s eye turning out from her body, gazing across the room. With a tingle, it rests on you.\n\n \n\n “Found you,” she murmurs, smiling.\n\n \n\n You pause, thinking of the next step, realising you’ve forgotten the vital ingredient. Nothing in your living room is cursed. \n\n \n\n As you consider what to do, the tingling sensation of Liz’s focus roves across your body. You suddenly shudder, as a jolt hits your chest. The amulet.\n\n \n\n “It’s so pretty,” Liz says. You gasp, feeling her affinity probing the object that hangs around your neck.\n\n \n\n “Don’t,” you tell her. But you already can feel her mind gently nudging the energies flowing within the amulet. \n\n \n\n “Have you got a better option?” she asks, her crooked smile rising. “You did promise.”\n\n \n\n You sigh. “Just be careful, okay.”\n\n \n\n “Hey!” she retorts. “It’s me.”\n\n \n\n Liz’s mental probing continues to prod at the amulet. You look down to see the yellow embers of magic bubbling inside of its gem.\n\n \n\n “Okay,” you say, relenting. “Repeat after me. I cause this object with power beyond its power. Unseen and unheard, its effects will be felt by…” you consider the best phrasing. “All who wear it.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n\n Liz repeats the words you told her. It’s a trickle at first, but soon you can feel the energies of the amulet break apart, sizzling like meat grilling on the stove.\n\n \n\n “I think that’s enough,” you say. But Liz doesn’t respond.\n\n \n\n You look down, seeing the yellow strands of magic circling around the gem in the amulet. A few stray beads drift off into the air, disappearing from your enhanced sight. \n\n \n\n “Liz!” you say, loudly. \n\n \n\n “Don’t distract me,” she snaps back at you.\n\n \n\n Thankfully, although slowly, the embers begin to reform into a shape, enclosed inside the gem. You feel the chaos of the raw magic fade, contained once more.\n\n \n\n Liz opens her eyes, blinking as she adjusts back to reality. “That was epic,” she murmurs.\n\n \n\n You look down at the amulet hanging around your chest and pull it out for closer inspection. Nothing seems different. Yet. You can sense a subtle shift in its power. More potent. Has Liz messing around with it made it stronger?\n\n \n\n “That was reckless,” you spit, turning your attention back to Liz. “What would I have done if you broke it?”\n\n \n\n Liz shrugs her shoulders. “Well I guess all those jokes about you being Emily’s twin sister wouldn’t be very funny anymore,” she tries.\n\n \n\n You throw her a look. “I think you should leave,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “Come on, !” she says, making a point of using your name. “No harm, no foul. And I’ll make sure I put on a show for Prichard when you need me.”\n\n \n\n “You better,” you tell her darkly.\n\n \n\n “I will,” she says, grinning. “Now, I’ve got some experimenting to do. See ya’ at school!”\n\n \n\n Liz leaps to her feet. Within a moment, she’s out the door. \n\n \n\n You turn your attention briefly to the amulet again. It definitely feels more powerful.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "Deciding it’s time to decide what to do about Christina’s final test, you give Liz a call. The phone is promptly picked up and you hear Liz’s voice. “Hello?”\n \n\n \n \n \n “Hey Liz” you say. “It’s .”\n\n \n\n “Oh. Hey ,” she replies, surprised. “What’s up?”\n\n \n ”Hey Liz,” you say. “It’s .”\n\n \n\n “Don’t you mean Emily?” she replies, a hint of playfulness in her tone. “Is getting really hard to tell you two apart these days.

From through the phone, Liz laughs. “What’s up?”\n\n \n “Hey Liz,” you say. “It’s .”\n\n \n\n There is a marked pause before Liz replies. “You don’t sound like .”\n\n \n\n “I’m trying a new look,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “Oh. Experimenting some more, are we ?” A small playful laugh comes down the line. “Colour me intrigued. What’s up?”\n\n \n \n\n “I was wondering if you’d like to come over?” you tell her. “I’ve been doing some investigating. I think I’ve found something that we should talk about.”\n\n \n\n “Oh really!” you hear Liz say. “Sounds delicious. I’m just having dinner with my parents, but I’ll be right over after that. Okay?”\n\n \n\n “Sure. I’ll see you soon.”\n\n \n\n You say goodbye and hang up.

    "text": "“I’ve got some things to discuss with Liz,” you say. “Some personal things.”\n\n \n\n Emily looks at you, darkly. \"This is magical stuff again, isn't it?”\n\n \n\n You nod. Emily grinds her teeth. \"I hate all this stuff,\" she mutters. \"It's so unfair.\"\n\n \n\n “If it makes you feel any better, I wish I'd never heard of any of it,\" you try.\n\n \n\n Emily glares at you, in spite of herself. \"It doesn't. It just makes me wish I could use it instead of you.\"\n\n \n\n Tension hangs in the air. She stands up from the sofa and walks up the stairs. “Enjoy,” she says sarcastically.\n\n \n\n You hear Emily’s door shut, harder than usual.\n \n \n “I’ve got some things to discuss with Liz,” you say. “Some personal things.”\n\n \n\n Emily frowns, looking confused. Then the smallest hint of a smile appears on her face. “You want me to leave you two alone?”\n\n \n\n “It’s nothing like that,” you correct her. But she gives you a sceptical look.\n\n \n\n “I’m sure your girlfriend would see it exactly like that,” Emily replies. “Don’t do anything stupid. I really like Jennifer.”\n\n \n\n “It’s not like that, Em,” you try. “I just have some things to talk through with her.”\n\n \n\n Emily raises an eyebrow, but relents. She stands up from the sofa and walks up the stairs. “Whatever you say. Have a good night.”\n\n \n\n You hear Emily’s door shut, harder than usual.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \"I need to talk to her,\" you begin. “About the cheerleaders.”\n\n \n\n Emily looks at you, curious. “What about them?”\n\n \n\n You brace yourself. “They’re behind the curses at the school. Christina tried to recruit me – well, you – into their coven.”\n\n \n\n Your sister stares back at you, visibly trying to come to terms with what you’re saying. “What have you been doing at school when you pretend to be me, ?”\n\n \n\n “I’m close, Em,” you deflect, not wanting to get into everything you’ve done at Charlton School as her. “Real close. If I can get in with them, I can figure out what they are doing. I can stop them.”\n\n \n\n Emily mulls this over for a few moments. “And what’s Liz got to do with this?” \n\n \n\n “As a final test, Christina asked me to wipe Liz’s knowledge of magic.”\n\n \n\n This grabs Emily’s attention. “You’re not going to do that, are you?”\n\n \n\n “Of course not,” you tell her. “But we need to think of a plan so Christina believes I’ve done it.”\n\n \n\n Emily considers this, gazing off to the side as she becomes lost in thought. Finally, she stands. “I don’t like this, . I don’t like it one bit. I need some time to think.”\n\n \n\n She walks towards the stairs, heading to her room. Halfway up, she turns back to you. “Try to remember that when you’re at school, you’re me. Whatever you’re doing, you're playing with my life. My reputation.”\n\n \n\n A moment later, you hear Emily slam her door.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n \n \n Not long after, the doorbell rings. You open the front door to see Liz standing on the porch, a crooked smile on her face as she sees you.\n\n \n\n \n ”Oh hey ,” she says. “I didn’t recognise you for a second. Done something with your hair?”\n\n \n ”Hey ‘Em’. Don’t you look nice today. Like a whole new you.”\n\n \n “Hello,” Liz says, looking you up and down. “You’re really pushing the boundaries, aren’t you ? This is… amazing.”\n\n \n \n\n You gesture Liz inside. She bounds in, her ankle boots clicking on the floor. \n\n \n\n Throwing herself down onto the sofa, she looks back at you. “So. What’s new?”\n\n \n\n Standing nearby, you look at Liz. There’s no audience here. No one to see what you’re doing. It’s now time to decide what to do.\n\n \n Not long after, the doorbell rings. You open the front door to see Liz standing on the porch, glaring at you.\n\n \n\n \n ”,” she says, curtly. \n\n \n “, I presume?” Liz says, looking you up and down.\n\n \n \n\n You gesture Liz inside. She cautiously walks in, her ankle boots clicking on the floor. \n\n \n\n You close the door and turn back to the living room. Liz walks over to the sofa and sits down, looking at you with burning hostility. \n\n \n\n “So,” she says. “Talk.”\n\n \n\n You look at Liz. There’s no audience here. No one to see what you’re doing. It’s now time to decide what to do.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n You reach deep down inside you for your reserves of magical energy. “Fall asleep,” you say, “and let your memories drift as you slumber.”\n\n \n\n “No!” Liz mutters as you utter the words. It’s too late. You watch as she slumps over on the sofa, out cold.\n\n \n\n Silence fills the air. You move over quietly to the sofa, checking her pulse. As expected, she is just in a deep-sleep.\n\n \n\n Confidence you got the spell right, you shake her to bring her around. Her eyes flicker after some gentle nudges. \n\n \n\n \n ”Emily?” Liz sleepily says. You smile reassuringly and nod. She looks around. “Where am I?”\n\n \n\n “You’re at my house,” you tell her. “You came over to study, but it looks like you overdid it. I just came back from the toilet to find you passed out.”\n\n \n\n You help Liz to sit upright, as her eyes scan the living room. “I don’t remember,” she mutters. “What were we studying?”\n\n \n\n “Maths,” you tell her. “I thought I could help, as you keep zoning out in maths. You don’t know why that is, do you?”\n\n \n\n Liz looks at you, still half-dazed. She shakes her head. \n\n \n\n You smile. “I think you should go home,” you say. “Might want to call it tonight.”\n\n \n\n She nods, getting to her feet. “Yeah. That sounds good,” she mutters. “Goodnight Em.”\n\n \n\n You watch as Liz walks over and leaves through the front door. Mission complete.\n\n \n ”?” Liz sleepily says. You smile reassuringly and nod. She looks around. “Where am I?”\n\n \n\n “You’re at my house,” you tell her. “You came over to study with Emily, but it looks like you overdid it. She said you were studying and you just passed out.”\n\n \n\n You help Liz to sit upright, as her eyes scan the living room. “I don’t remember,” she mutters. “Where is she?”\n\n \n\n \"She even rushed out,\" you tell her. \"To see if any of our neighbours have smelling salts. Doesn't look like we need them after all, thankfully.\"\n\n \n\n Liz looks at you, still half-dazed. She shakes her head. \n\n \n\n You smile. “I think you should go home,” you say. “Might want to call it tonight.”\n\n \n\n She nods, getting to her feet. “Yeah. That sounds good,” she mutters. “Goodnight .”\n\n \n\n You watch as Liz walks over and leaves through the front door. Mission complete.\n\n \n She eyes you carefully as she comes back around, a look of utter confusion spread across her face.\n\n \n\n “It’s alright,” you tell her. “You’re safe. You’re at the Phillips’ house. Emily phoned me in a panic. She said you were studying and you just passed out.”\n\n \n\n Liz gives you a baffled look, then scans the living room. “The Phillips’ house?” she repeats, her words sounding like she’s still in a dream.\n\n \n\n You nod. “Emily was in a real state. She even rushed out to see if any of her neighbours had smelling salts. Doesn’t look like we need them after all, thankfully.”\n\n \n\n You help Liz to sit upright. “I don’t remember,” she mutters. “I don’t remember anything.”\n\n \n\n “Emily mentioned you’ve been zoning out in Maths too. You don’t know why that is, do you?”\n\n \n\n Liz looks at you, still half-dazed. She shakes her head. \n\n \n\n You smile. “I think you should go home,” you say. “Might want to call it tonight.”\n\n \n\n She nods, getting to her feet. “Yeah. That sounds good,” she mutters. “You’ll tell Emily I’m okay?”\n\n \n\n You nod. Liz walks over and leaves through the front door. Mission complete.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n \n “I’ve found out some things,” you begin. “It’s the cheerleaders, Liz. They are the ones causing the trouble at Charlton school.”\n\n \n\n Liz shoots you a sceptical look. “You’re telling me the likes of Britney Hudson are capable of casting magic? Come on.”\n\n \n\n “There’s a coven,” you explain. “Britney, Stacey, Reagan, Christina. And, if we can keep up the charade, now Emily.”\n\n \n\n “You’ve joined their coven?” Liz asks, bristling.\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “No. But I am pretending to. I’m close, Liz. Close to finding out exactly what they are doing. I think I can stop them.”\n\n \n\n “Do you even know what a coven is?” Liz asks, with a twinge of venom. “You come together. As one. If you don’t join in, it’s obvious.”\n\n \n\n “I can handle it,” you tell her. “But I’m going to need your help.”\n\n \n\n Liz looks at you, eyes burrowed. “How?”\n\n \n\n “Christina set me one final test. She wanted me to cast a spell on you to make you forget everything you knew about magic. Even that it existed.”\n\n \n\n The words make Liz flinch in her seat. “She knows?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “I’m not going to do it, obviously. But she has to think that I’ve done it. So I can get closer to them.”\n\n \n\n Liz looks to the floor, thinking. After a moment, she looks up at you, all traces of her usual enthusiasm gone. “So you’re asking me to stop looking into magic?”\n\n \n\n Smiling sadly, you nod. “For the time being. At least until we stop them.”\n\n \n\n Liz scuffs one of her boots with the other, mulling over your request. “Okay,” she mutters. “I’ll pretend I’ve forgotten. Everything.”\n\n \n\n After a moment of silence, Liz stands to her feet. Wordlessly, she walks towards the front door. \n\n \n\n She looks back at you as she opens it, thinking. “One thing. Did you ever consider, even for a moment, actually making me forget?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. She nods, smiling appreciatively back at you. “Thank you.”\n\n \n\n With that, Liz walks out and shuts the door. Mission accomplished. Of sorts.\n\n \n “First of all, I wanted to apologise,” you tell Liz. “I didn’t want to upset you. I just had to.”\n\n \n\n Liz snarls her nose up, clenching her jaw. “You had to?” \n\n \n\n “I’ve found out some things,” you say. “I had to get close to the cheerleaders, Liz. It’s them. They’re the ones behind all of it.”\n\n \n\n Liz shoots you a sceptical look. “You’re telling me the likes of Britney Hudson are capable of casting magic? Come on.”\n\n \n\n “There’s a coven,” you explain. “Britney, Stacey, Reagan, Christina. And, if we can keep up the charade, now Emily.”\n\n \n\n “You’ve joined their coven?” Liz asks, bristling.\n\n \n\n You shake your head. “No. But I am pretending to. I’m close, Liz. Close to finding out exactly what they are doing. I think I can stop them.”\n\n \n\n “Do you even know what a coven is?” Liz asks, with a twinge of venom. “You come together. As one. If you don’t join in, it’s obvious.”\n\n \n\n “I can handle it,” you tell her. “But I’m going to need your help.”\n\n \n\n Liz can’t help but laugh. “You want my help? This… you’re a real piece of work.”\n\n \n\n “I understand how you must feel,” you say, pleadingly. “But Christina set me one final test. She wants me to cast a spell to make you forget everything you knew about magic.”\n\n \n\n The words cause Liz’s eyes to glance at the door. She shifts in her seat, like she’s readying for a confrontation. \n\n \n\n “I’m not going to do it, obviously,” you blurt out. “But she has to think that I’ve done it.”\n\n \n\n Liz looks at you, her eyes burning with anger. “Are you seriously going to ask me to pretend I don’t know magic?”\n\n \n\n “Come on, Liz,” you beg. “Just stop practising for a while. Until I can stop Christina.”\n\n \n\n Liz rolls her nose, burying her top teeth down into her bottom lip. Her pale face is red with anger. \n\n \n\n “Fuck,” she barks. “This is bullshit.”\n\n \n\n After a moment of silence, you break the tension. “So you’ll do it?”\n\n \n\n Liz stares back at you, but nods. You take a sigh of relief.\n\n \n\n She stands to her feet and walks towards the door. She looks back at you for a moment as she holds the handle. “Why didn’t you just cast the spell on me?”\n\n \n\n “I didn’t want to,” you reply. \n\n \n\n She gives you a look, then nods. Her anger dissipates just a little. “Thank you.”\n\n \n\n With that, Liz walks out and shuts the door. Mission accomplished. Of sorts.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You approach Emily, not sure exactly how to begin.\n\n \n\n \"Hey, Em, can I ask a favor?\"\n\n \n\n She barely glances up from her phone, flicking her nails against the screen. \"Sure. What’s up?\"\n\n \n\n \"I was wondering… you seem to get a better reaction when you’re wearing makeup. Have you found that?\"\n\n \n\n She lets out a dry laugh, finally looking at you. \"You do live here, right? Of course I get a better reaction. This is Charlton.\"\n\n \n\n \"Right. Makes sense.\" You hesitate for a second, then go for it. \"So, uh… do you think I could use your vanity table? Just for touch-ups, I mean. And only when I'm you.\"\n\n \n\n That gets her attention. Her gaze sharpens, her phone lowering slightly. \"You need my makeup?\"\n\n \n\n You nod.\n\n \n\n She exhales, shaking her head. \"I know you own your own makeup. You’re telling me that’s not good enough now?\"\n\n \n\n \"That’s not what I -\"\n\n \n\n She clicks her tongue, already sighing. \"No, whatever, it’s fine. Just don’t make a habit of it. And don’t you dare ruin my brushes.\"\n\n \n\n You smile politely and turn away from your sister. At least you have permission to use her stuff when you're in your form. Her words about you having your own make-up dwell within your mind. She's not wrong. But...\n\n \n\n Since when did you start owning any make-up?\n\n \n\n You approach Emily, not sure exactly how to begin.\n\n \n\n \"Hey, Em, can I ask a favor?\"\n\n \n\n She looks up, brows raising slightly. \"Sure. What’s up?\"\n\n \n\n You shift your weight, suddenly aware of how awkward this is going to sound. \"I was wondering... you seem to get a better reaction when you’re wearing makeup. Have you found that?\"\n\n \n\n Emily snorts, rolling her eyes. \"Well, obviously. This is Charlton.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, half-expecting that response. \"Right. That’s what I figured.\" You hesitate, then push forward. \"So, uh… do you think I could use your vanity table? For when I’m you, I mean.\"\n\n \n\n Her eyes look back at yours for a moment as if she’s waiting for the punchline.\n\n \n\n When you don't deliver it, her faces melts. \"Oh my god.\" She slaps a hand over her face, groaning. \"Why do you keep making this worse?\"\n\n \n\n \"It’s not -\"\n\n \n\n \"It is!\" she cuts in, waving a hand in your general direction. \"First, you take my body, now you want to mess with my face? Do you even know what you’re doing? Makeup isn’t just stuff you slap on! It’s curated! It’s precision! There’s an art to it!\"\n\n \n\n You open your mouth, but she’s already on a roll.\n\n \n\n \"Do you even know what foundation shade I use? What brushes go with what? What brands are safe? No, you don’t! And I refuse to let you walk out of this house looking like some tragic, over-contoured clown just because you...\"\n\n \n\n She stops mid-rant, exhaling sharply. She takes in your expression. Realises this isn't something you're comfortable with too.\n\n \n\n Then, after a moment, she shakes her head. \"You know what? Fine. Fine. Just - don’t break anything, don’t touch my best stuff unless it’s a literal emergency, and if you use up my mascara, I will end you.\"\n\n \n\n You smile politely and turn away from your sister, feeling the unease about using her makeup only increasing now it's only a step from reality.\n\n**Actions**\n\n<>",

Not really.”\n\n \n\n Emily frowns, setting her book aside. “Not really?”\n\n \n\n You exhale, rubbing the back of your neck. “Let’s just say Dennis figured out pretty fast that I wasn’t actually into it. It got awkward. And then worse.”\n\n \n\n Emily winces. “Oof. Poor guy.”\n\n \n\n You nod. “Yeah, it wasn’t great. He shut down completely, and when we left, he basically bolted. No key.”\n\n \n\n Emily sighs, rubbing her temples. “So much for that plan.” She looks at you carefully, her lips pressing together in thought.\n\n \n\n “Well,” she says after a beat, “at least you tried. And at least you didn’t lead him on.”\n\n \n\n She shifts slightly, her eyes flicking toward you, hesitant. “Did… you feel weird about any of it?”\n\n \n\n You pause, considering. “Not in the way you’re thinking.”\n\n \n\n Emily doesn’t push further, but her expression stays conflicted. She looks like she's deciding whether to say something.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You exhale, dropping onto the couch across from Emily. “It actually wasn’t terrible.”\n\n \n\n Emily raises an eyebrow. “Really?”\n\n \n\n You nod. “I mean, yeah, it was weird at first. He was nervous. I was nervous. But once we started talking, it… I don’t know. It felt normal.”\n\n \n\n Emily leans forward slightly, eyes narrowing in curiosity. “Normal?”\n\n \n\n You hesitate, then shrug. “He was just… nice. He talked about stuff he liked. I talked about stuff I liked. I think he was happy.”\n\n \n\n Emily watches you, her gaze searching, like she’s waiting for you to add something.\n\n \n\n “And?” she prompts.\n\n \n\n “And that’s it,” you say, voice firm. “I made him feel like it was real enough that he gave me the key. That’s what we needed, right?”\n\n \n\n Emily nods slowly, but there’s a thoughtful look in her eyes, one she doesn’t fully voice. She looks like she's deciding whether to say something.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You hesitate, suddenly feeling aware of every small detail - the way your lips still tingle, the way Dennis’ eyes lingered on you, the way you didn’t pull away.\n\n \n\n Emily notices immediately. She narrows her eyes. “Okay, now I need details.”\n\n \n\n You sit down carefully, choosing your words. “It went… really well.”\n\n \n\n Emily’s frown deepens. “You mean, like… normal well? Or Charlton well?”\n\n \n\n You rub your temples. “We talked, we ate, he gave me the key.”\n\n \n\n Emily tilts her head. “And?”\n\n \n\n \n \n You clear your throat. “And… he might have kissed me.”\n\n \n\n Silence.\n\n \n\n Absolute silence.\n\n \n\n Emily stares at you, her face frozen, mouth slightly open, like she can’t process what she just heard. “Wait.” She holds up a hand, eyes wide with horror. “He kissed you?” She physically recoils, shaking her head like she’s trying to erase the thought from existence.\n\n \n\n “You mean - he kissed *me*. But it was you...” She makes a strangled noise. “Oh my God.”\n\n \n\n You hold up your hands. “It wasn’t. Look, I just, he leaned in, and I -”\n\n \n\n “Did you kiss him back?!” she practically shrieks.\n\n \n\n You look away.\n\n \n\n Emily groans loudly, throwing herself backward onto the couch. “This is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me.”\n\n \n\n You roll your eyes, but your stomach twists at the memory. “Emily, it got us the key.”\n\n \n\n She groans louder, covering her face. “Yeah, but at what cost?!”\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, clearly distressed, then peeks at you through her fingers.\n\n \n\n “Did you like it?” she asks, like she can’t believe she’s even saying the words.\n\n \n\n You open your mouth. Close it. You say nothing.\n\n \n\n Emily lets out a soft gasp. “You did.”\n\n \n\n “I -”\n\n \n\n “You liked it.”\n\n \n\n “Emily, can we focus?”\n\n \n\n Emily groans again, sitting up and rubbing her temples. “No. We are never speaking of this again.”\n\n \n\n You are happy with that, at least.

Because this whole thing is abnormal, Emily.”\n\n \n\n She looks at you, considering her response. “You mean… you might have to do that again?”\n\n \n\n You shrug. “If it helps.”\n\n \n\n “I don’t want to know,” she says, shaking her head. \"If you're going to keep on doing this, just keep me out of it.

You can use my wardrobe.”\n\n \n\n You stare at her. \"Why would I want to do that?\"\n\n \n\n She raises an eyebrow. \"Why would you want to go on a date with a boy? You're doing a lot I didn't expect from you. It's just going to be easier for me if I don't know.\"\n\n \n\n She sighs, looking away like she’s already regretting it. “Everything will fit you, anyway.”\n\n \n\n You pause, absorbing her words. You don’t want to do this again. Do you?\n\n \n\n Emily sighs, returning to her book. Leaving you to digest her offer.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>",

But we need that key. It's the only way we'll stop what's happening.\"\n\n \n\n Emily crosses her arms tightly, shaking her head. \"I can't believe you're seriously asking me to do this.

A fresh set of plain clothes on her. She looks ready to leave.\n\n \n You approach cautiously, giving Emily a reassuring look. \"I know Dennis isn't great, but just think of it like playing a part. One quick date and we're closer to getting the answers we need.\"\n\n \n\n Emily scoffs openly, rolling her eyes. \"Oh, wonderful. So now I'm supposed to play nice with Dennis just because you need information? This isn't exactly my idea of an ideal date.\"\n\n \n\n \"It won't take long,\" you promise carefully. \"And then you'll never have to deal with him again.\"\n\n \n\n Emily eyes you carefully, arms folded, voice dripping with irritation. \"This is so beneath me, . Seriously. Dennis is repulsive.\"\n\n \n\n She sighs dramatically, shaking her head in frustration. \"Fine, if it gets you your precious information, I'll do it. But if anyone from school sees us, you’re going to hear about it.\"\n\n \n\n You nod, acknowledging her irritation. \"Thank you, Em.

It’s a translation of the text from shards of tablets found in the moors near the village of Sevrene. They were uncovered by a bomb defusal team after the Second World War.

A sharp, crashing thump. Your eyes snap open. Your throat is parched. Your heart is pounding. You feel displaced. And your eyes flick around the room to see what disturbed you.\n\n \n\n Across the room, frozen in the doorway, stands Emily. Hand still on the door knob, eyes wide, lips parted as if in mid-sentence. Then, at the foot of your bed, you notice a figure looming.\n\n \n\n The dazzling blue eyes of Annie Clancy look down at you, her mouth wide open.\n\n \n\n She stares down at you, speechless. Not at you. At themselves. Their own face beneath the sheet. Your face.\n\n \n\n You remember, too late, the rule. To walk another’s dream, you must become them. Now they stand before themselves in your bed. Your mind can’t comprehend what’s going through their mind.\n\n \n\n The silence stretches unbearably. Emily remains statue-still. Annie goes to take a step forward --\n\n \n\n You feel the heat rise in your chest. Your fingers twitch. You know one spell that might help.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Amber light flares in your palms, shimmering with power, and you fling it toward Annie. It strikes her chest…\n\n \n\n And fizzles.\n\n \n\n The magic crawls down their body like it’s been rerouted. Draining harmlessly into the floor. Protected. By instinct. Or enchantment. Or something older.\n\n \n\n Annie staggers back, eyes wide in alarm, hand clutching at her chest. “What… what was that?” she gasps.\n\n \n\n Her breathing quickens. “Magic?” she whispers, disbelief lacing her voice. “You did magic?”\n\n \n\n Another step back, panic blazing in her eyes as they flick to Emily, still frozen in the doorway. Then back to you. Tears glisten at the corners of her eyes. “What’s happening?”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n\n You shoot up in bed, instinctively pulling the sheets up with you over your breasts. Annie’s breasts. Her breasts.\n\n \n\n She’s still staring at you, wide-eyed and trembling. Staring at your face. Her face. Her doppelganger. Almost a scene from a nightmare. She stumbles back, breath catching in her throat. “Who… who are you?”\n\n \n\n Your mouth opens, sound lodged somewhere behind your teeth. Finally you manage, in a voice that is unmistakably hers. “Annie, it’s me.”\n\n \n\n Annie’s brow furrows in confusion, voice shaking. “Me? What do you mean, me?”\n\n \n\n “It’s me,” you repeat. “.”\n\n \n\n “No,” she replies. “You’re not… you’re not…” \n\n \n\n But she struggles to finish her sentence. As much as this is cracking her sanity, you can see in her eyes she doesn’t know what to say.\n\n \n\n “I’m ”, you repeat. “Only I look like you. Like you said. It’s magic.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes go wide, suspicion and dread rippling across her features. She looks down at her chest, then to the floor, seeing the residual embers of your spell flickering on the carpet. When she looks up, there’s something resembling Annie looking back at you. “Prove it.”\n\n \n\n You reach back into your memories of you and Annie. Right back to something no one else would know. “Remember when I first started at the repair shop,” you begin. “My first day. When I first walked in, with a coffee from Fresh Pot. I went to shake your hand, stumbled, and spilt coffee all over your white blouse.”\n\n \n\n You watch as her eyes widen. A memory that she still has bubbling up. “You could see that I wasn’t wearing a bra underneath,” she says quietly.\n\n \n\n “Did you ever tell anyone about that?” you ask. “And didn’t I promise you I would do the same.”\n\n \n\n Annie’s eyes drift to the floor, lost deep in thought. From the door, a quiet cough breaks the silence. You look up to see Emily standing there, awkwardly. \n\n \n\n “It’s okay,” you tell her. “Can you give us a minute?” \n\n \n\n She looks back to Annie, then to you. Nods. She slips away wordlessly, the door clicking shut behind her.\n\n \n\n Annie drops down with a gentle thud on the end of your bed, staring off without focus. Finally, she looks back at you. “? But how?”\n\n \n\n You offer her a sympathetic smile. “This is going to sound wild, Annie. But I’ve got some things to share with you. About magic.”\n\n \n\n She looks at you, her skepticism replaced with bafflement. Amongst the fear. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You take a deep breath, recalling how not-so-long-ago this was explained to you in a way that didn’t seem crazy. “So there’s a power. Hidden usually. It’s deeply entwined with all things. And certain people have some sort of affinity for using it.”\n\n \n\n “Like Harry Potter?” Annie asks.\n\n \n\n You give her a grin. “Not quite. But kind of. They can cast spells. Create charms. Change things using their powers. Honestly, I’m new to this. It’s usually reserved for women, but…” You reach over and pick up the amulet from your bedside table. “This is something I can use. To change. Pretend to be someone else.”\n\n \n\n Annie looks at the amulet in your hand for a moment, then her eyes flick back to you. “You’ve been pretending to be me?”\n\n \n\n You catch your breath as you're reminded once more of your current form. Of Annie. And now she’s staring right back at you.\n\n \n\n “I had a good reason,” you say flatly, Annie’s usual chirpy inflection missing from the voice that emerges from your mouth. “Something’s wrong at the school. Among other things, I think something bad is going to happen to one of the students.” You take a deep breath. “Something that I think happened to you.”\n\n \n\n She looks at you, her eyes appraising your face and the outline of the body underneath the covers. “You’ve been pretending to be me,” she states again. “Why?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Something happened to you at school,” you begin. “Something between you and the cheerleaders. Something to do with Penny. And Jennifer. I used a spell to find out what that was.”\n\n \n\n She stares back, an incredulous look on her face. She’s lost for words.\n\n \n\n You press on. “You reclaimed some memory this morning. What did you see?”\n\n \n\n \n Annie’s stomach clenches; she presses a trembling hand to her temple. “I… flashes,” she murmurs. “A dream that felt more real than life. Almost memories from another person.” She glances up at you. “But also. They were real. It all happened.”\n\n \n\n She shakes her head, as if trying to understand. Her green eyes fill with fear. “Why would you do this?”\n\n \n\n You reach for her hand. “There’s something planned for a boy at school. Terrence. I had to see what they intended for him, to stop it. I think it’s what happened to you.”\n\n \n\n Annie’s breath hitches. “No,” she whispers. She pauses, looking away. “I…” \n\n \n\n After a long pause she turns back to face you, face almost calm. “Ask me what you need to know.”\n\n \n Annie shakes her head. “Nothing. Nothing worth talking about. I don’t want to reopen old wounds. Please. Can’t we just leave it be?” \n\n \n\n “It’s important, Annie,” you reply. “Trust me, I wouldn’t have done this if it wasn’t.”\n\n \n\n She once again looks you up and down. Again shaking her head. “This feels like a dream.”\n\n \n\n “I know it’s a lot,” you say. “But you might know something that could help someone. Isn’t that enough?”\n\n \n\n Her shoulders slump. “Ask me what you need to know,” she murmurs.\n\n \n \n\n Actions\n\n <>\n \n Annie sits at the end of your bed, looking to you almost vacant. Her legs are curled around on the edge of the bed, facing away from you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>",

The door clicks shut behind her. Silence spreads through the room like it was a living thing.\n\n \n\n Jennifer exhales, the sound sharp and controlled. She turns away, then pivots, letting her eyes roam over you as if cataloguing every detail of your appearance. How you lie, where your breath catches, how your fingers grip the sheet. She raises a single brow. “How long has this been going on?”\n\n \n\n You hope to heaven that the ground swallows you up. The question hangs in the air like a challenge.\n\n \n\n “What have you been doing as me?”\n\n \n\n She begins to pace, her footsteps soft on your bedroom floor. “Did you go to work as me? Walk the streets where I live? Speak to people I know?” She stops and looks at you, her green eyes hardened. “Did you… like it?”\n \n \n \nYou hold the sheets up, paralysed with the fear of Jennifer asking you to stand. You are conscious that beneath the sheets, you are naked. But she continues to pace, only occasionally throwing glances at you.\n\n \n\n \"It makes so much sense now,\" she continues. Gordon saying I was flirting with him? Being drunk in McTafeys? Helping Maisie’s Aunt. My mysterious facial treatment. Christina’s tale to her dad. Terry Evans dinner invite. Kissing Martin! Even that stuff about Martin and his van! She looks back at you, realisation spread visibly across her face. \"That was you.\"\n \n \n \n\n You look up from over the covers of your bed, feeling the naked skin of your body touching the fabric. Struggling yourself to comprehend the stark reality of looking up at your , but just seeing a reflection of you.\n\n \n\n “Jennifer, I --” you begin, but stop as soon as you hear yourself. She freezes, eyes widening at the sound of your voice. Her voice, don’t you mean?\n\n \n\n Silence festers, as Jen stares down at the bed, her face looking like it’s about to crack.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Silence hangs in the air. Jennifer remains fixated on you. Her shimmering green eyes meeting your own perfectly identical pair.\n\n \n\n <= 4>>\n \n Eventually her look drifts from you, wandering down towards the floor without focus. You see her mouth flinch, her eyes flicker. Her brain is racing. Like wave upon wave of realisation is striking her each second.\n\n \n\n “You liked it… didn’t you?” she whispers, finally returning to lock looks with you. “You like being me.”\n\n \n\n “Jennifer,” you say quietly, still conscious of the sounds of your words. “Please.”\n\n \n\n But she’s not listening. She slowly walks towards the mirror hanging on the wall. Stares at her own reflection. Then her eyes flicker to you in the mirror. Herself. Lying in your bed.\n\n \n\n “Maybe you should just be me,” she whispers, still looking at you through the reflection. “Go to the Department Store everyday. Smile politely. Keep your head down. Cook when you get home.”\n \n \n “I can’t believe you would do this,” she whispers slowly. “After everything. I’d never thought I’d feel so lost again. Especially not because of you.”\n\n \n\n “Jennifer,” you say quietly, still conscious of the sounds of your words. “Please.”\n\n \n\n But she’s not listening. She slowly walks towards the mirror hanging on the wall. Stares at her own reflection. Then her eyes flicker to you in the mirror. Herself. Lying in your bed.\n\n \n \n\n Finally, Jennifer turns. Relative to the situation, she manages to resemble being composed. \n\n \n\n “The obvious question is why, of course,” she says flatly. “What possible reason you had for doing something…” her eyes flicker up and down your form underneath the sheets. “Like this.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “I needed to know what happened,” you say, still wincing at the sound of Jennifer's voice coming from you. “Between you and Annie. Back at school. Neither of you would speak about it!”\n\n \n\n \n Realisation again flashes across Jennifer’s face. “This morning,” she murmurs. “When I woke up. My mind was full of memories.” She looks back at you, her expression hardening. “Things I fought so hard to bury. They all came bubbling up. You did that, didn’t you?”\n \n \n “And did you find what you were looking for?” she asks.\n\n \n\n “Some of it,” you say with a little hesitancy. “But not everything.”\n\n \n\n At that, Jennifer actually sighs. She closes her eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. When they open she seems calmer. At least a little.\n\n \n\n “It was a painful time for me, ,” she tells you. “Why won’t you just leave it alone? Is it really worth going through this?”\n\n \n\n Again, her eyes seem to gesture to your body. You flinch, feeling even more self-conscious.\n \n \n\n “I had to,” you say, feeling frustration in your own voice. “You know something’s happening to Terrence. That it’s just like what happened before.”\n\n \n\n Your volume raises as it becomes harder. “I tried, Jen! Really I did. But you wouldn't say! So I used magic to try and get to the truth myself! Christ, do you hear how insane this all sounds. How crazy it is!”\n\n \n\n Silence returns. But for once, Jennifer’s rage appears to fizzle. Her eyes still rest darkly on you, but there’s a measured sense of control behind them now.\n\n \n\n “Ask your questions, then” she tells you. “And then we’ll figure out what to do.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You shift in the bed. She still stands, slightly awkwardly in the centre of your room. Staring right back at you. Waiting.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n \n <>",

    "text": "You step closer as the girl’s silhouette resolves in the shallow glow of the streetlamp. Her voice drifts like velvet. “Siobhan,” she murmurs. Her eyes stare back at you. Too bright and too clear, as if they see straight through you. “You’re lookin’ for summat. Strugglin’ to get the truth out of them, are ya? You’d pay a good amount of coin for the truth, I bet.”\n\n \n\n You clear your throat. “Excuse me?”\n\n \n\n She tilts her head, letting the silence stretch thin. Finally, she answers. “Those girls at school. They got up to summat, didn't they? And that poor boy Terrence… he’s got something comin’ to him if nobody finds out what went down back then.”\n\n \n\n Your pulse hammers. “How do you know about Terrence?”\n\n \n\n She brushes a stray lock of hair aside. “Names matter less than what they hide.” Her gaze flicks away for a heartbeat, then back. \"Old sins circle back, you’ll see.\"\n\n \n\n The girl looks back at you, eyes sparkling. \"Too cryptic for you? Or do you like your riddles served blunt?”\n\n \n You step forward as Siobhan’s coy smile fades into that familiar, knowing expression.\n\n \n\n \n “Talked to both of ’em, have ya? Neither gave you what you came for. Ye want to know what happened? Understand Jennifer? Or help Annie remember? Annie can’t recall, and Jennifer won’t confess. But ye needn’t beg ’em. Ye can see it yerself… and set their memories free. Choose: the careful one or the broken one.”\n\n \n\n With a graceful flick, she produces a small tin from her clothes and snaps it open. Inside, two delicate leaf cuttings pulse with a faint, otherworldly light. One is brittle and splintered, its edges jagged as though fractured; the other a perfect maple leaf, its veins glowing like living runes.\n\n \n\n “Only one,” she whispers, voice soft as moth wings. “Ye have to decide.”\n\n \n “Talked to the blonde one, have ya? Ye want to know what happened? Help Annie remember? Ye needn’t beg her. Ye can see it yerself… and set her memories free.”\n\n \n\n She flicks her wrist, and the tin appears in her palm. With a careful snap, it opens to reveal a single leaf cutting, its brittle, jagged form pulsing with faint, otherworldly light.\n\n \n\n “Or,” she adds, voice soft but insistent, “you can try talking to the brunette - Jennifer. See if she’ll shed any light herself. And if she won’t… I can help you there too. But you’ll have to choose: the broken one or the careful one. Only one. Ye have to decide.”\n\n \n “Talked to the brunette, have ya? Ye want to know what happened? Help Jennifer confess? Ye needn’t beg her. Ye can see it yerself… and set her memories free.”\n\n \n\n With a practiced gesture, she reveals the tin and snaps it open. Inside lies a single, perfect maple leaf cutting, its veins glowing like living runes against the night.\n\n \n\n “Or,” she murmurs, “you can seek out the blonde - Annie. See if her memories might surface. And if she stays silent… I can help you there too. But you’ll have to choose: the careful one or the broken one. And only one. Ye have to decide.”\n \n \n \n\n You meet her gaze, heart still thudding, as Siobhan inclines her head and stays silent. Her bright eyes gleam in the streetlamp’s glow, patient and expectant, waiting for your next question.\n\n**Actions**\n\n<>\n\n<>\n\n<>\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Emily's Room**\n\n [image: ./images/Emilys_Room.png]\n\n \n \n Entering Emily’s room is enough to make you feel even more alien in your body. You are standing in an eighteen year old girl’s bedroom, surrounded by posters of female popstars, plush cushions and a table full of make-up. Yet this is where you are about to get changed. Into the clothes you'll be wearing out for the day.\n\n \n\n You take a deep breath and open up her wardrobe, looking for her school uniform.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You pull back the wardrobe door and are struck by the array of fabrics and styles Emily has collected. You always remembered her being plain and a tomboy, but some of these newer clothes are stylish, bold and dare you think it, sexy.\n\n \n\n Pushing them aside, you look down the rack and find Emily's spare uniform. It sits on some hangers together.\n\n \n\n You take it out and throw it on the bed. A white blouse. Pleated short skirt. A school tie. This would have seemed archaic when you were at school. You can't believe that Emily has to wear this.\n\n \n\n *That you have to wear this.*\n\n \n\n Bracing yourself for the next part, you reach down and open Emily's underwear drawer. You are relieved that the great majority is what you've seen in the laundry. Scrappy sports briefs and everyday panties. You try to avoid touching the more lacy ones, which there are definitely more than you were expecting or are comfortable with.\n\n \n\n You pull out some white cotton panties and a white bra, thinking about how Jennifer dresses in lighter blouses. You also take out a pair of uniform socks. Thigh high and gray, matching the uniform. \n\n \n\n Finally, you look to Emily's shoe rack inside the wardrobe. You grimace. Her school shoes wouldn't satisfy a stripper, but the two inch heel is still more than you've had to walk in before.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You pull down the panties you are currently wearing and pull up the new ones. Then, making sure you've completely turned your back on the mirror, pull your sundress off.\n\n \n\n You stare down for a moment, looking at the breasts. On your chest. You thought you'd be sickened by seeing the boobs that belong to your sister, but as you notice them rise and fall with your breathing, you can't see them as anyone else's but yours.\n\n \n\n You reach out and grab the white bra, clipping it behind your back and adjusting your breasts to feel comfortable. Then you continue to get changed, putting on your blouse, your skirt, tie, and finally pulling up your socks over your legs so only a tiny bit of skin can be seen between the hem of your skirt and the top of your socks.\n\n \n\n Only now turning, you stare at yourself in the mirror. You see your sister staring back at you, yes. But you are also aware that it's you standing in front of the mirror. \n\n \n\n In a girl's body, wearing a skirt and thigh high socks and a school uniform. \n\n \n\n *How do you feel?*\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n You have no other words for it. You are horrified. Only this morning, you were a twenty-five year old man whose only body issues were you might be a little too skinny. Now you stare at yourself in the mirror, and you can only see an eighteen year old school girl.\n\n \n\n You quickly look away, grab the school shoes and buckle them up, then march out the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n The feeling is not exactly what you're used to, but you recognise it all the same. You feel flushed. There is a tingling from your new vagina. Looking in the mirror at yourself, you are feeling aroused.\n\n \n\n *You're curious, aren't you?*\n\n \n\n You quickly look away, grab the school shoes and buckle them up, then march out the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

You assume the big chains haven’t moved into Charlton as there's just no money to be made here.\n\n \n\n As you step in you see Ron, the sweaty middle-aged owner, cursing and muttering as he works the grill out the back. More pleasant is the warm smile from the young woman behind the counter, who you’ve struck up a rapport with since moving here. “Morning !” she says warmly. “Your usual? Be with you in a minute.”\n\n \n\n “Thanks Flo,” you reply. You stand at the counter and watch her prepare a coffee for the only other customer, Martin, who sits at a table off to the side.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You only know Martin after your brother Brock struck up a friendship with him over the summer before he went to University. Martin is a hulk of a man, scowling and snarling in equal measure. You know Brock used to drink with him in McTafeys, the local bar in the town. From the state of Brock the next morning, you know that Martin really likes to drink.\n\n \n\n “Hey nerd,” Martin greets you. “How’s your sister?”\n\n \n\n You remember that you bumped into him with Brock and Emily when you were all out shopping. Ever since then Martin has shown a creepy interest in Emily. \n\n \n\n “All good, Martin,” you say, noncommittally. \n\n \n\n “You’ll have to bring her out to McTafey’s one night,” he says, smirking. ”If she’s anything like her brother, she knows how to party.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You stand back, waiting idly for Flo to finish serving Martin. With a fresh coffee, she walks around the counter towards him, placing it down on the table. As she does so, his hand slips around her waist. She gasps as he pulls her closer to him.\n\n \n\n “Thanks darl,” he says. “Why don’t you sit down and join me?” You watch as his hand brushes her arse.\n\n \n\n “I need to get back to serve his coffee,\" she stammers, clearly not comfortable with his advances. You glance through to the kitchen, but Ron is either unaware or disinterested. He just continues to work the grill.\n\n \n\n “He can wait,” you hear Martin reply. “Why don’t you show me some attention?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Hey, leave her alone!” you say, stepping forward. Martin’s head spins around to look at you. He scowls and lets go of Flo. She leaps a step back, out of harm’s reach and away from the new conflict.\n\n \n\n Martin stands and steps up towards you. “What’s it to you, nerd?” he spits, staring you up and down. You don’t move, neither towards nor back from him.\n\n \n\n “You better watch yourself,” Martin barks, right in your face. “Just because I’m drinking pals with your brother doesn’t mean that I won’t beat the shit out of you.”\n\n \n\n You remain silent, staring back at him. You notice Flo looking between the pair of you. Her eyes are wide and lip quivers.\n\n \n\n “Fuck this,” he snorts, finally breaking the silence. “I’ve got deliveries to make anyway.” He steps forward and shoulder barges past you, nearly knocking you off your feet. “I’ll see you later, Flo.”\n\n \n\n The sound of the bell ringing is the only indicator Martin has left. Flo looks at you and smiles weakly. “Thanks for that, .”\n\n \n\n She goes back around the counter and makes your coffee, a tense silence hanging in the air. “On the house,” she whispers, placing the take-away cup on the counter. “Thank you, again.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You watch in silence, unable or unwilling to intervene. Martin pulls at Flo again, forcing her on to his lap. His muscular arms wrap around her waist and his hands reach down to caress her exposed thighs. “That’s a good girl,” you hear him mutter.\n\n Flo looks over to you, eyes pleading. Martin follows her stare, then meets your own gaze. “This is how real men treat their women,” he tells you. “Maybe one day you’ll learn that.”\n\n \n\n The waitress tries to get out of his grasp, but he only pulls her tighter. You watch as his hand moves over her pale skin, her waitress skirt riding up and threatening to reveal her underwear.\n\n \n\n “What’s going on here?” you hear Ron bark, as he comes out of the kitchen. \n\n \n\n Martin releases Flo slightly, but still you see what Ron sees - his waitress sitting in the lap of one of his customers, legs exposed and looking flustered.\n\n \n\n “Cut that crap out in public,” Ron barks. “If you want to be a slut, Florence, then do it on your own time.”\n\n \n\n Only then does Martin relinquish the hold he has on her. She leaps up, smoothing out her skirt and looking between her boss and Martin. “Yes Mr. Denver,” she finally mutters to Ron, then runs out to the kitchen.\n\n \n\n “Women these days,” Martin says to Ron as he stands up. “Just can’t control themselves. I’ve got deliveries to make and all she can think about is sex.”\n\n \n\n He walks towards the door, smirking as he passes you. “Say hi to your sister from me,” he says, exiting the shop.\n\n \n\n There is a moment of silence between you and Ron once Martin has gone, then the cafe owner sighs and goes back to the kitchen. Looks like you’re going to work without a coffee.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

The bar runs down one wall, making space for dozens of old wooden tables to be spread across the floor.\n\n \n\n Lennox gestures to one and puts the menus down on the table. “Our staff will be with you shortly,” he says, then walks off.\n\n \n\n You take a seat opposite Annie, who takes off her coat and crosses her legs as she looks at the menu. “I fancy a salad today,” she says. “I’m watching my weight. But choose anything you like. My shout.”\n\n \n\n Looking over the menu yourself, the steak leaps out at you. Some iron would really help kick your brain into gear. But you look to Annie, remembering she’s buying and that a salad would be more cost effective.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “The steak looks great,” you say. “Don’t worry, I’ll get up and order.”\n\n \n\n You stand up and she smiles gratefully.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I’m good with the salad too,” you reply. “Let me at least order.\"\n\n \n\n You stand up and she smiles gratefully.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You go to the bar and stand waiting. You can hear some noise from the kitchen, but there doesn’t seem to be anyone here that could serve you.\n\n \n\n There’s a bell on the counter. After waiting a minute, you hit it. It dings out, then silence returns.\n\n \n\n You wait another minute. Then two. Still no one has come out to serve you. You glance back to Annie. She smiles back at you, but offers no solution.\n\n \n\n Again, you hit the bell. Another minute passes. You press it again.\n\n \n\n This time you hear a long list of expletives erupt from the kitchen. You can tell it’s in French, but you have no idea what they mean.\n\n \n\n You then hear the clip clopping of heels from the entrance corridor and turn to see the maid from earlier trying to run in some very high heels, looking flustered.\n\n \n\n “I’m so sorry,” she says, coming around the bar. She can be no more than twenty, petite and small-framed. She is struggling to move fast in those shoes. “What can I get for you?”\n\n \n\n The kitchen door suddenly slams open like an old western. A fat, bulbous man covered in grease stains strides out behind the counter, looking between you and the maid.\n\n \n\n “Mon dieu!\" he barks at you. \"Please tell me you have not been waiting long, no?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n “We’ve just arrived,” you lie, looking at the maid knowingly.\n\n \n\n The fat chef eyes you glaringly, then curses again in French. “That bell has been ringing for ages!” he says, turning his rage towards the maid. “You have cost us paying customers who must have left!”\n\n \n\n The maid looks sheepish, barely looking up at him. “I was cleaning the rooms,” she stammers.\n\n \n\n “Cleaning doesn’t make me orders!” he replies loudly. “You are a lazy girl!”\n\n \n\n “I didn’t see anyone else here,” you say to him. “Maybe some kids were fooling around.”\n\n \n\n He once again eyes you darkly, then dismisses you with a wave of his hand. “Serve these guests,” he tells the maid. “And bring me orders!”\n\n \n\n He strides back into the kitchen, slamming the doors as he goes.\n\n \n\n The maid looks at you from behind the counter, mouths ‘Thank you,’ and asks for your order.\n\n \n\n You tell her what you and Annie want and she diligently puts it through on the till. You notice her name badge, ‘Andrea.’ “Thanks Andrea”, you say as she hands you a receipt. “Good job.”\n\n \n\n She smiles again, a genuine smile this time. Then saunters away to give the order to the chef back in the kitchen.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “We’ve been waiting some time,” you tell him honestly.\n\n \n\n His face turns even redder. He looks directly at the maid, simmering. “You are a lazy girl, Andrea! Paying guests are waiting for my food and you are letting them wait. They are starving! What a useless, lazy girl!\"\n\n \n\n The maid looks sheepishly to the floor. “I was cleaning the rooms,” she says.\n\n \n\n “Cleaning doesn’t give me orders!” he replies loudly. “Get out of my sight, I will serve them myself!”\n\n \n\n She scuttles off and you listen to her heels clapping as she disappears into the hotel. You look over at the enraged chef behind the counter, who watches her go before turning his attention to you.\n\n \n\n “Silly English women, all the same!” he laments. “None of them want to work in this restaurant. They stay for a day. Stay for a week. Then quit! And this maid… Andrea… she comes to work here, she does nothing!\"\n\n \n\n He curses again in French and sighs loudly. “What did you want to eat?”\n\n \n\n You tell him the order and he pounds some keys on the till. He throws a receipt over the counter and then strides back to the kitchen, slamming the doors as he goes.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Taking a deep breath, you walk back over and sit down with Annie. She looks up when she sees you. “Everything okay?” she asks. You nod and she lets it go, not mentioning it any further.\n\n \n\n Annie soon relaxes you, mixing small talk with some general chat about the office. You learn that she’s been working for Mr. Thompson for about a year since graduating from Charlton Upper School. \n\n \n\n “How do you like working for Mr. Thompson?” you ask, gently probing about how she feels about your hot-tempered boss.\n\n \n\n She smiles, coyly. “Fishing for gossip, ? You might need to get me another drink before my lips get loose.”\n\n \n\n You pause and she takes the silence as an invitation to continue. “Mr. Thompson is okay. He’s a stern boss. You just need to know how to handle a stern man.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes sparkle as she looks directly at you. She smiles. “How is Jennifer, by the way? I went to school with her. Did she tell you that? She was always so… prudish.”\n\n \n\n You blush, thinking about your girlfriend and whether you should be discussing her with a woman who you barely know.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Jennifer’s just got standards,” you say, trying to defend your girlfriend without being aggressive. “She’s not prudish when you live up to them.”\n\n \n\n Annie laughs. “Well, I’m glad she has such a loyal man that’s matches her expectations,” she says. “There’s such slim pickings in Charlton that some of us can’t be so picky with our boyfriends.”\n\n \n\n The conversation moves on and you find yourself talking about more comfortable topics, such as your parents and where you grew up. Eventually your food comes. You get stuck into it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n “Jennifer is just a little shy until you get to know her,” you admit. “She’s not that experienced with guys.”\n\n \n\n Annie nods. “She always was a bit of a tease at school. Acting so innocent and demure, but never would let any guy near her panties. Is she like that still, ? A bit of a tease?”\n\n \n\n You lack of words for a response is thankfully interrupted as your food arrives, breaking the tension.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n\n You start to eat your salad. Annie picks at hers, despite it being tiny.\n\n \n\n You feel calmer as you eat the lettuce leaves and carrot sticks littered across the plate. You catch sight of a steak being carried through the restaurant by Andrea and for a moment regret your choice. But taking another mouthful of the salad you admit that even bland food can be appealing. It also won't hurt your waistline, you think.\n\n \n\n *When did you start considering your waistline?*\n\n \n\n As you eat, Annie expertly turns chat back to more mundane topics away from Jennifer. Even so, you can’t help but feel an underlying subtext beneath that innocent chat.\n\n \n\n Eventually you both finish your meals and drinks. Annie looks at you as she puts on her coat again. “This was lovely. Thanks , we should do this again sometime. Maybe after work. If Jennifer doesn’t mind?”\n\n \n\n You say nothing, avoiding a reply.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You carve off a healthy slab of steak and put it into your mouth, tasting the juices instantly. You are careful not to dribble in front of Annie.\n\n \n\n She watches you eat, picking at her salad. You note that even though it's tiny, she seems disinterested. You do have to admit, it looks a little bland.\n\n \n\n As you eat, Annie expertly turns chat back to more mundane topics away from Jennifer. Even so, you can’t help but feel an underlying subtext beneath that innocent chat.\n\n \n\n Eventually you both finish your meals and drinks. Annie looks at you as she puts on her coat again. “This was lovely. Thanks , we should do this again sometime. Maybe after work. If Jennifer doesn’t mind?”\n\n \n\n You say nothing, avoiding a reply.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "“Dan was a total jackass again today. He made some lewd comments about Annie. Just completely inappropriate for a workplace.”\n\n \n\n “Annie?” Jennifer asks, not looking back from her cooking. “Annie Clancy? What did you do?”\n\n \n\n \n “I didn’t want to cause a fuss,” you say, hearing the flatness in your response. “He’s well liked by the boss.”\n\n \n\n “I wish men wouldn’t talk like that at work,” you hear Jennifer say. “Even if it is Annie Clancy.”\n\n \n “I told him it wasn’t appropriate. He shut up quickly. Hopefully he’ll keep those thoughts to himself from now on.”\n\n \n\n “Good,” Jennifer says. “Comments like that are never appropriate. Even if they are about Annie Clancy.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I ran into my brother’s friend, Martin, at Fresh Pot,” you begin. “He was harassing that waitress, Flo. Getting real handsy with her.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer turns, her expression serious. “Oh god,” she says. “What did you do?”\n\n \n\n \n “I told him to leave her alone,” you reply. “I thought for a moment he was going to fight me, but guys like that are all talk. He left pretty quickly.”\n\n \n\n “That’s so chivalrous of you,” Jennifer says, smiling. “Some guys just think that girls are just pieces of meat. You don’t know how difficult it is to be in that situation. It’s nice that someone stood up for Flo.”\n\n \n\n You smile, renewed with a sense of confidence from choosing to do the right thing.\n\n \n “I didn’t want to cause a fuss,” you say, with a little sigh. “He’s a big guy and he was being pretty aggressive.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer turns to look at you, a little disappointment on her face. “I understand,” she says after a moment. “Some guys are just all muscle and no brains. I’m glad you didn’t get hurt. But poor Flo.”\n\n \n\n She turns back to the kitchen top. You can’t help but feel a bit emasculated, especially when Jennifer referred to some guys being all muscle.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “Clive and Gordon were being their usual selves this morning. Clive gave me stick about not doing a real man’s job. I told him that his work relied on me fixing all the problems that the booking system was causing.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer smiles at you, giggling. “They won’t be saying that in a few years, when you are making a ton of money and they have cracked skin and bad backs from all the labour. Plus, I find your intelligence attractive.”\n\n \n “Clive and Gordon were being their usual selves this morning, Clive gave me stick about not doing a real man’s job. I told him that I wasn’t built for manual labour, and Gordon said that I should come by his gym to lift some weights.”\n\n \n\n You notice Jennifer raises an eyebrow. “Well, it wouldn’t hurt to try and build up some muscle. Gordon looks pretty good and he's even a bit older than you. You'd look so manly with toned arms too.”\n\n \n\n She turns back to cooking. You glance down at your arms, wondering if she thinks you are too skinny.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “The chef at the Charlton Hotel really tore into one of the staff at lunch. She was rushed off her feet and they seem to be short-staffed, and he just shouted at her in front of the whole restaurant for not serving us quickly enough.”\n\n \n\n “That place is just the pits,” Jennifer replies. “And the uniforms they make the girls wear are disgusting.” She turns to look at you. “What happened?”\n\n \n\n \n “I told him he was misunderstood. He shut up quickly after that.”\n\n \n\n “Good,” Jennifer says, turning back to the food. “I hate that place.\"\n\n \n “Well, I told him the truth. That was running late,” you say. You see Jennifer wince as the words come out of your mouth. “I think she probably got in trouble.”\n\n \n\n “That place goes through staff so quickly,” she says, reflecting. “Maybe she’ll find another job that isn’t so sleazy.”\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “I had lunch with Annie, our secretary,” you say. You hear Jennifer scraping the dinner off the baking tray more sternly than before. “I didn’t know you went to school with her.”\n\n \n\n “I didn’t like school,” Jennifer says with her back to you. “She wasn’t exactly in my group of friends either. What did she want?”\n\n \n\n \n “She said you were a bit.. Prudish,” you begin, realising this conversation could go badly quickly. “But I stuck up for you. Put her in her place.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer turns, hands on her hips. You can see the blood rushing to her face. “Prudish? What a little bitch,” she mutters. \n\n \n\n You watch her for a moment, simmering. Then she takes a deep breath and exhales. She smiles at you. “Thank you for coming to my defence. She is such a piece of work.”\n\n \n\n You smile back and watch her return back to cooking. A sense of relief washes over you.\n\n \n “She said you were a bit.. Prudish,” you begin, realising this conversation could go badly quickly. “I said you were just shy until you got to know people.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer turns, hands on her hips. You can see the blood rushing to her face. “You said what?” she says angrily. “You agreed with her? Do I look prudish?” she says, dramatically gesturing to her skirt. \n\n \n\n She turns her back to you again, scraping the food. “I didn’t know that girls like Annie Clancy were your thing,\" she mutters under her breath.\n\n \n\n You begin to apologise, but she cuts you off mid sentence. “It’s fine,” she says.\n\n \n\n You stand in the living room, staring back at her. You know it isn’t.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \"To sum up, it's been okay,\" you comment. \"Different day, same problems with angry bosses and strange work colleagues, I would have liked my Sunday to myself, though. Emily's still struggling with school and I wish I could have helped her more today.\" You shrug, giving her a smile. \"I wish I led a more exciting life, but what can I tell you?\"\n\n \n\n Jennifer glances back and flashes you a smile. \"Oh does the city boy think that quiet life in Charlton isn't exciting enough for him?\" she jokes.\n\n \n\n You smile. \"Enough about me. How was your day?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Jennifer's Apartment**\n\n [image: ./images/Jennifers_Apartment.png]\n\n \n\n The flat is decorated in pastels and neutral colours, feeling warm and homely. This is only emphasised by the smell of home cooking drifting through Jennifer’s small home. You suspect she's been cooking all evening.\n\n \n\n Once you take your coat off and sit down on the sofa, you look into the kitchen at your girlfriend making the final touches to dinner. She wears the short skirt and crop top that she sent you a picture of. She looks over her shoulder as she prepares dinner, noticing you watching her. She grins. “How was work? I can't believe you had to work on a Sunday.”\n\n \n Jennifer continues to cook, turning back to you regularly to listen.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Thankfully my day was more uneventful,” she says to you. “The department store was pretty busy, and my boss kept making comments about how I needed to smile like a singer and dress to impress. He’s such an oddball.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer has told you so much about her boss, Terry Evans, the owner of the general store. Jennifer is convinced he’s strange. You offer her a sympathetic look as she continues.\n\n \n\n “His daughter was in today. I think she’s in Emily’s year. Head cheerleader. So spoilt. All he could do was give her anything she wanted in the store. Meanwhile, I’m having to serve all the customers and help manage the changing rooms at the same time.”\n\n \n\n She finishes putting the meal on two plates and brings them to the dining room table. “I can’t wait until Emily finishes school and we can get out of here,” she says as she serves dinner. “Just the two of us.”\n\n \n\n You smile again and sit down, tucking into the amazing meal Jennifer has cooked for you. You can’t help but stare at her breasts in-between bites, noticing how her new top pushes them up for you to see. She smiles a little as she catches your stares.\n\n \n\n “Emily is struggling a bit in Maths class,” you comment, trying to make conversation and quell your arousal. “Some girl even gave her an amulet and told her that it would help her pass her test.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer frowns at your reply. “What amulet?” she asks.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “An old one,” you continue. “With a green emerald. It came with a note that said that someone could help her when she needed it, if they thought about her hard enough. It was written on old paper, like it was really old.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks at you, cautiously. “I’d be careful with that, if I was you. That school is a strange place. It’s like it hasn’t moved on since the last century.”\n\n \n\n You nod. “I’m sure it’s nothing.” \n\n \n\n “Just be careful,” she says again. “Don’t do anything foolish.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Some hokey new age nonsense that girls are into these days,” you say. “You know teenage girls. There are affirmations and healing gems. The point is, it’s not going to help Emily. She just needs to knuckle down and get on with her studies.”\n\n \n\n You notice Jennifer’s eye twitch, but she nods politely. “Well, keep discouraging her about anything like that,” she says. “That school is a strange place. Just tell her to concentrate on her studies and get out of there.”\n\n \n\n You nod, noting Jennifer’s sudden serious tone. But you continue eating.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You eat the last bite of your meal and push the plate to the middle of the table. You look to Jennifer and notice that she has barely touched her dinner. “Not hungry?” you ask.\n\n \n\n She looks at you with a glint in her eye and stands up, walking around the table. “Oh I’m hungry. Just not for food.” She sits down in your lap and moves her leg over you, straddling you in her very short skirt.\n\n \n\n “How hungry are you?” she purrs before kissing you deeply, her soft lips touching yours.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n Jennifer grins, and grinds her hips against your groin as she looks into your eyes. \"What do you think of my silly little skirt?\" she asks.\n\n \n\n You look down, watching it ride up and expose her underwear. A lacy black thong. Glancing back up, you smile. \"I think it's great.\"\n\n \n\n \"I can tell,\" she says softly, as you feel your penis grow hard in your pants. \"It seems you like my panties too.\"\n\n \n\n You lean in to kiss Jennifer's neck and she arches her head back, welcoming your lips. You kiss her gently and tenderly, then reach with your hand under her skirt -\n\n \n\n An offensively loud phone ring erupts from the landline mounted in the kitchen, making you jump. \n\n \n\n \"Shit!\" she says, unwrapping herself from you and smooths her skirt down as she walks over to the phone and picks it up.\n\n \n\n \"Hello?\" Jen answers in a neutral voice, before her eyes widen. \"Oh, hi Daddy!\", she says in a higher pitch than you've come to know she only uses when talking to her father. Jennifer meets your eye and mouths \"Sorry!\" to you as she begins the conversation.\n\n \n\n You sigh, and walk over to the sofa. Based on past experience, you know she's going to be a while. You turn on the TV and put on an old sitcom to pass the time.\n\n \n\n Forty-five minutes later, Jennifer comes back in from the kitchen. She smiles, apologetically. \n\n \n\n \"It's okay,\" you say before she can speak. \"Come here and let's watch TV.\" She snuggles over to you as you wrap your arm around her. \"This is a really good one. Have you seen it?\"\n\n \n\n She looks up at you, shaking her head. Then rests her head on your chest as you watch TV together.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “I actually… have to go,” you stammer. “I need an early night and I said I’d help Emily study tomorrow.”\n\n \n\n Jennifer looks back at you, crestfallen. She pauses for a long moment before speaking. “I understand. Emily’s education has to come first.”\n\n \n\n She slinks off your body and begins cleaning up the table. You watch her, feeling guilty at rejecting her. You help her clean up the dishes and finally break the silence hanging in the room.\n\n \n\n “I love you, you know,” you tell her.\n\n \n\n “I love you too,” she says, finally smiling.\n\n \n\n You both clean-up dinner and wash the dishes, feeling a bit better as you share the tenderness of the moment. Before long, everything is done, and you are both flicking washing up bubbles at each other playfully.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "You step up to the ropes and appraise the challenge. Mr. Beach looks over as you do so. “It’s simple, Phillips. Climb the rope and get to the top. Do you want a demo?”\n\n \n\n You ignore him and step up to the ropes. You watch one of the other girls wrap her legs around it and pull herself up, using her trainers to remain steady. No problem, you think.\n\n \n\n Then you see how the girl parts her legs to push herself up with her feet. You see straight up her skirt.\n\n \n\n You hear the boys giggling, as they look up high above the gym to see everything too.\n\n \n\n More worryingly are the boys opting out of the lesson. They sit on the benches, still dressed in their school uniform. You can see that unlike everyone else, they still have their phones. Covertly, they are filming every girl that goes up the rope.\n\n \n\n If you do this, there will be videos of Emily all over the internet, showing her gym briefs to the world.\n\n \n\n “Come on, Phillips!” Mr. Beach shouts. “What’s the matter, afraid you’ll break a nail?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n Faced with no choice, you wrap your legs around the rope and pull yourself off the floor. You dig your trainers into rope too, and start pushing your way up, keeping your head against the rope for balance.\n\n \n\n You realise the only way to use your legs is to spread them open and push. You glance over at the boys sitting out of PE as you do so, seeing the phones videoing you flashing the class.\n\n \n\n You push your face close to the rope to remain balance, noticing it reeks of sweat and odour. Halfway up, you realise that both boys and girls alike have rubbed their genitals against this rope hundreds of times before.\n\n \n\n The smells do overwhelm you, but instead of making you nauseous you find yourself grinning. Grinning at how you open your legs to push up, and how you close them again as you stretch out. Grinning at the crowd looking up at you. Grinning at the boys filming you. You can almost smell the boys rubbing their crotches against the rope, and now you are pushing your face against it to inhale their scents.\n\n \n\n By the time you make it to the top, you are keeping your legs parted more than you need to, showing your briefs to them in the best possible angle for the shot.\n\n \n\n As the stale sweat continues to move up into your nostrils, you feel something odd. You feel desired. Wanted. And it’s nice.\n\n \n\n “Well done Phillips!” Mr. Beach says. “Get down and move on to the next exercise.”\n\n \n\n You clamber down the rope, finding it easier to breath on the ground. Only then do you think about what you did at the top of that rope. \n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n “I don’t think I’ve got the strength to do this, Mr. Beach,” you tell him. \"I’m going to sit this one out.”\n\n \n\n “Another forfeit over here, kids!” Mr. Beach cries out, pointing to you. “Phillips is going to be cleaning the gym for you if she’s not careful!”\n\n \n\n The other girls complete the challenge. You avoid their smug glances.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n\n Your group leaps at the climbing wall as you approach and a couple of the girls make it halfway to the top within a few moves. You get a feel for the handles you need to grasp on to in order to progress. You begin to climb up the wall yourself.\n\n \n\n Everything is going well until you almost get to the top. The wall inclines near the peak and you find yourself bent over as you stretch out with your hand to the nearest handle. You realise that it’s outside the reach of this body. \n\n \n\n You grimace. You’ve worked out your route based on your old physique. In Emily’s smaller body, though, you haven’t got a chance of making it to the top this way.\n\n \n\n “Use your feet, Phillips!” you hear Mr. Beach crying from below. “Come on, get your leg up!”\n\n \n\n You look at where he’s pointing and you see a handle sticking out, just to the left of your foot. You stretch out cautiously and feel a rush of euphoria when you realise you'll be able to do it --\n\n \n\n Then feel your skirt riding up your legs as you stretch.\n\n \n\n Taking stock of your situation, you realise that, at least in this position bent over the incline, if you stretch out any further your spandex skirt will ride up. You can't tell exactly how high - you're not an expert in skirts, after all - but you know you’ll be bent over up high in front of the entire class. You can’t imagine that would do Emily’s reputation any good at all.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n You grind your teeth as you reach out with your leg.\n\n \n\n Quickly, you place your foot against the handle, but just as quickly you feel your skirt run up your bare thigh and snap around your waist. \n\n \n\n Worst still, you realise all too late that stretching so far with your foot has forced you to forward and you smash your head against the incline of the climbing wall.\n\n \n\n Through the dizziness you hear a number of cheers and whistles from below, as you are stuck up a wall, bent over with your underwear exposed. \n\n \n\n You try to shrug off the dizziness from your head. The climbing wall stinks of sweat. You can’t help but inhale the odours of the dozens of greasy teenage boys that have used this wall before you.\n\n \n\n You reach up a little higher to a handle now in reach and pull yourself slowly. The incline becomes more horizontal as you move upwards and you feel your exposed briefs now rubbing on the hard surface as you pull your body up the wall. The smell of sweat drifts into your nose and you feel yourself taking a deep breath as your briefs rub against the incline.\n\n \n\n You murmur as a flutter of sensations emanate out from your vagina, and you realise that you are rubbing your clit against the wall in front of the whole gym class. \n\n \n\n Worse still, as you take another deep inhalation of the smell of teenage boys that is seeped into the equipment, you can't help but look back to the class and coyly smile.\n\n \n\n “That’s good enough, Phillips,\" Mr. Beach cries from down below. “Come down and get ready for another challenge.”\n\n \n\n You climb down the wall, taking a deep breath at the bottom. A number of students are looking at you. The girls regard you with pity. The boys with lust. \n\n \n\n What is going on in this gym? you think.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n \n You let go of the wall and drop to the mat underneath. “I’m sorry Mr. Beach,” you pant. “I just can’t do it.”\n\n \n \n He looks at you with a smirk and turns back to the gym. “Another forfeit! Poor Phillips just wants to be cleaning your sweat off the floor!”\n\n \n\n You blush as everyone cheers and turn your attention to the remaining challenges.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n\n There’s enough yoga balls for each one of your group. You look at the balls quizzically until Mr. Beach steps up to explain.\n\n \n\n “Honestly Phillips, have you never exercised before?” he chastises you. “Get on your back, lay on the ball, and try to keep your balance. It’s not rocket science, is it?”\n\n \n\n You look to the other girls and follow their lead. You sit on the ball and slowly lean forward, letting the ball run underneath your back and allowing you to lie on it. \n\n \n\n You look down at your body, noticing your breasts prominently sticking up as the ball forces you to arch your back. You notice a few boys looking at you too.\n\n \n\n “Don’t half arse it, Phillips!” Mr. Beach barks, as he stands over you. “The timer only starts when you spread your legs. That’s where the endurance is really tested.”\n\n \n\n You look up at him. He stares down at you laid out in front of him. Are you really going to part your legs in this skirt, revealing your briefs, and have him stand between your legs over you in this position?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n You slide your trainers across the gym floor, hearing them squeak as you widen your stance.\n\n \n\n Looking down, you watch your skirt ride up around your hips as you part your legs, revealing your briefs to your PE teacher and the rest of the class.\n\n \n\n “Wider!” Mr. Beach cries. “Come on, Phillips. My nan can do better than that, god rest her soul.”\n\n \n\n The sound of your squeaking trainers signals for everyone to stare at you, as you push your hips up to spread your legs even further. \n\n \n\n Finally when you can go no more, you look up over your breasts and see Mr. Beach staring at his stopwatch, all the while standing right in-between your thighs.\n\n \n\n You feel more exposed than you have in your entire life, laid out like you were waiting for him to climb on top of you. The smell of sweat permeates the air, and you feel the smells wafting into your nostrils. \n\n \n\n Something about the smell and the physical exercise sends your mind reeling, as if in a foggy haze. You feel yourself biting your lip, staring up at Mr. Beach, waiting for him to look down at you.\n\n \n\n “That’s enough, Phillips.” He says, after his watch beeps. “You’ve passed this round.”\n\n \n\n You roll off the ball and stand up, watching Mr. Beach run across the gym to supervise another challenge. You notice that whilst watching him, you are biting your lip again.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>\n \n\n You let the ball slip out from behind your back and you fall to the floor with a thump. Mr. Beach snorts derisively.\n\n \n\n “Another forfeit over here!” he shouts to the class. “Phillips just wants to clean up after you lot!”\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n \n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n <>",

    "text": "**Charlton School - Kitchen**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Kitchen.png]\n\n \n\n You’re thankful that the next item on your schedule is lunch. You follow the other students to the cafeteria and spot Michelle waiting in the lunchline. “Hey Em!” she shouts when she sees you. “Get us a table and I’ll bring us both over something to eat!”\n\n \n\n You find a vacant table away from most of the students and sit down. Whilst waiting, you check the remaining lessons for the day, hopeful that now you've found Liz and taken the exam you can soon be home and back looking like, well you.\n\n \n\n One more lesson to go, according to the schedule. Physical Education. Next to the class is the number “504” written in Emily’s handwriting.\n\n \n\n A shadow falls over the schedule and you look up to see a tall athletic girl in a cheerleader outfit towering over you. “So you’re the girl that Jake has been talking about?”\n\n \n\n “Jake?” you ask, trying to recall the name. Then you remember. The jock from the start of the day, who was bullying Dennis outside.\n\n \n\n “The quarterback. And my boyfriend,” the girl says. Without asking, she sits down opposite you. “You don’t seem much to me. But…” she looks you up and down. “You might have potential.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n “I’m Christina,” she replies. “Chrissie for short. I run the cheerleader squad at Charlton. Run it with an iron fist.” She smirks.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n \n “Potential for joining us, of course. You might look like a mousy bookworm, but I can see what Jake was talking about. With a bit of work, you could be a real stunner.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n \n \n \n \n Not wanting to complicate Emily’s life, you try to dismiss Christina in the gentlest way possible. “I would love to, but I need to concentrate on my studies.”\n\n \n\n Chrissie laughs. “Oh you don’t need to worry about that. Cheerleaders get special privileges with study. In fact, if you wanted to ensure you get a top grade, there’s no better way than to join the team.”\n\n \n\n You look back at her. She is certainly beautiful. In your male form, you would be flattered just talking to her. But there’s something predatory about her tone. She makes you feel uneasy. \n\n \n\n “Am I interrupting?\" you hear Michelle say as she walks back from the lunch queue, carrying two plates of food. \n\n \n\n Christina eyes her sceptically, but shrugs and gestures to an empty seat. “Please. Join us.”\n\n \n\n Michelle puts a tray in front of you. You glance down at the food. Salad and salmon, with a side of carrot sticks. You sigh.\n\n \n\n “I was just gauging whether Emily here would be interested in trying out for the squad,” Christina continues. “Maybe you’d be interested too?”\n\n \n\n Michelle tucks into her food, smiling as she does so. “Me? A cheerleader! I’m not sure I have the right figure for that.”\n\n \n\n “Don’t be silly,” Christina replies. “You would fit right in. And we can work on the more physical attributes that need a bit of work.”\n\n \n\n Michelle continues eating, staring up at Christina. “Yes, I would fit right in. You can easily spruce up someone with the right attitude too!”\n\n \n\n Christina glances back at you, then to your food. “Aren’t you going to eat that?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You shrug and begin to eat the food. In spite of the bland nature of the meal, it tastes delicious. You soon find yourself eating quickly, savouring every bite.\n\n \n\n “So what do you say, Emily?” Christina continues the conversation. “With a bit of work, you’d be a perfect cheerleader. Jake and the boys would love to see you cheer.”\n\n \n\n You nod, finding Christina to be very persuasive. You think about yourself in the outfit that Christina is wearing, possibly with some blonde hair, with the football team throwing appreciative glances your way. \n\n \n\n “I’d like that,” you find yourself saying. \n\n \n\n Michelle squeals and hugs you. “This is going to be so much fun, Em. You and I, on the cheerleading squad.”\n\n \n\n Christina smiles. “Well, we’re not there yet. We practice everyday after school. You can tryout then. Wear something you can move in. And we’ll see how good you are.”\n\n \n\n You find yourself nodding. “I’ll be there.”\n\n \n\n Michelle hugs you again. Christina smiles narrowly again and leaves.\n\n \n\n Finishing your food, you reflect back on the conversation. You were imagining Emily with blonde hair and in a cheerleader outfit. But you were also imagining it was you.\n\n \n\n “Wow!” you hear Michelle say. “Gotta’ run to class, but I’ll text you later. Tomorrow is going to be a hoot!” She skips off, clearly excited by the thoughts of tryouts.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You push the plate back and tell Christina you’re not hungry. She frowns, staring at you. “A good cheerleader needs to eat,” she tells you. “After all, it takes a lot of strength and muscle to do what we do.”\n\n \n\n “Thanks, but I think I’m going to concentrate on my studies,” you tell her. \n\n \n\n You feel Michelle elbow you in the ribs. “Come on Em! Don’t blow my chance to get on the squad!”\n\n \n\n Christina smiles thinly, looking back at you. “Just think it over. We practice everyday after school. You can tryout then. If you change your mind, come along. There’s two spots available.”\n\n \n\n “I’m sure I can convince her!” Michelle replies. Christina nods and gets up, walking off.\n\n \n\n Michelle doesn’t keep quiet for long, even as she chows down her food. “Come on Em! Did you hear what Chrissie said? I would fit right in. And they can even work on making us look the part!”\n\n \n\n You stare back at Michelle, eying her carefully. You remember when you first met her. When Emily brought her round for dinner one night. You remember she was certainly energetic, but not as… excitable. Bouncy?\n\n \n\n *Ditzy?*\n\n \n\n “I’ll consider it,” you say to appease her. The bell rings. “Now, I have to get to my next class.”\n\n \n\n “Text me when you get home!” Michelle shouts after you as you leave, smiling. \n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Charlton School - Girls Changing Room**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Changing_Room.png]\n\n \n\n Of all the lessons you had to attend today, Physical Education would have been at the bottom of your list. Even walking through the door of the girl's changing rooms makes you queasy.\n\n \n\n That Emily’s year is full of eighteen year olds makes no difference to how sleazy you currently feel. You are entering the changing room of a bunch of girls. \n\n \n\n You notice a line of lockers in a side room by the entrance and dart in there before you see anything. Girls are opening them up and taking out their gym gear. \n\n \n\n You remember the number Emily scrawled on the schedule - 504. There’s no lock, so you open it and find Emily's Charlton-issued PE uniform. \n\n \n\n You hold it up as you take it out. You grimace. The white polo shirt is fine, if baggy and threadbare. Thankfully you wore a white bra today. The sneakers and ankle socks are okay too. \n\n \n\n The issue is the gym briefs and the matching orange skirt. To call it a skirt would be a stretch. The spandex material will only barely cover your bum. You’ve seen girls at clubs with longer skirts than this.\n\n \n\n You hear the chatter of the girls getting changed in the main changing room. You realise you can decide to hold back in here whilst they change.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n Feeling like you absolutely should not be here, you hang back and wait for the other girls to dress. Only when they have gone do you feel right in walking back into the main part of the changing room.\n\n \n\n You take the clothes over to a bench and begin dressing. You pull up the skirt over your gym briefs and look at yourself in the mirror. Your toned legs are on clearly display for anyone to look at. And you know that there’s a gym full of teenage boys waiting to do just that very thing.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n Not wanting to wait, you walk into the changing room and put your clothes down on a bench. The other girls are in states of dress and undress, chattering and gossiping as if this is normal.\n\n \n\n You try not to glance, but it’s challenging. You are surrounded by legs and breasts and bums. You would say it's like a dream, but then you would be feeling aroused. Instead, you feel nervous, frightened, and even a little intimidated by some of the other girls bodies.\n\n \n\n Quickly, you put on the polo shirt and pull up the skirt over your gym briefs. You look at yourself in the mirror. Your toned legs are on display for anyone to see. Fortunately, every girl in the changing room is wearing the same thing. You exit the changing room in amongst the girls, blending in with the crowd.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Charlton School - Girls Changing Room**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Changing_Room.png]\n\n \n\n You head back to the changing rooms and don’t bother with a shower, given it’s the last lesson of the day. Instead, you pull your school jumper over your PE blouse and head home, hopeful that Elizabeth was right about the amulet just needing a recharge. \n\n \n\n One thing that you aren't hopeful about is what tomorrow will bring at work. You know that your boss doesn't do sick leave. You know Thompson will have docked your performance for missing the afternoon.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

It’s been eight years since you went to school, but even back then things weren't so traditional. By sixteen, you were wearing jeans and a hoodie to your classes. Out here in Charlton, things are very different.\n\n \n\n \"In here, Em!\" Michelle beams, nodding to a door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n **Charlton School - Main Corridor**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Corridor.png]\n\n \n\n You file out into the bustling corridor as students busily go to their lessons.\n\n \n\n “Hey!” you hear a voice whisper. “Over here!”\n\n \n\n You turn and see Elizabeth skulking in a stairwell. She beckons you over.\n\n \n\n “Wow. Just wow,” she says looking at you. \"It worked, didn’t it. It’s you in there, isn’t it ?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “There’s too much to discuss here,” she replies, still staring at you with a grin and wide eyes. “Know that there’s nothing to worry about. This can be reversed. The amulet just needs a bit of time to recharge.”\n\n \n\n She looks you up and down appraisingly. “Tell me. How does it feel to be a girl?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n “How do you think it is?” you snap. “I am a twenty-five year old man and I'm in the body of an eighteen year old girl. My sister’s body, no less.”\n\n \n\n Liz tries to stifle her enthusiasm and show some empathy. “I know, I know. Look, if it’s any consolation, I had no idea it would work. I just thought that Emily needed some help, I had something that might do the trick and I also got to see if this was legit.”\n\n \n\n She leans in and whispers. “You see, I found it in a junk shop. I’d been researching bits on magic for a while. There’s some shady stuff happening around here. I didn’t know if any of it was real. But then… look at you!” she says, betraying some of her enthusiasm for the topic.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “I don’t know,” you say honestly. “I'm coping. Weird being so small and so fragile. And these clothes are just ridiculous.”\n\n \n\n She smiles and laughs. “Oh try wearing a miniskirt and a corset, then tell me how tough girl’s clothing is. You can’t breathe and you’re also worried every moment that you're flashing some guy a look at your panties.”\n\n \n\n Noting your obvious uncomfortableness with the conversation, Liz pauses and changes her tone to a more sympathetic one.\n\n \n\n “Look, I didn’t know this would work. I found the amulet in a junk shop and when your sister mentioned her predicament, I realised you would get to help your sister and I got to see if magic was real. It’s a win-win in my book.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n “Nevermind how I feel,” you bark. “You're going to tell me what you did, right now.”\n\n \n\n “Alright, alright,” Liz says, trying to maintain some composure. “I guess that’s fair. Look, I don’t know the ins and outs of it. I’m new to all this myself.”\n\n \n\n She looks around, making sure no one is listening. “I noticed some odd things happening at this school and I did some research. I didn’t believe it at first, but I started trying some things. Small things, to begin with. And then I found that old amulet in a junk shop. I recognised it from some things I’d read. I didn’t know if it would work, but then…” she gestures to you. “I guess it did. How amazing was that! It seems magic is real!”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n\n “Like I said, I think it just needs some time to recharge. When the emerald is glowing again, just picture the ideal version of yourself. You should become you again.”\n\n \n\n “What about the times of trouble stuff?” you ask. “And that line on the note about only helping those who need aid. How does that work?”\n\n \n\n “It looks like you definitely need aid, so I think we’re fine on that.” Liz quips. “Plus, and this is the real interesting part, I think you could help to bend that clause just a bit, if you take the long view.”\n\n \n\n \n \n “You looked at the clock in that test, didn’t you?” she whispers. “I saw you. Time just disappeared, didn’t it? And those questions felt harder every time you did, even for a maths brain like you. That wasn’t you being sluggish. There’s something going on at this school.”\n\n \n “I saw you glance at the clock, right?” she whispers. “Good job you didn’t look again, because it does some funky stuff. Time disappears, and you find yourself, well, your brain seems slower. That’s not a reflection on the people here. They are doing something to manipulate us.”\n\n \n \n \n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n \"What's wrong with this school?\" you ask, narrowing your eyes.\n\n \n\n “Look around,” Liz says, glancing around the emptying corridor. “This place is out of the last century. They have blackboards. Old desks. And don’t get me started on the mandated uniform. This is like some sick version of an old man’s fantasy of a boarding school.”\n\n \n\n “I don’t think this is natural,” she continues. “That clock is just one of the weird things going on here. So - and this is where you can come in - I think you can help get to the bottom of what’s happening. Definitely fulfils the times of trouble and those who need aid, don’t you think?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You look around and grimace. \"Yeah,\" you admit. \"But what can I do about it?\"\n\n \n\n “Use your brain,” Liz chides. “You’re an adult. We're at school. You can do some investigating in the daytime. See what else is happening in Charlton. I’m sure you can get far, especially now with that amulet. It's like you sort of have some kind of superpowers.” She smiles, in spite of herself, and takes her glasses off to wipe the lenses.\n\n \n\n “One thing though. Be careful how you use it. Just as we’re bending the rules of it only working for those in need, that line about shaping the person within worries me. This place does things to your mind. Slide too far and you –”\n\n \n\n “Why are you hanging about in the corridor?” you hear a voice bark from back at the entrance to the classroom. \n\n \n\n You turn to see Mr. Rogers standing in the doorway, looking at you both with a scowl.\n\n \n\n “Just changing our lockers, sir,” Liz replies, before leaning into you. “I’ll speak to you later.” She slinks off, and seeing the look from Mr. Rogers still watching you, you glance at your schedule. Lunchtime.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Charlton School - Gates**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Gates.png]\n\n \n\n Charlton Upper School looks like it was built in Victorian Times and hasn’t been updated since. The imposing brick school rests back from the road and is surrounded by iron rails. Inside, students stand talking in groups of girls and boys.\n\n \n\n You approach from the opposite side of the street, take a deep breath and cross the road to stand out the front of the school.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You stand by the entrance, conscious of your new form. Thankfully no one pays that much attention, aside from the occasional grin from some boys. You avoid their eyes as they walk past, knowing what goes through the minds of teenage guys all too well.\n\n \n\n “Hey nerd!” you hear a voice say. \n\n \n\n Instinctively you look up and see a muscular teenager in a quarterback jacket approaching you. \n\n \n\n You begin to clam up, but the jock walks straight past you and gets right up in the face of a small boy with glasses nearby. You can’t be certain, but you have the feeling that he was standing there staring at you.\n\n \n\n “Hey nerd, I’m talking to you,” the jock says, shoving the other boy against the railings.\n\n \n\n “It’s Dennis,” the boy mutters. “My name’s Dennis.”\n\n \n\n “No, it’s not,” the jock says. “It’s nerd. N-E-R-D. Nerd. And nerds shouldn’t be eying up girls outside school.”\n\n \n\n Dennis glances over at you then turns back to the jock. \"I wasn't looking at her, I swear!\"\n\n \n\n Jake grabs Dennis' by the ear and twists it. He cries out in pain. \"Yes you were, nerd. Yes you were. You perving on her, like you always do.\"\n\n \n\n He looks over to you, still clutching Dennis' ear. \"What do you say? Do you want to hear an apology from him?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Leave him alone,” you say, hearing the timidness in your voice.\n\n \n\n Jake raises and eyebrow and releases Dennis, who drops clutching his ear. “Oh,” he says as he walks over to you. “I didn’t realise you were so in love.”\n\n \n\n He steps closer, absolutely standing in your own personal space. He grins at you. “I’ve seen you around, but we’ve never met before. I’m Jake. How about I show you what a real man looks like?”\n\n \n\n “He’s a real man,” you mutter, aware of how tall and overbearing Jake is compared to your new body.\n\n \n\n “Is that right?” I didn’t know girls went for guys with small dicks. Unless you’re the domineering type.” He glances you up and down again. \"Somehow I don’t think that’s you.”\n\n \n\n He leans in and you can smell his cheap deodorant and the musk of his jacket. You stand still, looking up at him as defiantly as you can. \n\n \n\n “Yeah, I bet you’re the other type,” he murmurs. “You might be all for feminism and books and nerds, but deep down I bet you just want a man to tell you what to do.”\n\n \n\n Before you can reply, you hear an authoritarian voice from behind you. “That’s enough, Duncan!”\n\n \n\n You glance over Jake’s shoulder and see a stocky middle-aged man in short shorts and a tracksuit jacket looking over at you both. “You can flirt on your own time. Inside.”\n\n \n\n “Sorry Coach,” Jake says as he withdraws. He flashes you a smile and then walks through the school gates. The man in shorts looks at you for a moment, then follows him inside.\n\n \n\n Feeling your pulse slow, you look around to see all the other students staring at you. You meet Dennis’ eyes for a moment, before he looks away and hurries inside too.\n\n \n\n The first bell hasn't even rung and you're either being hit on or intimidated by every boy you see.\n\n \n\n “Oh my god, Emily!” A voice brings you out of your thoughts and to look around to see a young woman approaching. You recognise her from a few nights she’s come over for dinner. This is Emily’s friend, Michelle.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Terrified, you don’t say a word. The jock takes this as a sign to continue and turns back to Dennis, shoving him hard against the rails, still holding on to one ear.\n\n \n\n “Please Jake, don’t hurt me!” Dennis cries, on the verge of tears.\n\n \n\n “It’s not nice to leer at girls,” Jake snarls. “Especially those that are way out of your league. I bet you were going to follow her to the stairwell, weren't you? Take some upskirt photos of her as she went up the stairs, like you did to my girlfriend.”\n\n \n\n “I wasn't!” Dennis cries, visibly shaking. You notice there’s a group of pupils now stood around, watching the situation unfold.\n\n \n\n “Don't lie! It's what you do to all the new girls!” Jake says. “She's been here for months, I'm surprised you haven't started selling some pervy pictures of her already.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis is crying now, as Jake continues to twist his ear. “Please! Let me go!”\n\n \n\n “Oh I'll let you go. But first, a warning to stop your little upskirt perving, and a little payback for doing it to Chrissie!\"\n\n \n\n You watch as Jake pulls back his fist. Dennis quivers, accepting his fate.\n\n \n\n \"That’s enough, Duncan.” you hear an authoritarian voice bark. \n\n \n\n You glance over and see a stocky middle-aged man in short shorts and a tracksuit jacket looking over at Jake and Dennis. “You can fight on your own time. Inside.”\n\n \n\n “Sorry, Coach,” Jake says as he withdraws. He flashes a menacing smile at Dennis and then walks through the school gates. The man in shorts looks at Dennis with derision for a moment, then follows after Jake. \n\n \n\n You look around, watching the other students disperse. You meet Dennis’ eyes for a moment, before he looks away and hurries into the school too.\n\n \n\n You are soon left alone with your thoughts. Day one and some guy is already trying to take creepy photos of me, you think despairingly. And Jake was going to beat him up for it too.\n\n \n\n Day one?\n\n \n\n “Oh my god, Emily!” you hear, bringing you out of your thoughts. You spin to see a young woman approaching. You recognise her from a few nights she’s come over for dinner. This is Emily’s friend, Michelle.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You smile as Michelle approaches. Her strawberry blonde hair flows around her face in curls. She’s slightly shorter than you, but she's definitely grown in other areas. You feel your cheeks redden as you realise you’ve been checking her out.\n\n \n\n “What drama for before school!” she says, slyly. “I must admit, I wouldn’t have minded seeing Jake pummel Dennis, even though he is a brute. Dennis is such a sleaze.”\n\n \n\n You nod, trying to stay as noncommittal to any conversation as you can. Thankfully, Michelle likes to talk.\n\n \n\n “So, did you do last minute cramming for the Maths test today? Hopefully your brother gave you some last minute pointers. I bet he's nice, like that. But don’t fret, it’s an easy one, okay?”\n\n \n\n You nod. Somehow, passing a Maths test this morning is the least of your problems.\n\n \n\n The bell rings and Michelle grabs your hand. “Come on! Let’s get to class.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Charlton School - Gymnasium**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Gym.png]\n\n \n\n \n Walking slowly, you enter the gym and notice the girls are sitting on one side of the gym, and the boys on the other.\n\n \n\n Mr. Beach looks at you appraisingly as you walk in. He's not the only one. Everyone is staring at you.\n\n \n\n “Nice of you to join us, Phillips,” he says. “I’m sure the boys appreciate it.\"\n\n \n\n There’s a few wolf whistles and cheers as you sit down with the girls, who mostly roll their eyes and whisper. You clamp your legs tight together, aware the boys are looking over and trying to see up skirts.\n\n \n You enter the gym with the other girls to see the boys entering too, sitting on the opposite side. You walk with the other girls and sit opposite, careful to keep your legs together to prevent the boys from looking up your skirt.\n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Alright kids,” he begins. “Wet weather activities. Today you’ll be doing obstacle challenges. Five minutes on each one, split into groups of five. Girls stay with girls, boys stay with boys. Try to complete each one. Those who don’t will be cleaning up the gym after the lesson.”\n\n \n\n There’s a murmuring as the students begin to break into groups. Thankfully Emily is not a social pariah, so a group of girls welcome you into their group.\n\n \n\n You look around the gym at the obstacles. Ropes, a climbing wall and some yoga balls. You let out a small sigh of relief. It’s been a while, you think, but these seem achievable to you. \n\n \n\n \"Come on kiddies,\" you hear Beach bellow. \"Get on with it!\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You look around the gym at the activities. Other students are racing to claim what they deem the best activities to begin with.\n\n \n\n “Where should we start?” one of the girls in your group asks you.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n Taking a deep breath, you look around at the gym to the activities you've still got to attempt.\n\n \n\n You notice that your group is looking to you now for direction. \"What next?\" one of the girls asks.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n With all three challenges attempted, you regain control of your breath and sit down with the rest of the girls, waiting for everyone to finish.\n\n \n\n Once everyone is seated, Mr. Beach looks at his noteboard. “Alright kids, the results are in. As always, some good successes, some not so good attempts. Whilst there are many winners today, there can only be one loser. And today, that is…”\n\n \n\n < 1>>\n “Heather Oats!”\n\n \n\n You look over, following the other girls stares. A waifish girl gasps. Mr. Beach smiles at her. \n\n \n\n “That’s right, Oats, you’re on cleaning duty. The rest of you, head to the locker rooms.”\n\n \n\n You join the other girls, leaving Heather sitting on the bench on her own.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Emily Phillips!”\n\n \n\n The other girls turn to look at you, all smiling darkly. Mr. Beach steps up and offers a similar smile. \n\n \n\n “That’s right, Phillips. You’re on cleaning duty. The rest of you, head to the locker rooms.”\n\n \n\n You watch as the other students walk out, soon leaving you alone in the gym. After a couple of minutes, Mr. Beach returns with a bucket of warm water and a towel. He tosses it down in front of you.\n\n \n\n “Alright Phillips, as forfeit your going to clean the gym for thirty minutes. You can clean what you like, but one thing I do want to see is this floor spick and span. So get to it.”\n\n \n\n He sets his stopwatch and waits for you to start cleaning.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n Feeling ashamed, you get down on your hands and knees to begin cleaning. The smell of stale sweat is everywhere. You can almost taste it. The warm water Mr. Beach has given you does nothing to hide it too. Soon you feel as though you're bathing in it.\n\n \n\n Instead of being repulsed by it, though, in time you find yourself adjusting to it. As you clean the gym floorboards, you begin to think about the people who must have used this gym over the years. The dozens, if not hundreds, of boys who sweated over these floors.\n\n \n\n And the smell might be the sweat of boys barely used to using deodorant, but you begin to think about those boys and their physical education. Their muscular bodies playing basketball. Sweat dripping down their toned abs. A lot of testosterone is baked into these boards.\n\n \n\n You idly look up from the floor, seeing Mr. Beach watching you perched on a vaulting box. You look up at him as you clean on all fours. \n\n \n\n You notice that in spite of his age, he too has kept up his physique. He is toned, fit and has a pair of manly thighs on display below his short shorts.\n\n \n\n “Keep it up, Phillips,” he says to you. “We might have found something you’re good at.”\n\n \n\n Absent-mindedly you feel yourself moving to clean right in front of the box he perches on. Leaning over to get your elbow working on a particularly grimy sweat stain, you feel your polo shirt hanging down, giving him a good look down your top at your breasts.\n\n \n\n “Like this sir?” you find yourself purring.\n\n \n\n He smirks. “Oh yes, Phillips. Careful though, we wouldn’t want you to rub your shirt on the floor. It would get all dirty, and then what would we do?”\n\n \n\n “I don’t know sir,” you say, wringing out the towel when his watch goes off and savouring in the smell of the dirty water. You stare back up at him. “Will that be all, sir?”\n\n \n\n He grins. “Yes Phillips. For now. Go along to the changing rooms. I’ll see you again, I’m sure.”\n\n \n\n You smile coyly at him and then walk out of the gym. Something didn't feel right about that entire experience, but for the life of you, you can't put your finger on it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Charlton School - Maths Room**\n\n [image: ./images/School_Maths_Room.png]\n\n \n\n Michelle leads you into a classroom a minute before the lesson starts. She takes a seat at one of the desks near the front and you sit down at the one next to her. She leans over and looks at you.\n\n \n\n “Did you go without make-up today, Em?” she asks you conspiratorially. “You look like you’ve been up all night. What will the boys say?” She winks at you. \n\n \n\n The conversation is interrupted by the entrance of an aging man dressed in a suit and tie. As soon as he steps in the idle chatter from the other students simmers down. \n\n \n\n “Alright, alright, close those mouths,” he says, shutting the door behind him and drawing all conversations to silence.\n\n \n\n You look up at him, very aware that your desk at the front of the classroom does nothing to hide your legs. You push them together, trying to retain some level of modesty. You think how Emily would be mortified if you flashed her teacher whilst pretending to be her.\n\n \n\n “Good morning class,” the man says, almost in a singsong.\n\n \n\n “Good morning Mr. Rogers,” the class parrots back.\n\n \n\n “Today is the day you’ve all been waiting for,” Mr. Rogers says, as he takes a seat behind his wooden desk. “This term’s Maths exam. I hope you’ve been studying.”\n\n \n\n The door that Mr. Rogers closed suddenly bursts open and a girl almost falls in through the entrance. She's dressed generally like another student, but her uniform is pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable and her make-up is definitely on the darker side of what's permitted.\n\n \n\n “Take a seat, Miss Pleasant,” Mr. Rogers says. “I’m sure you are as excited to take this test as I am to mark it.\"\n\n \n\n You watch the girl walk through the classroom. She smiles as she takes a seat a row back from you. This has to be Elizabeth.\n\n \n\n “Now,” Mr. Rogers continues. “If there are no further interruptions, we may begin. You will find your exam in your desk drawer. You have fifty minutes. No calculators. No phones. And above all, no talking. Your time starts now.”\n\n \n\n There is a mad rush as each student takes out their exam papers from their drawer and begins scribbling down their names at the top.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You open the desk drawer and take out the maths exam. You glance over the questions and your heart skips. Despite everything that has happened today, at least this is what you expected.\n\n \n\n You glance up at the ticking clock above the blackboard. You won’t need fifty minutes. You can do this in fifteen. Although weirdly enough, you seem to have daydreamed for five already. The clock now shows there is only forty five minutes until the end of the lesson.\n\n \n\n Shrugging, you take out your pencil and are set to answer the first question when a crumpled roll of paper lands on your desk. \n\n \n\n You glance back in the direction of where it came and see Elizabeth looking at you. She looks over the rim of her dainty glasses, puts a finger to her lips, motioning for you to be silent, and then puts her head down to work.\n\n \n\n Your eyes drift to the ball of paper now resting on your desk.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n You glance up at Mr. Rogers, who seems absorbed in a book. Cautiously, you reach over and open it up to reveal some scribbly writing in black pen.\n\n \n\n Did it work? Are you really ? Let’s meet after class. And whatever you do, don’t look at the clock above the blackboard.\n\n \n\n You look back at Liz, but she’s now concentrating on the exam. You crumple the paper back up, put it in your bag, and return to the test.\n\n \n\n Heeding the words on the note, you set down to business, but not once do you look up at the clock. \n\n \n\n The questions would be challenging for the average eighteen year old, but as you thought they would be, they are easy. Not wanting to draw attention to yourself, you try to take your time answering them, but you can’t help but finish quickly.\n\n \n\n You look up after completing the last question and see that Mr. Rogers is staring at you over the rim of his glasses with interest. “Something wrong, Miss. Phillips?”\n\n \n\n You shake your head. He holds his stare for a moment longer, then returns to his book.\n\n \n\n Soon the bell rings and Mr. Rogers barks for everyone to put their pens down. “That bell is a signal for me, not you. Now leave the exam on your desk and you may go to your next lesson.”\n\n \n\n Students begin filtering out of the room. As you're packing up your things, Michelle leans over to whisper to you. \n\n \n\n “How did you find it? I think I got at least ten right, but they were really hard. Hopefully Mr. Rogers goes easy on me. See you in the cafeteria in a bit!”\n\n \n\n Michelle bounds out the door. You begin to follow, but hear Mr. Rogers voice again. \n\n \n\n “Finished so quickly, Miss. Phillips?”\n\n \n\n You glance back at him, still sitting behind his desk. “I hope for your sake that you studied hard. I will find your exam paper most intriguing.”\n\n \n\n Without saying a word, you walk out. As you notice the time, you briefly wonder about your job. Your real job. You're certain that your boss will have noticed your absence. He'll take note when you're away from the office. You might have aced Emily's exam, but you don't look forward to having to make it up to Thompson tomorrow.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You ignore the note and get to work on the exam questions, trying to keep your mind free from distractions. You answer the first questions with ease, glancing up to see how quickly you are breezing through the exam.\n\n \n\n Discouragingly, you see that another five minutes has passed without you realising. You wince, not understanding where time has gone. \n\n \n\n You turn over the next question and read it a few times. It’s a simple algebra question, but it takes a bit for your brain to get to the answer. It has been a while since you’ve done theory. Still, you find the next question a little odd to understand too.\n\n \n\n You look back up the clock and feel your mouth dropping open. You are only a third of the way through the exam, but over half the lesson has gone. \n\n \n\n The exam isn’t getting easier, either. You spend a long time just reading the next five questions, eventually comprehending what they are asking for. You also make a few basic mistakes that would cause so many bugs if you let them slip through in your day job.\n\n \n\n Come on , you think. Focus. You only have…\n\n \n\n And you glance up at the clock to see you only have five minutes left. \n\n \n\n You begin to hurry, trying to get through as many questions as you can. Rushing leads to a number of mistakes and there’s even a few questions that you just can’t get your head around.\n\n \n\n The bell goes just as you move on to the final question, which you scrawl a guess at. “Pens down!” Mr. Rogers orders. He steps up next to your desk and slaps a ruler against your desk. “That includes you, Miss. Phillips. I will be penalising you for not listening to the bell.”\n\n \n\n Mr. Rogers turns to the whole class. “Alright, now leave the exam on your desk and you may go to your next lesson. You are all dismissed.”\n\n \n\n Students begin filtering out of the room. As you pack up your things, Michelle leans over to whisper to you. \n\n \n\n “How did you find it? I think I got at least ten right, but they were really hard. Hopefully Mr. Rogers goes easy on me. See you in the cafeteria in a bit!”\n\n \n\n Michelle bounds out the door. You begin to follow, but hear Mr. Rogers voice again. \n\n \n\n “Struggled a little there, Miss. Phillips?”\n\n \n\n You glance back at him, still sitting behind his desk. You feel his eyes drifting over your body. “I will find your exam paper most intriguing. I suspect in the future I’ll find you back in my class after school.”\n\n \n\n Without saying a word, you walk out. As you notice the time, you briefly wonder about your job. Your real job. You're certain that your boss will have noticed your absence. He'll take note when you're away from the office. And you didn't even manage to ace Emily's exam. You don't look forward to having to make it up to Thompson tomorrow.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Thompson's Handyman Repairs - Office**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Office.png]\n\n \n\n You walk into the small room full of desks and ancient computers that you somehow have to make do as a contemporary office.\n\n \n\n Sitting down at your desk, you check emails before looking at the bug that forced you to give up your Sunday. Apparently there was a glitch on Friday evening and Gordon was booked for two jobs at once.\n\n \n\n You grimace, bracing for another lecture from the owner, Mr. Thompson.\n\n \n\n “Hey Phillips,” you hear a voice say from behind you.\n\n \n\n You turn and see your co-worker Dan entering, dressed in a cheap suit and smelling like old cologne. He looks back through the door as it closes, waving out to Annie in reception. “I’ll see you later, Annie!”\n\n \n\n He chuckles, taking a seat at the desk opposite and opening a rolodex, as he eyes you with a smirk. \"Didn't expect to see you pulling overtime. Me? I'm already hitting targets. Don't need to work weekends. But I heard Annie was working and thought I could keep her company. Man, that's a piece of arse if ever I saw one,” he says. “Get a few drinks in that one and I bet she’ll be up for it, am I right?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “She’s got a lovely figure,” you reply, trying to match his lecherous tone. He takes that as encouragement and grins.\n\n \n\n “I bet she wouldn’t be picky, too,” he continues. “I reckon you are in with a shot there, mate. Maybe I could take her out for drinks, have some fun in the bathroom, and then I’ll text you to let you know she’s ready for you to pick up sloppy seconds.\"\n\n \n\n His laughter is interrupted by his ringing phone. “Good morning,\" he says as he picks it up. \"Thompson Handyman Repairs. Daniel Mendel speaking. How can I help you?”\n\n \n\n You look back to your screen as Dan takes his call, his loud voice echoing throughout the room.\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I don’t think you should be talking like that at work,” you tell him.\n\n \n\n He frowns at you and waves his hand dismissively as he snorts. “It’s just banter, mate. No need to get your panties in a twist.”\n \n \n\n But thankfully a moment later his phone rings. He picks up the receiver, adopting a smooth salesman tone. “Good morning, Thompson Handyman repairs. Daniel Mendel speaking. How can I help you?”\n\n \n\n You look back at your screen, listening to Dan’s grating voice as he chats to a customer.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n You open up the development window on your computer and try to find the bug that caused Gordon to be double-booked. Whoever worked here before you was an amateur. It’s held together by logic that you quickly see will break as people use it.\n\n \n\n After about an hour of searching in vain, you brace yourself as a door slams open nearby. “Phillips!” you hear someone bark. You look up to see your boss, Mr. Thompson, striding over to you.\n\n \n\n “I’ve just had Sean McTafey on the phone!” he shouts. “He needed Gordon to get over there on Friday to fix a leak in the basement. But thanks to you, Gordon was working over at Harold Sermon’s hotel on a routine check!”\n\n \n\n You look up at your boss and gauge how to respond. An overweight man by any definition, his white shirt is stained from years of profuse sweat. His face is puffy and red, his breathing rapid just from walking out of his office.\n\n \n\n \"It was the old code -,\" you begin.\n\n \n\n “I don’t care why it happened,” he cuts you off. “If that keg cellar isn’t dry by this afternoon, a lot of thirsty people are going to be without a drink after a day out at the Country Club. Get it sorted.”\n\n \n\n Mr. Thompson storms back into his office and slams the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n Feeling blood rush to your face, you try to avoid Dan's stare and get your head down into the code. But you find it hard to focus as adrenaline from being shouted at rushes around your body.\n\n \n\n About an hour into the investigation, Annie walks into the office and makes a beeline for you, smiling sympathetically. \n\n \n\n “Hey , just wondering if you wanted to get some lunch. Maybe some time away will help?”\n\n \n\n You gather from her expression that she’s well aware of the problem and Mr. Thompson’s outburst.\n\n \n\n “Not today, Annie”, you tell her. “I’ve got to get this done before the issue happens again.” \n\n \n\n You don’t have to look around to sense Dan leaping on this opportunity. “I’m free for lunch,” he says to Annie. “Maybe we can grab a drink too. Make it an extended working lunch. I’ve just made a decent sale, Mr. Thompson will be more than happy if I treat his lovely secretary.”\n\n \n\n She looks between you two, then shrugs. “Sure”, she says. “I’ll get my coat.”\n\n \n\n She walks out and you see Dan watching as she leaves, grinning. He smiles at you and follows her, not once letting his cheesy grin fall from his face.\n\n \n\n After he leaves, you turn your attention back to the computer and focus on the problem. At least now Dan's piercing voice won't interrupt your concentration. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Two hours of hard work later and you find the bug, unsurprisingly from legacy code before you started working here.\n\n \n\n Some time later, Dan returns, smelling of alcohol. He falls into his chair and shoots you a look. “What a lunch,” he exclaims. “Annie sure is a hungry girl.”\n\n \n\n You don’t respond to him and continue to finish out your work day in silence.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n Sighing, you stand up and take a deep breath. You catch Dan looking up at you with a quizzical look. “Taking a break?” he asks with smugness in his voice.\n\n \n\n “I think I need it,” you reply, and walk out to the reception area to get some air.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n Unlike your job back in the city, you are least thankful that you now get to go home at 5:30pm on the dot. Even on a Sunday. You watch the clock tick over and say your goodbyes, leaving just as the sun is setting.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n\n **Thompson's Handyman Repairs - Office**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Office.png]\n\n \n\n You and Annie walk back to work, trying not to announce your late lunch. Dan raises an eyebrow as you sit down, but says nothing.\n\n \n\n With a fresh mind, you quickly find the bug that caused the issue. Unsurprisingly it's from legacy code written before you started working here. You send an email to Mr. Thompson explaining the issue and how you resolved it and receive a quick ‘Thanks’ as a reply.\n\n \n\n For the rest of the day, you clean up some of the code and try to ensure that nothing can go wrong overnight with the rest of the incoming bookings.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Thompson Handyman Repairs - Reception**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Reception.png]\n\n \n\n You walk into the reception of Thompson’s Handyman Repairs. It’s no more than a room with a cheap desk and a couple of doors either side. One to the warehouse, where electricians and plumbers store supplies and their vehicles. The other to the office where you spend your days working to bring order to a software system built decades ago.\n\n \n\n “Morning ,” the receptionist says as you enter. Annie is in her early twenties, blonde and pretty. She's always dressed for a much more professional company than the one you work for.\n\n \n\n She is sitting behind the desk, staring up at you with a flirtatious smile that you have come to learn is just her natural demeanour. “How are you today?”\n\n \n\n “Good thanks Annie,” you reply. “Spending Sunday living the dream.” She grimaces at the mention of the day, but tries to smile politely.\n\n \n\n Just then, you feel your phone vibrate in your pocket. Reception is so terrible around Charlton that since moving here you’ve quickly gotten out of the habit of idly scrolling every second you have a spare moment.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You take out your phone and see you have a message from your girlfriend, Jennifer. It’s a picture of her dressed in a short skirt and crop top in front of a changing room mirror. You read the caption.\n\n \n\n **Jennifer:** Put these aside before my shift. Think I might wear it tonight. My place for dinner? Xxx\n \n\n You smile to yourself. There are certainly things you don’t like about Charlton, but Jennifer is not one of them.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n \n **Thompson Handyman Repairs - Reception**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Reception.png]\n\n \n\n Annie looks up at you as you enter the reception, smiling sympathetically.

She smiles warmly, waiting for your response.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <> \n\n “A break would be good,” you say. Annie smiles and stands, revealing her long legs as she puts on her coat.\n\n \n\n “Do you want to go to the hotel restaurant?” she asks. “It’s got a lunchtime special today. Come on, my treat.”\n\n \n\n You open the door for Annie and she walks outside. Following her, you take note of the sun warming your body. It makes you feel better instantly. \n\n \n\n Annie leads you across the road to the Charlton Hotel and you try to ignore Gordon’s van in the car park as she leads you inside.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You shake your head. “Not today, Annie”, you tell her. “I’ve got to get this done before the issue happens again.” \n\n \n\n She nods and offers you a smile. “I’m sure you’ll fix it, . Mr. Thompson can just get in a mood sometimes.”\n\n \n\n She stands and puts on her coat. “We’ll do lunch another time,” she adds. “Good luck.”\n\n \n\n You watch her leave, noting her long legs previously hidden by the desk. She looks back and smiles at you, before leaving. You sigh.\n\n \n\n Returning to your desk, you sit down and get back to the task at hand. You try to ignore Dan looking up.\n\n \n\n “Did Annie just leave for lunch?” he asks. You don’t reply, but he stands up anyway. “I think I’m going to catch-up with her and see if she wants to join me. A nice long-lunch, if you get my drift.” He grins and dashes out the door.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n \n <>",

    "text": "**Thompson's Handyman Repairs - Shop Floor**\n\n [image: ./images/Thompsons_Shop_Floor.png]\n\n \n\n If you were to believe the labourers and electricians, the shop floor is where the actual work for the company takes place. Which they remind you of every opportunity.\n\n \n\n This morning there’s a couple of branded vans parked near the shutters in different states of loading. The rest of the space is covered in plumbing parts and electrical wiring that Thompson’s Handyman Repairs use to charge large sums of money to Charlton residents with no other alternative.\n\n \n\n You notice two employees, Gordon and Clive, loading up their vans, ready for a day’s work.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You know Gordon and Clive primarily through work. Clive is a tall and lean man with an easy going nature that doesn’t fit the stereotype of an electrician. You remember him mentioning that he played touch rugby over the summer with your brother Brock, before he went to University. Lean and nimble, you reckon he'd be a great winger.\n\n \n\n Gordon, on the other hand, could be a bodybuilder. He barely says a word, except when talking about how much he’s benching or how unfit people are at the gym. His attitude makes you feel that people would not want to workout when he’s there, which unfortunately seems to be all the time.\n\n \n\n “What’s happening, Phillips?” Clive says as he sees you. “The boss pulled you in today, too? Mighty nice of you to come in and try to fix the reason we're working overtime.” The words sting a bit, even though his tone is playful and far from mean.\n\n \n\n \"I don't know what's happening,\" you tell Clive. \"It was working fine on Friday.\"\n\n \n\n Clive gives you a grin. \"Always works until it doesn't. So you taking a break from working hard sitting down, or come to see how real men make their living?\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “You wouldn’t have a living if I didn’t sort out the piece of junk that is your booking system,” you reply.\n\n \n\n Clive chuckles. “Pen and paper would suit me fine,” he says. “That’s how I learned at school. Sometimes the old ways are the best. Think that we're in today proves that right.”\n\n \n\n Gordon looks up from his packing, his face the picture of disinterest. He shakes his head as he sees you and returns to his work.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “I don’t think I’m built for doing manual labour,” you respond, playing to his bias. \n\n \n\n He laughs as he looks you up and down. “Don’t worry about it, champ. Some men aren’t just built to do it,” he replies.\n\n \n\n Gordon looks up at you over a stack of boxes he’s carrying. “You should come by the gym,\" he says. “There’s plenty of people in worse shape than you. I’m sure that girl of yours would appreciate you adding some muscle to that body.”\n\n \n\n There’s no hint of joke from Gordon’s face. He returns to packing his van.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

Eighteen and usually perky and positive, she is dressed casually in a T-shirt and jeans.\n\n \n\n “Morning ,” she says as you enter. “How did you sleep?”\n\n \n\n You mutter a neutral reply. You don't ask her the same question, as it's obvious she’s been up all night studying. You can tell the move has been hard for many reasons, but it most prominently shows in her studies. Back in the city she was a top-of-the-class student. Since the move though, she’s been struggling with maintaining an average grade.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You sit down with her and look at the textbook open on the kitchen table. Algebra. Even when you were at school, Maths came naturally for you. Now it feels like child's play.\n \n \n\n Emily smiles meekly as you help her. You spend thirty minutes walking her through how the Maths questions can be solved, but she grows more frustrated with each mistake she makes.\n\n \n\n “I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” she exclaims after missing a step you just talked through. “Even Michelle is doing okay with her grades. I'm way smarter than her!\"\n\n \n\n You remember that despite struggling with school, Emily has at least met someone she can call a friend. \"Maybe this particular type of Maths just suits her?\" you offer, trying to be helpful.\n\n \n\n “It’s like I just can’t keep all of this in my head,\" Emily continues, ignoring your question. \"Everything seems so hard and complicated right now. This all was so simple back… home.”\n\n \n\n The word hangs in the air between you. You look at each other and remember, not for the first time this week, that the move has been tough on the both of you.\n\n \n\n “You’ll get the hang of it,” you say reassuringly. “The test is tomorrow, right? Still another night of studying to get in before then.” \n\n \n\n That causes her to smile at least. Just a little, but you’ll take the win. \n\n \n\n “I’m going to see Jennifer this evening,” you add. “But we can get up early tomorrow and do some last minute cramming.” \n\n \n\n She nods. You can tell she’s still despondent, but she is trying to cling on to the positivity that used to define her.\n\n \n\n “Have a good day,” you say as you get up. “I’ll see you after work.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n **Your home**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home.png]\n\n \n \n You enter your parents house to the familiar sight of Emily hunched over the kitchen table, surrounded by homework. She smiles politely as you walk in, but quickly puts her head back in a book.\n\n \n\n “How’s it going?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n She looks up, tears in her eyes. “, I think I'm going to fail!\" Then the tears begin to stream.\n\n \n\n You put your arm around her and hug her gently. “Look, you’ve still got another night,” you console her. “And plus, I’ll help you cram in the morning. I promise.”\n\n \n\n “I don’t think that’s going to help!” she stammers. “I just can’t get my head around this. I feel so stupid! This is so unlike me! Plus, Mr. Rogers said that if I failed this class, he’d have to keep me back for detention to make up for it!\"\n\n \n\n \"I'm not sure you can get detention for failing an exam,\" you reply.\n\n \n\n \"You can! He apparently did the same to Michelle last term and she had to stay behind after school to do extra work!”\n\n \n\n You look down at your sister. You’ve never seen her like this. Not just her struggling with grades, but her being this emotional. You smile, unsure of what to say to her like this.\n\n \n\n “You can only try your best, Em,” you tell her. “There’s not much else you can ever do.”\n\n \n\n Emily looks up at you, her teary eyes causing her make-up to run a little. You are taken aback momentarily, not noticing before that she had started to wear such heavy make-up. But you don't have a chance to mention it before something else takes your attention. Emily reaches underneath her maths book and pushes something to the centre of the table. “Maybe there is,” she says.\n\n \n\n You look down at the object. It’s an amulet, old and faded, with a green emerald gem embedded in it.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You look down at the amulet. It’s made from a metal you can’t determine, but looks faded and worn. The green emerald, however, sparkles with none of its sheen lost. More noticeably, you feel a sense of warmth irradiating from it.\n\n \n\n “What is this?” you ask her, not taking your eyes off it.\n\n \n\n “A girl at school gave it to me,” Emily says. “When I told her that you were tutoring me, she said that if you would help me this could be the answer to my problems.” She takes out a faded piece of paper and hands it to you. “She also gave me this.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You look at the note. Like the amulet it’s old and faded. You notice some hand writing on one side that reads:\n\n \n\n **For times of trouble, use me well. Take a treasured possession from those who need aide, and see them for who they are in your world. Then say these words. ‘From this item, I see you in your time of need. Now form shape to the person I see within.’**\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Em, what do you think this is?” you say, trying not to laugh. “It sounds like a magic spell.”\n\n \n\n Emily looks up at you, pleadingly. “Maybe it is. Or maybe it’s just some positive affirmations stuff. Either way, it can’t hurt, right? I need all the help I can get.”\n\n \n\n You smile politely at your sister. “I think what would help would be more studying.” \n\n \n\n You see her crestfallen face react to your dismissal and can’t help but want to appease her. You sigh. “If you think it would help,\" you say, \"let’s talk about it tomorrow morning. For now continue studying.”\n\n \n\n Her eyes light up at your gesture. “Thanks ! You're the best!” She turns back to her books and you remember that even though she’s eighteen, she can be so naive sometimes.\n\n \n\n Just then, the landline rings. Even after a couple of months of having almost no phone reception, reverting to a landline seems like you’ve stepped back to another time.\n\n \n\n You pick up the receiver from the wall and answer. The warm voice of your girlfriend greets your ear. “Are you coming over?”\n\n \n\n “I’d love to, Jen,” you say. “I’ll be right over.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n **Your home**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home.png]\n\n \n\n You bid Jennifer farewell and go home, thinking about the day you’ve had.\n\n \n\n All the lights are off when you get in, but notice Emily has fallen asleep at the kitchen table in front of her books. Illuminating the room in a green light is the amulet, lying off to the side of the table where you left it. You don't understand how it does that.\n\n \n\n You wake up Emily and tell her to go to bed. Groggy and half-asleep, she nods. \n\n \n\n You help her up the stairs, then go to your room and collapse in your bed for a restful night.\n\n \n\n Actions\n\n <> \n \n **Your home**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home.png]\n\n \n\n Emily still sits at the kitchen table, now fidgeting in the stuffy uniform that you know she hates. Charlton Upper School mandates it though, as if you were living in the last century. You can’t tell if she's just come down or she snuck back down to study. Her eyes look more tired than you’ve seen before,\n\n \n\n “Morning,” she says sleepily. “How did you sleep?”\n\n \n\n \"Okay,\" you reply. \"Let's see how you are doing.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You sit down again and look at the textbook in front of her. You begin to talk about the first question, but she quickly starts to cry. \n\n \n\n “I can’t do this !” she cries, as you hug her gently. “It’s just all too hard!”\n\n \n\n “Look,” you say reassuringly. “It’s not so bad. Just another hour of studying and I’m sure you’ll be fine.”\n\n \n\n Her hand darts across the table and she pushes the amulet towards you. “It won’t be! Not without this! Please help me, ! Please can we try it! I can’t fail this test!”\n\n \n\n You look at the amulet. “Em,” you begin. “I don’t think this is the answer…”\n\n \n\n “Please !” she cuts you off. “I know it’s stupid. But I can’t fail. If I fail, then who knows if I’ll be able to graduate. I… we,” she emphasises, “need to do anything to get me to pass.”\n\n \n\n You picks up the amulet. Even now, there’s something odd about it that unsettles you. But seeing Emily like this is a hundred times worse.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Alright, if you think this will help,” you say, putting it around your neck. You feel a bit stupid wearing the ancient trinket, but if you can convince Emily you are putting your heart into it she might get some confidence for her exam.\n\n \n\n You pick up the note and read the instructions out loud. “Alright, For times of trouble, use me well. Take a treasured possession from those who need aid, and see them for who they are in your world.”\n\n \n\n You look to Emily. “I need something from you to hold.\"\n\n \n\n She nods and reaches into her purse, pulling out some lipgloss. You raise an eyebrow. “It calms me down,” she says, but you don’t push her new interest in cosmetics any further.\n\n \n\n Holding on to the lipgloss, you visualise Emily in your mind. You think of a mental picture from happier times, before you moved here. A memory surfaces in your brain. Back at the beginning of summer, not four months ago, when your parents took you all to the beach. Emily, wearing a sundress, carefree, confident and happy. \n\n \n\n You feel the emerald warming your chest against your shirt as you picture the image. The warmth makes you feel something else. Carefree. Confident. Happy. You almost feel them as things you're experiencing right now for yourself. \n\n \n\n “Okay, here goes,” you tell Emily. “From this item, I see you in your time of need. Now form shape to the person I see within.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n “Look, I’m going to prove you don’t need this,” you say, putting it around your neck. You feel a bit stupid wearing the ancient trinket, but you need Emily to realise that she’s the only one who can help herself today.\n\n \n\n You pick up the note and read the instructions out loud. “Alright, For times of trouble, use me well. Take a treasured possession from those who need aid, and see them for who they are in your world.”\n\n \n\n You look to Emily. “I need something from you to hold.\"\n\n \n\n She nods and reaches into her purse, pulling out some lipgloss. You raise an eyebrow. “It calms me down,” she says, but you don’t push her new interest in cosmetics any further.\n\n \n\n Holding on to the lipgloss, you visualise Emily in your mind. You think of a mental picture from happier times, before you moved here. A memory surfaces in your brain. Back at the beginning of summer, not four months ago, when your parents took you all to the beach. Emily, wearing a sundress, carefree, confident and happy. \n\n \n\n You feel the emerald warming your chest against your shirt as you picture the image. The warmth makes you feel something else.

Now form shape to the person I see within.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n A moment passes, then another.\n\n \n\n You find yourself sitting at the kitchen table, staring back at your sister, expectation evident in her eyes.\n\n \n\n “I’m sorry Em,” you begin. “It’s just a hokey old -”\n\n \n\n A wave of warm energy rushes across your skin, making your hairs stand up on end. You cry out, feeling as though a burning wave of flames is passing over you. Your have the sensation inside of your organs exploding and contracting and exploding all over again. If your throat wasn't constricting you'd try to throw up your lungs.\n\n \n\n You are barely aware of your surroundings, but feel the hard ceramic floor hit your body as you collapse to the floor. You lie on the cold tiles, but your skin is tingling and your clothes feel like they are burning away.\n\n \n\n And then, bones breaking inside. You cry out again in pain. There's a surging around your chest. Your hips somehow are crushing against each other. Your penis - your wonderful penis - is inflamed with pain.\n\n \n\n A strand of hair passes in front of your blurring vision. Giving into the agony, you pass out.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “? ! Oh my god !”\n\n \n\n You hear a voice, distant and murky, as if you are hearing it from underwater. You feel yourself blinking and see a light blur. Slowly, shapes begin to form and you see you are still lying on the floor.\n\n \n\n You feel something shaking your body. “? ? Oh my god , wake up! Please be alright.”\n\n \n\n You look up in the direction of the voice. You make out your sister, Emily, coming into focus. She stands above you, looking down in horror. \n\n \n\n “Em?” you mutter. Then stop. Something about that wasn’t right.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You look around and immediately see something that definitely isn’t right. You can feel you are lying on the floor of your kitchen, but where your body should be is one of a young girl.\n\n \n\n As you stare down at the body, your brain struggles with incomprehension. You tense your toes to check. You can feel your legs and stomach, but where you feel you can only see toned legs wrapped in a sundress.\n\n \n\n “!”\n\n \n\n You look up at Emily. She is still standing over you. Her mouth is wide open and her eyes full of panic. “Are you… are you… oh my god.”\n\n \n\n “What happened?” you hear your sister say. Then it dawns on you. You said that. \n\n \n\n “Oh my god,” you blurt out. There’s no mistaking it. You are talking, but you sound like a girl. Like your sister.\n\n \n\n “I think you better stand up,” Emily says. “Look in there.” She gestures to the mirror.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <> \n \n Feeling like you are in a dream, you pull yourself up by grabbing on to the table. Even this feels wrong. Your arms look smaller and dainty. Hairless. Feminine.\n\n \n\n You glance over to the mirror, confirming what you already knew. Staring back at you, mouth open, looking struck with terror, is the embodiment of the picture you had in your mind. Your sister, eighteen years old, wearing a sundress.\n\n \n\n You tell your leg to move a little. The girl in the mirror matches your movement. The girl in the mirror.\n\n \n\n You.\n\n \n\n “What?” you exclaim, again hearing your sister's voice. Your movements match the ones in the reflection. There’s a mistake here. You are looking at yourself, and yourself is a duplicate of your sister.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n “Oh my god! What have you done?” you exclaim!\n\n \n\n “Easy ” you hear Emily say. “Breathe. Just breathe” \n\n \n\n You reach out to one of the kitchen chairs and fall down into it, feeling the wood touching your new hairless legs. The amulet bounces on your chest - your breasts - and angrily you rip it off and toss it on to the kitchen table. \n\n \n\n “What the hell, Emily!” you say. “What have you done?”\n\n \n\n “Easy ”, she says, trying to remain calm. “Just breathe. We’ll figure this out together. Just breathe.”\n\n \n\n “I am breathing Emily, I’m just breathing in your body!” you snap. You hear the voice again, a familiar one, but that you struggle to comprehend as your own. You feel a surge of tears coming. “This isn’t happening,\" you stammer. \"This can’t be happening.”\n\n \n\n “Look, it must have been the amulet!” Emily replies, gesturing to the jewellery on the kitchen table. “It must be magic!” \n\n \n\n “There’s no such thing as magic, Em!” You intended to sound venomous, but you catch yourself sounding more meek with the higher voice.\n\n \n\n “Well, I beg to differ,” she says flatly. She signals to your body. “The proof is there, .\"\n\n \n\n You look again at the amulet. Then to the note nearby. You just can't believe that this is real.\n\n \n\n “How did you do it?” you hear Emily asking.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n You pick up the amulet, looking at the infernal trinket. It looks the same, but where there was once a warmth radiating from the emerald, now there is just only a hint of an ember. It almost feels cold to the touch.\n\n \n\n “Maybe it needs time to recharge?” Emily offers, unconvincingly.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n \n You look over the note once more.\n \n \n\n **For times of trouble, use me well. Take a treasured possession from those who need aid, and see them for who they are in your world. Then say these words. ‘From this item, I see you in your time of need. Now form shape to the person I see within.’**\n\n \n\n “I thought of you,” you mutter. Emily frowns as you show her the note. “I thought of you, when I said the words.”\n\n \n\n She looks at it, then looks up with some understanding. “You became how you saw me. In your head.”\n\n \n\n “I thought it would just effect you!” you say. “Not like this, of course, but if there was any mumbo jumbo I thought it would give you positive energy. Or something.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n\n After looking over the amulet and the note, your brain calms down just by a fraction, but enough to try and process the situation. You pictured Emily in a sundress. You are now Emily in a sundress. What if you pictured yourself again?\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You grab the amulet and concentrate as hard as you can on a mental picture of yourself. You remember what you looked like on that beach. You spent the day in T-shirts and swimming trunks. You smiled the whole day.\n\n \n\n Ready to say the words on the note, you remember you need an item. “Grab me that photo on the side! Of me and Jen!”, you shout at Emily. “Quickly!”\n\n \n\n She rushes over to the photo on the side and hands it to you. The first the two of you took together. You snatch it up and focusing hard on the mental picture, start speaking.\n\n \n\n \"From this item, I see you in your time of need. Now form shape to the person I see within.\"\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n Nothing. You say the words again. Still nothing. The warmth from the amulet is just not there. You think you sense the faintest of a warmth against your breasts, but nothing like when you changed.\n\n \n\n “It’s not working,” you finally admit. “Whatever did this,” you say, avoiding the word magic. “It’s not there. Just a flicker.”\n\n \n\n “Maybe we need to wait a while,” Emily says, trying to be helpful. “It might need time to -”\n\n \n\n “Recharge,” you cut her off. “I know. But I have to go to work. And you have to go school.”\n\n \n\n Something clicks in your head. “Who was the girl at school who gave this to you?” you ask.\n\n \n\n “Elizabeth,” Emily replies. “She’s a bit of an outsider. I haven’t spoken to her that much. She’s in my Maths class.”\n\n \n\n “You need to call her!” you blurt out. “Now!”\n\n \n\n “I don’t have her number,” Emily replies. “But she will be at school.”\n\n \n\n “Then you need to go to school and get her to come here!” you say. \n\n \n\n You notice something in Emily’s eyes. A pleading look. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \"What?\" you ask.\n\n \n\n “Well, I was just thinking,” Emily begins. “Liz said the amulet was for someone to help me in my time of need. She gave it to me after I said you were a whizz at Maths and were tutoring me for my exam. And now you look like me.”\n\n \n\n “You’re not serious?” you say, realising her line of thinking.\n\n \n\n “Please !” Emily cries, standing close and looking at you with needy eyes. “You need to talk to Liz, she’s at school, and you could just do my exam whilst you’re there so we don’t have to worry about me failing. I would be able to pass and you could go away with Jennifer!”\n\n \n\n Jennifer. You think about her for a moment. What would she think about all of this.\n\n \n\n *Now you are a girl.*\n\n \n\n “Just think, you could pass my exam for me,” Emily continues. “You can also talk to Liz, and we could everything back to normal by the end of the day.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n “Absolutely not,\" you say. \"I’m not leaving the house like this. Let alone going to school as you and pretending to be my sister.”\n\n \n\n “If I go to school, I’m going to be there for the day,” Emily tells you. “I’m going to have to take that test. And I’ll fail. Then who knows what will happen. To the both of us.”\n\n \n\n You look at your sister, then glance at your reflection in the mirror. You are a spitting image of her. No one would know.\n\n \n\n “It wouldn’t be so hard,” Emily says. “I’ll phone your work and tell them you’re sick. I’ll stay home for the day, and we can reverse this tonight.”\n\n \n\n “You don’t know if it can be reversed,” you reply flatly.\n\n \n\n “We can only try.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \"This is crazy,\" you say, as much to convince yourself. \"It better work.\"\n\n \n \n “Oh it will!” Emily exclaims. “Look, it should be easy. I’ll phone your work and tell them you’re sick. Then I’ll stay home for the day, and you can take my place at school. Then we’ll get Liz and try to reverse this all tonight.”\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n “Alright!” Emily says, and you note there’s a sense of optimism that you haven’t seen in your sister in ages. “I’ll phone your work. Whilst I do that, you can go up to my room and change.”\n\n \n\n “Change?” you say, barely believing what’s about to come.\n\n \n\n “Yes silly!” Emily laughs. “You can’t go to school in a sundress. You need to wear my uniform. I think we’re about the same size!”\n\n \n\n You give her a look and she stops with her playfulness. \"Sorry,\" she says.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n You stand up, adjusting to your new body. As , you were just short of six foot tall. In comparison, Emily, whilst not petite, is at least six inches shorter than you once were. \n\n \n\n As you stand you feel sundress hug your curves and the hem brush against your upper thigh. You have never felt more vulnerable and exposed.\n\n \n\n “Let me know if you have any challenges with anything,” she says, whilst dialling a number on the phone. “Bras take a bit of getting used to.”\n\n \n\n You walk up the stairs, feeling your body swaying as you walk with more pronounced hips. You feel your breasts rising and falling as you breathe. You continually brush back your brunette hair out of your vision.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n **Your home**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home.png]\n\n \n\n You walk down the stairs cautiously, hearing the clip-clop of your heels on the wooden steps. Emily looks over at you from the kitchen and smiles.\n\n \n\n “You look great, ,” she says. “I never really appreciated how pretty I look.”\n\n \n\n “Can you not, please,” you reply.\n\n \n\n Emily apologises and thrusts you her school bag. “Now you’ve got a schedule in there. Just follow that. And meet Michelle at the school gates. Just stay quiet and say you’re tired, then she’ll be able to help.”\n\n \n\n “Did you phone work?” you ask, still getting used to your voice.\n\n \n\n “Yes”, Emily replies. “Someone called Annie answered. She said that your boss won't be happy, but she sends her best wishes.”\n\n \n\n You sigh. To keep your boss happy, you imagine that you'll have to make up the work you're missing today.\n\n \n\n “Alright, here we go,” you say to Emily, stepping towards the front door.\n\n \n\n “Have a good day at school,” she says, parroting the very thing you tell her every morning.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n **Your home**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Home.png]\n\n \n\n It takes you twenty minutes to get home, but the walk is uneventful. More relieved than you can remember ever feeling, you open the front door to see Emily sitting in the sofa watching TV.\n\n \n\n “You’re back!” she says, excitedly. “How did it go? I must admit - it's weird seeing you like this. Until now I was half-convinced it was a dream.”\n\n \n\n You spend the next five minutes recounting the day. Everything you went through, how the test went, and more importantly, everything that Elizabeth told you about the amulet and the school.\n\n \n\n Emily listens intensely, but when you recount Liz’s warning about Charlton, she leans in and hangs on every word. \n\n \n\n “I knew it,” she mutters after you finally finish. “All this time, I’ve felt funny when I was there. Now I know why.” She seems to enter a daze, as if remembering something. But a moment later she shakes her head and stares back at you. \n\n \n\n You realise that in your concern to find a way to get through the day, you have completely forgotten about Emily. Forced to deal with that strange school, its demeaning lessons and sexist teachers, for the entire time you've moved here. You notice her eyes glisten with tears, even as she tries to smile reassuringly. \n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n <>\n \n \"I'm so sorry, Em\", you say.\n\n \n\n Before you can speak another word, she rushes forward and throws her arms around you. You hear her sniffling as she lets her tears run. Not for the first time today, you become acutely aware of your diminished height, as she tries to bury her head in your shoulder. \n\n \n\n \"I thought I was going mad\", she stammers. \"All this time, thinking I wasn't who I thought I was. I felt so alone and afraid.\"\n\n \n\n \"I thought you were just struggling with the move,\" you reply. \"But we'll figure this out. I'll find a way for us to get through this.\"\n\n \n\n \"I don't want to go back there\", you hear her spit out. \n\n \n\n You pull back so you can look at her. Looking into your own current reflection. As tender as you want to be, it feels eerie and uncanny. Her eyes flick across you and you guess she feels the same.\n\n \n\n \"Neither do I,\" you reply to her. \n\n \n\n Your eyes lock on each other's and you stare back in silence. The reality sets in. Like it or not, for at least the time being one of you is going to have to go back there tomorrow.\n\n \n\n “First things first,” she says, wiping the tears from her eyes. “Let’s reverse this amulet.” She hands you the amulet and the photo of you and Jen. Much to your delight, the emerald is glowing green and is warm to the touch.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \"I don't want to go back there,\" you say. \n\n \n\n A rush of tears suddenly streams from your eyes, and you find yourself sobbing. You feel Emily draw her arms around you into a comforting embrace. You bury your head in her shoulder. Not for the first time today, you become acutely aware of your diminished height. \n\n \n\n \"I feel like I'm going mad,\" you stammer. \"This can't be happening to me.\"\n\n \n\n \"It's okay,\" you hear Emily say, stroking your long hair. \"We'll get through this together.\"\n\n \n\n \"I don't want to go back there,\" you spit out. \n\n \n\n You feel her pull your head back and you stare into her eyes. A reflection of you. A reminder of what you've become and what you've been through today. It feels eerie and uncanny. Her eyes flick across you and you guess she feels the same.\n\n \n\n \"Neither do I,\" she replies.\n\n \n\n Your eyes lock on each other's and you stare back in silence. The reality sets in. Like it or not, for at least the time being one of you is going to have to go back there tomorrow.\n\n \n\n “First things first,” Emily says, wiping the tears from your eyes. “Let’s reverse this amulet.” She hands you the amulet and the photo of you and Jen. Much to your delight, the emerald is glowing green and is warm to the touch.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You put on the amulet, feeling its warmth already against your breasts. You remember the image of yourself on the beach. A happy go-lucky twenty-something in swimming trunks and a T-shirt, with a skinny body and short hair. In a nutshell, you think of you. \n\n \n\n “Here we go again,” you say to Emily. You concentrate, and recite the words.\n\n \n\n “From this item, I see you in your time of need. Now form shape to the person I see within.”\n\n \n\n The energy fuses out of the emerald, but this time you are ready for it. The pain is still unbearable, but you focus on the picture in your mind. Your face. Your skinny body. Your hairy legs. Your penis.\n\n \n\n You squeal as you feel your body crunching and changing again, but you fight to remain conscious. Suddenly, it’s over. \n\n \n\n There is silence in the room. You take a deep breath and look down to see your flat chest and loose swimming trunks. You can’t help but cry out in joy.\n\n \n\n “Oh my god - , it worked!” Emily cries, and runs over to hug you. You hug her back, remembering that you’re taller than her and you can wrap her up in a big hug to celebrate.\n\n \n\n \"I've never been so happy with my body!\" you tell her, recognising your own voice again coming out of your body.\n\n \n\n “Thank god!” Emily says. “I don’t think I could have explained to mum and dad how I now had a twin sister! This calls for celebration - I’ll order some pizza!”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n You sit around with Emily, waiting for the pizza delivery to arrive. Thanks to staff shortages, it’s late, but you don’t mind. Nothing can faze you tonight.\n\n \n\n Whilst waiting, you reply to some phone messages that have gotten through the bad reception. A few people from work checking in on you, your boss checking if you’ll be at work tomorrow. \n\n \n\n Most importantly are the text messages from Jennifer. You give her a call and talk to her, placating any fears she might have had in you not responding to her for a whole day.\n\n \n\n “I’m feeling much better now,” you tell her. “Just one of those twenty-four hour things.”\n\n \n\n “Do you want to come over?” she offers. “I can be a good nurse for you.”\n\n \n\n You chuckle. “Tempting, but I should get some sleep.”\n\n \n\n “Will you come over tomorrow, then?” she asks. “I can cook us dinner, if you want?”\n\n \n\n You tell her that would be nice and you will come round after work.\n\n \n\n “Love you,” she says. \n\n \n\n You hear Emily shouting up to your room that the pizza has arrived. “Love you too,” you tell Jennifer. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n You go downstairs and see Emily has already spread the pizza across the now clear kitchen table. “No more study books?” you ask Emily.\n\n \n\n “Not for a while, at least,” she replies, happy.\n\n \n\n She grabs a slice and you do the same. You savour the sensation of eating in your own body. Everything feels so perfect.\n\n \n\n “, what are you going to do now?” Emily asks.\n\n \n\n “What do you mean?” you say in-between eating pizza. \n\n \n\n Emily looks at you hesitantly. “You might have helped me today, but if Liz is right there’s a whole school that needs help too. I was just wondering what you were going to do. Now that we know.\"\n\n \n\n “The smart thing to do would be to leave,” you reply flatly.\n\n \n\n “You know I can’t do that,” Emily says. “What would we tell our parents? What would they do if I dropped out of school? What would they ask you to do if I had to resit my entire year elsewhere?”\n\n \n\n You finish off another slice of pizza, trying to find a way out of this conversation by not speaking.\n\n \n\n “There’s a lot of people here. That could use someone helping them.” Emily looks to you. “Including me. Who knows what that school will do to me if it’s not stopped?”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \"What do you expect me to do?\" you ask Emily, with a slight tone of exasperation.\n\n \n\n “I don't expect you to do anything,” Emily says. “You've already gone through the weirdest day of your life, . No one could expect you to do anything like that again. It's just that... you don't need magic to do some snooping around.\"\n\n \n\n \"You want me to figure out what's going on?\" you ask her flatly.\n\n \n\n She nods. \"Use that amulet or not. But help the people here and get to the bottom of what’s going on. And stop it. After all, you can go back to work tomorrow. I have to go back to that school.\"\n\n \n\n You pick up the amulet that still rests around your neck and finger it gingerly, mulling it over. “I need to think about this,” you say. \n\n \n\n “Sure, take your time,” Emily replies. “But just remember what happened to you today. I have to go through that everyday.\"\n\n \n\n You smile sadly, thinking it through. “Too much has happened today, Em. I need to rest on it.” You stand. “I’m going to bed.” \n\n \n\n She nods. “Alright. Sleep tight.”\n\n \n\n “You too.”\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",

    "text": "**Your room**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Room_1.png]\n\n \n\n You wake up and momentarily feel sluggish and unsure of your surroundings. Then it dawns on you. The room, though still foreign, is at least full of your clothes and belongings. It’s your new’ish bedroom, in this new’ish house, in this new’ish town called Charlton that you moved to just two months ago.\n\n \n\n You debated for a week whether you’d move with your parents when they announced they were moving to a quiet town away from the city. All your friends were there and you had a job as a software developer that paid at least a little. But your parents made the argument that your sister, Emily, still had a year to go in school. Someone needed to look after her. \n\n \n\n What you didn’t realise was that not three weeks after moving, your mother and father would pack up and go to Italy for an extended vacation. A business trip, they said. Business so vital that they would leave you in a new town to look after your sister, but not enough to stop your younger brother from going to University as planned. \n\n \n\n Still, it hasn’t been all bad. As an educated man of twenty-five, you quickly found a new job developing a booking system for one of the local businesses. Even better, you found that the slim pickings of new men on dating apps meant you landed a wonderful girlfriend, Jennifer. She's about the best thing that has ever happened to you.\n\n \n\n Now all you have to do is get your sister through her final year at school and make sure she gets the grades she needs to go to University. Then you’ll be free to finally move out of your parents' house and see the world like you planned. With the added bonus of having Jennifer along for the ride.\n\n \n\n Speaking of, you remember you agreed to help Emily study for her big Maths exam tomorrow. In spite of being a Sunday, you've been called into work today, but an hour tutoring might make the difference between her passing or failing. You put on some clothes and get ready for the day ahead.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n Your dreams are muddled and fragmented. You see Emily's face wincing, her eyes full of tears. A maths textbook flutters in the wind, equations falling out and taken away by the breeze.\n\n \n\n And everything is tinted by a yellow-amber hue, emanating from a green gem that grows larger by the minute. A coy smile presses through its edges, the lips unmistakably those from a woman.\n \n \n\n \n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n /* Clear deltas */\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n **Your room**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Room_1.png]\n\n \n\n You wake up and have the same sense of strangeness for a brief moment. Your room. Your new room. Your new life.\n\n \n\n Then you remember. Today is Emily’s test. You said you’d help her in the kitchen do some last minute cramming for her exam.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>\n\n \n **Your room**\n\n [image: ./images/Your_Room_1.png]\n\n \n\n You go upstairs to your room and shut the door. You put the amulet down on your bedside cabinet and take off your clothes. Firstly, your T-shirt and then your swimming shorts. You look at yourself in the mirror.\n\n \n\n \n You see your reflection as you. A skinny man of twenty-five, with a penis and short hair. You think about your girlfriend, Jennifer, and you feel a familiar stirring in your loins. Everything seems to be working perfectly.\n\n \n\n Hidden beneath your T-shirt though and away from the prying eyes of Emily is cause for concern. Where you previously had a flat chest, you now have two small mounds on your chest. Your nipples are bigger and you notice they harden when you think about Jennifer. You wouldn’t exactly call them breasts, but they definitely weren’t there before.\n\n \n\n You reach up and give one of your nipples a brush with your finger. You gasp. The sensitivity is alien to you. It’s also alarming. And you hate to admit it, but it’s not unpleasant. You caress your nipples a little more and hear yourself moan in arousal.\n\n \n\n Your eyes drift down to your penis. You notice it immediately. It’s smaller. A lot smaller. Even stirring from the thought of Jennifer, you can tell it’s no longer the size it once was. Even more troubling, it reacts and stiffens when you play with your nipples.\n\n \n\n You gulp. You look over at the amulet and think about all the things that happened today, remembering Liz’s attempt to warn you about the spell shaping the person you see within. \n\n \n\n Climbing into bed, you push the thought from your mind. Tomorrow is a new day. But how can you just return back to normal when you now know of the danger that Jennifer, and especially Emily, faces. Shouldn’t you look to help them if you can?\n\n \n\n Slowly, you drift off to sleep. Beside you, the cold amulet starts to recharge once more. \n\n \n You see your reflection as you.

The sound is alien to you. You still can’t believe that this is your body and you are dressed like this.\n\n \n\n A van drives by and you jump as the driver beeps his horn. You look up and see Martin the delivery driver grinning at you lecherously as he passes.\n\n \n\n Wanting to avoid any other attention, you keep your head down and walk towards the school entrance.\n\n \n\n **Actions**\n\n <>",
